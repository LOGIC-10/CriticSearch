Some countries such as the US and UK are conducting research but have not announced an intention to begin CBDC development, while others - including China and Sweden - have launched live pilot programs.3 Motivations cited by central banks for pursuing CBDCs include maintaining control over monetary policy, financial inclusion,4 traceability of transactions for anti-money laundering (AML) and tax purposes, and improved cross-border payments.5 Critics have been quick to note that CBDCs could pose data security and privacy concerns as well as reduce deposits at banks, which could reduce liquidity in the financial system.6 While it will likely take years to launch a digital dollar if the US decides to pursue its development, there are steps that financial institutions can take now to prepare themselves for potential domestic and global shifts toward CBDCs. This Regulatory brief provides our perspective on how CBDCs could impact the business models of financial institutions as well as how existing custody, blockchain, cybersecurity and other functions can be adapted to support CBDCs. 6 For more information, see the Bank Policy Institute\\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs, Benefits and Major Implications for the U.S. Economic System (April 2021).\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: [PDF] The impact of central bank digital currency on central bank ...\\nURL: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op360~35915b25bd.en.pdf\\nCONTENT: ECB Occasional Paper Series No 360 1 Contents Abstract 2 Non-technical summary 3 1 Introduction 5 2 CBDC: a future monetary liability of central banks 8 2.1 The \\u201cendogeneity\\u201d of the CBDC issuance decision and emerging CBDC design features 8 2.2 Issuance of CBDC and the central bank\\u2019s balance sheet 11 3 The impact of CBDC on central bank profitability \\u2013 measured by net interest income 15 3.1 Methodological approach 15 3.2 Profit projections with CBDC \\u2013 baseline analyses using euro area data as an example 18 3.3 Sensitivity analyses 21 4 Impact of CBDC on central bank financial risk-taking 26 5 Impact of CBDC on central bank capital and net equity 30 6 Conclusion 33 7 References 35 ECB Occasional Paper Series No 360 2 Abstract As digital payments become increasingly popular, many central banks are looking into the issuance of retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a new central bank monetary liability in addition to banknotes and commercial bank reserves.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: [PDF] Working Paper on Central Bank Digital Currency - CBDC - BfDI\\nURL: https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Berlin-Group/20240613_WP-Cental-Bank-Digital-Currency-EN.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2\\nCONTENT: Jun 13, 2024 \\u00b7 provide financial entities involved, such as central and commercial banks, with unprecedented access ...

In fact, there is considerable demand for currencies with low transaction costs, particularly for international transactions or for micro-contributions and micro-payments. [For example, the e-yuan has a transaction cost of 0.1%, compared with the 2% that credit card companies may charge].High transaction costsAny asset has the potential to be used as a currency, but very few succeed in becoming a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. Bitcoin, in particular, is a long way from achieving this. Bitcoin's transaction costs are still high. What's more, it has not yet adopted the two-sided payment card model (which involves charging the merchant and not the buyer, or even subsidizing the latter through discounts or free miles for using the card); today bitcoin serves essentially, at least in developed countries, as a store of value/speculative tool and has few benefits for transactions, apart from illegal ones.High volatilityThe very high volatility of cryptocurrency values is another factor making their use as a unit of account for contracts unlikely. This is why some cryptocurrencies are designed as stablecoins; the most important of these stablecoins today is Tether. The idea is to match the cryptocurrency with a collateral that guarantees its value. This collateral can take several forms. It can consist of securities issued in a traditional currency (such as the dollar), for example Treasury bills, or tomorrow a central bank digital currency (CBDC). These reserves must then be in sufficient quantity to peg the cryptocurrency to the chosen currency. But, of course, this requires an attentive prudential supervisor. For, as with all financial institutions, there is a strong temptation to invest in riskier, higher-yield assets than in relatively safe but low-yield ones (which is why the monitoring of the liquidity requirements imposed on banks by Basel 3 regulations is always a tricky business). In fact, in 2021, Tether, whose dollar reserves were supposed to correspond 1 for 1 to the number of tokens, was ordered by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to pay $41 million for claiming to be 100% covered by fiat currency, when in fact only 27.6% was covered. In addition, the platform may wish to grant loans to affiliated companies, which it must be prevented from doing.The need for a regulatorThere are, of course, other possible forms of collateral: financial assets, stored commodities (durable goods), raw materials, or even... other crypto-currencies (which might be useful if the values of crypto-currencies were negatively correlated, but unfortunately they seem to be positively correlated). In any case, only a prudential regulator, such as the ones for banks, can guarantee the public that the institution doesn't get too comfortable with the rules it has laid down.Moreover the nationality of this regulator is an important issue as crypto-currencies and the corresponding investors are totally global. One of the traditional roles of the banking regulator is to protect small depositors, SMEs and other regulated institutions against the risk of bankruptcy of the bank where their savings or liquid assets are deposited: see my book with Mathias Dewatripont The Prudential Regulation of Banks (MIT Press, 1994) for a discussion of the philosophy of prudential supervision. A national regulator may in fact be torn between the desire to enhance the attractiveness of its financial center (by attracting cryptocurrency-related businesses) and that of protecting those investors located on its territory, who are only a fraction of all investors, which therefore leads it to favor the former objective.The central position of the statesAgainst this backdrop, competition for leadership in digital payments will take place among at least three groups of players: decentralized cryptocurrencies, sponsored private currencies (Libra/Diem or any other Big Tech currency) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Central banks were late to enter this market, despite the competitive advantages they enjoy: the state decides what is legal tender, and can therefore force at least an optional use of its currency. This option becomes an obligation when it comes to the payment of taxes and other state levies. Finally, the state can force banks and fintech to join the state platform, as was the case for the renminbi in China and for Pix (a digital payments platform managed by the central bank) in Brazil. States will also be able to enter into agreements to make international transfers cheap, by ensuring that they are carried out automatically at the exchange rate prevailing on a highly liquid CBDC currency market. Finally, and mirroring the point already made in the previous article in this dossier about crypto-currencies, the positive benefit of CBDCs can quickly change sign in an autocratic state. The digital aspect of CBDCs will facilitate the surveillance and repression of citizens. Any additional power given to states requires the existence of the rule of law.Who will access CBDCs?The contours of this central bank digital currency have yet to be defined. In particular, who will be able to hold CBDCs, and in what proportions? Retail depositors? Those holding wholesale deposits (uninsured deposits)? What competition will there be for bank deposits? On this last point, there seems to be an emerging consensus that banks should not be drained of their stable funds. According to China's central bank, \\\"the new digital currency is not intended to replace deposits in bank accounts and balances held by payment apps such as Alipay and WeChat\\\". Similarly, a 2020 report from seven major central banks and the Bank for International Settlements defines the first of its three core principles in the following terms: \\\"Coexistence with cash and other types of currency in a flexible and innovative payment system.\\\" Be that as it may, we must once again remember the economic fundamentals.The digital revolution, by facilitating the introduction of new currencies, foreshadows intense competition between the private and public sectors and among countries to offer efficient services for savings, transactions and contract writing. While it's difficult to predict the outcome, we can bet that the few economic fundamentals discussed in this article will be at the center of developments.Not all deposits can be guaranteed and/or demandableFirst and foremost, not all deposits in financial institutions are supposed to be guaranteed (protected in the event of the institution's difficulties). The risk-free nature of retail deposits up to a certain limit (\\u20ac100k in France per depositor and per institution) is currently guaranteed by the State. Ideally, this guarantee is provided by a sufficiently robust deposit guarantee fund; failing that, it comes from a bailout by the state, provided the latter is solvent. In normal times, however, deposits are covered by loans (narrow banking is suboptimal). It should also be noted that Basel's prudential supervision rules now rightly insist on a minimum amount of equity and bailinable liabilities for banks. Unfortunately, all too often, deposit guarantees apply to all depositors, whether or not the deposits are insured, as we saw again recently with the near-bankruptcy of Cr\\u00e9dit Suisse.Secondly, not all deposits in financial institutions are supposed to be demandable. If the transformation function of banks can be schematized by the characterization that banks on average accept demand deposits and lend on a long-term basis, it is normal for banks to have a portion of their liabilities in securities that are only payable at term (and compensate investors for this concession). This partly limits the banks\\u2019 liquidity risk.What to do?Broader access to CBDCs would considerably increase the size of safe demand deposits. Is this desirable? Let's not forget that, if a significant part of the banks' liabilities were transferred to the central bank, the government would be obliged to grant loans to compensate for the lost bank loans. However, the government generally lacks the necessary expertise to grant loans; it may also show favoritism for political ends in granting these loans; and lastly, it may be too lenient with insolvent borrowers (the \\\"soft budget constraint\\\" phenomenon). A more conservative approach would be to limit the amount per capita that can be held in CBDCs. CBDCs would de facto be the new insured deposits of individuals, and would pay the deposit insurance premium. The advantage of CBDCs would then be greater ease of use and low transaction costs for households.Published in La Jaune & la Rouge, n\\u00b0 792, February 2024,https://www.lajauneetlarouge.com/magazine/792/Illustration Photo de Andr\\u00e9 Fran\\u00e7ois McKenzie sur UnsplashFebruary 01, 2024Cryptocurrencies: an economist's viewFebruary 05, 2024Financing the ecological transition in Sub-Saharan AfricaAuthorJean TiroleShareSame themeMay 23, 2024How can we convince farmers to use smart water meters?January 25, 2024How should we allocate capital and share risks?December 11, 2023Low-carbon transition: what impact on companies' cost of capital?\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/standards-and-interoperability-the-future-of-the-global-financial-system/\\nTitle: Untitled\\nContent:\\nDigital CurrenciesEconomy & BusinessFinancial RegulationIssue BriefApril 10, 2024Print this pageStandards and interoperability: The future of the global financial systemByAnanya Kumar, Alisha Chhangani, Jennifer Lassiter, and Katherine HaarTable of contentsIntroductionThe call for standardsDefining standardsA comprehensive overview of current standards on digital assetsLessons learned from standard-setting effortsEstablishing standardsKey themes for a CBDC frameworkConclusionAbstractOver the past few years, the global financial landscape has undergone a significant transformation marked by the emergence and integration of digital assets. Looking ahead, the global financial terrain is set to include a spectrum of both sovereign and nonsovereign digital currencies and both centralized and decentralized networks. This future brings the promise of enhanced efficiency, inclusion, transparency, and choice to global payments. To fulfill this promise, the international community must develop interoperability standards that prioritize a fast, highly scalable, and resilient architecture. The flexibility of this architecture to adapt configurability based on policy and economic considerations is critical to its success.This working paper is a foundational step toward a broader, global dialogue about digital asset standards. The Digital Dollar Project and the Atlantic Council\\u2019s GeoEconomics Center hosted a global convening titled \\u201cExploring Central Bank Digital Currency: Evaluating Challenges and Developing International Standards\\u201d in November 2023. A version of this paper was released as a working paper to level set the attendees of the conference and provide a call to engage the public and the private sector in standard-setting efforts. This paper was further developed based on feedback from the conference and outreach afterward. The paper now reflects what we learned from our convening and incorporates the most recent developments in standard-setting efforts globally. The rapid growth of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) worldwide underscores the importance of aligning approaches to their development, adoption, and implementation across technical, regulatory, and governance levels. Today, there is a patchwork of first steps undertaken by both public-and private-sector entities, aimed at achieving different objectives. These efforts have focused on frameworks, guiding principles, and, in some cases, the development of standards for digital assets broadly, as described below. Some are CBDC-specific and others have general applicability in the payments sector. As governments and stakeholders collaborate to establish consistent benchmarks for CBDC development, it\\u2019s crucial to identify, organize, and align standard-setting endeavors. This process involves assessing existing efforts to pinpoint gaps and create a foundation for international standards that remain open and flexible for future development and innovation. Through this paper, we show the crucial element of interoperability, which is needed for the furtherance of standards on CBDCs and digital assets. We attempt to build the pressing themes around which standards will have to be addressed through existing and new efforts.IntroductionIn recent years, the global financial landscape has witnessed a profound transformation characterized by the accelerated rise and integration of digital assets. As a subset of these assets, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have captivated the interest of countries worldwide.1Atlantic Council, \\u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency Tracker,\\u201d Atlantic Council, last updated December 2023,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/.The CBDC landscape has rapidly evolved with 130 countries, representing 98 percent of the global economy, actively researching and, in some cases, deploying CBDCs. A recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) revealed that the number of central banks likely to issue a CBDC within the next three years has grown in the past year from 15 percent to 18 percent for retail CBDCs (rCBDC) and from 8 percent to 15 percent for wholesale CBDCs (wCBDC).2Bank for International Settlements (BIS),Central Bank Digital Currency: Motivations and Implications, BIS Papers no. 136, November 2020,https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.htm.CBDCs, in their promise and potential, are emblematic of a broader shift\\u2014a movement toward a more efficient, frictionless digital infrastructure, shaping the future of international trade, cross-border payments, and global financial integration. However, with transformative potential comes inherent complexity. As fiat currencies become more intertwined with technology there are significant implications for privacy, human rights, cybersecurity, digital financial inclusion, and the movement of money across borders for international trade, aid, investment, and other payments. If designed without a common framework of standards and collaboration, a shortsighted and fragmented approach to CBDC development could lead to the emergence ofwalled gardens.At the core of establishing standards lies the concept of interoperability\\u2014the ability for diverse systems to interact seamlessly and reduce friction. In this context, interoperability extends beyond technical objectives alone; it requires a broader framework including regulatory and governance standards, paving the way for streamlined cross-border transactions, reduced operational friction, and bolstered trust among participating entities. While not a panacea, technical, regulatory, and governance benchmarks are instrumental in navigating the complexities of the international payments systems. In order to achieve interoperability, CBDC exploration should prioritize a thorough discussion on establishing technical, regulatory, and governance standards. (See Annex 1 for definitions relevant to this discussion.)This paper is intended as a catalyst to stimulate a broader, global dialogue about CBDC standards. It takes stock of existing activities, begins to define how these efforts may be coordinated and aggregated into a set of globally accepted best practices, and offers a baseline for addressing gaps or deficiencies in defining best practices.The call for standardsCBDCs are a digital form of a country\\u2019s national currency, issued and backed by the country\\u2019s central bank. They come in two forms: retail CBDCs (rCBDC), accessible to individual consumers and usable for everyday purchases and peer-to-peer payments, and wholesale CBDCs (wCBDC), utilized by financial institutions or other major entities for interbank settlements and large financial transactions. The motivations behind rCBDCs and wCBDCs are distinct. The deployment of rCBDCs is usually motivated by financial inclusion, payment efficiency, privacy, and safety. Interest in wCBDCs is aimed at addressing cross-border friction to improve international payments\\u2014including limited operating hours, long transaction chains, restrictions on legacy technology platforms, data fragmentation, high costs, complex funding, and compliance issues.3Josh Lipsky and Ananya Kumar, \\u201cIt\\u2019s Official: The United States Is Developing a Bank-to-Bank Digital Currency,\\u201dNew Atlanticist, Atlantic Council, December 15, 2022,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/its-official-the-united-states-is-developing-a-bank-to-bank-digital-currency/.Ultimately, rCBDCs and wCBDCs would operate in conjunction with each other to achieve both the domestic and cross-border needs of a country.4BIS, \\u201cProject Icebreaker Concludes Experiment for a New Architecture for Cross-border Retail CBDCs,\\u201d March 5, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/icebreaker.htm.Therefore, the deployment of domestic CBDCs must not be considered in isolation or the result will be walled gardens that stand apart from global commerce and economic trends. Creating a CBDC in a silo is unlikely to achieve the desired outcomes in the short or long term, as it will replicate the friction of the existing payments systems. CBDCs\\u2019 potential to provide a simpler and more efficient way to move money can only be realized as long as the CBDCs can interoperate with one another.If deployed, a CBDC must be able to operate across various transactions, institutions, and users. Many CBDC initiatives and explorations recognize the complex and interconnected ecosystem in which financial activity takes place and the interdependencies of the different participants in transaction settlements. By agreeing on standards upfront\\u2014which is by no means a simple task\\u2014CBDCs can hopefully escape some of the growing pains that we have seen with the development of new financial technology (such as automated teller machines that could only be used by customers of a specific bank) or new digital technology (such as the challenges posed by the early years of closed-loop email).Concentrating on developing and implementing clear and accessible global standards can enable greater industry collaboration and competitiveness through interoperability, transferability, consistency, and safety across various industries and economies. With this clarity, countries can direct their efforts toward aligning and promoting key principles such as privacy, free enterprise, the rule of law, and economic liberty within the global financial landscape.5The Digital Dollar Project:Exploring a US CBDC, Digital Dollar Foundation and Accenture, May 2020,https://digitaldollarproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Dollar-Project-Whitepaper_vF_7_13_20.pdf.Defining standardsAt the heart of this paper is the effort to promote interoperability in payments systems and prevent the creation ofwalled gardens. We therefore define standards as the technical, regulatory, and governance benchmarks needed to achieve interoperable systems in the long run. It is crucial to recognize that standards do not emerge arbitrarily; instead, they evolve from fundamental principles, embodying intentional consideration and consensus.Standards specific to CBDCs are not unchanging; they must reflect and be responsive to technological development, market shifts, and experience. Standards are established by technical and governance bodies, often made up of diverse stakeholders, and reflect a consistent floor for pragmatic implementation across jurisdictions. Therefore, they must have built-in flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances across a variety of market structures.Our use of a narrow definition of standards as a means to achieve interoperable payments systems helps navigate the complex technical, governance, and regulatory environment. In the following section, we catalog existing standards for digital assets and the institutions responsible for setting them.A comprehensive overview of current standards on digital assetsMethodologyDue to their rapid growth, global standard-setting bodies have had to regulate and harmonize the adoption and use of digital assets across borders. In this section we provide an overview of the prominent organizations that play a pivotal role in shaping the digital asset landscape. Understanding the functions, roles, and importance of these bodies is critical for fostering a safe, competitive, and inclusive digital economy. We explore global governance institutions\\u2014the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank for International Settlements\\u2014as well as regulatory standard setters\\u2014the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), and the Financial Stability Board (FSB)\\u2014and technical bodies like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Since rCBDC projects have largely been in the pilot, development, and research stage while wCBDC projects are currently limited, standard-setting efforts in some bodies have focused on broader digital asset developments.International Monetary FundAs a key institution in international monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability, the IMF is instrumental in assisting its 190 member countries in managing economic change. Its expertise in macrofinancial surveillance can help identify vulnerabilities associated with digital assets and it can offer policy advice to enhance the resilience of economies.In November 2023, the IMF released a virtual handbook on CBDCs, designed as a comprehensive guide for policymakers and experts in central banks and finance ministries. The plan for this evolving handbook is to offer about twenty chapters by 2026, with periodic updates to reflect the latest findings and viewpoints.6International Monetary Fund (IMF),Central Bank Digital Currency Virtual Handbook, last updated November 2023,https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/fintech/central-bank-digital-currency/virtual-handbook.The initial chapters address key topics like the framework for exploring CBDCs, product development, impacts on monetary policy, capital flow management, and financial inclusion.A publication called IMF Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency Capacity Development, released in April 2023, outlines the IMF\\u2019s efforts to facilitate peer learning and develop analytical underpinnings for advising member countries on CBDCs. In addition to research, the IMF provides technical assistance, including the XC platform initiative.7IMF,IMF Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency Capacity Development, Policy Paper, April 12, 2023,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2023/04/12/IMF-Approach-to-Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-Capacity-Development-532177.The XC platform, proposes a global centralized ledger to simplify and streamline cross-border payments. This initiative builds on the concept of wholesale CBDCs, but the platform includes commercial banks, payment providers, and central banks within a single, streamlined system. The XC model aims to reduce transaction costs and settlement times, making it an attractive option for countries looking to enhance their cross-border payment systems.Described as a \\u201cdigital town square,\\u201d the XC platform would build a three-layer architecture: a settlement layer that acts as the primary ledger, a programming layer for executing smart contracts, and an information layer designed to protect personal data while ensuring compliance and facilitating currency controls as needed.8Tobias Adrian and Tommaso Mancini Griffoli, \\u201cThe Rise of Payment and Contracting Platforms,\\u201d Fintech Notes No. 2023/005 (International Monetary Fund, June 19, 2023),https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fintech-notes/Issues/2023/06/16/The-Rise-of-Payment-and-Contracting-Platforms-534794.The platform\\u2019s architecture is designed to be open and upgradeable, ensuring its longevity and adaptability to future innovations. Instead of adopting CBDCs, central banks can issue certificates of escrow (CE) for use exclusively on the XC platform. CEs enhance financial accessibility by granting more entities, including nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), payment-system providers (PSPs), and nonresidents, direct access to central bank reserves. These certificates share characteristics with CBDCs and can later be converted into central bank reserves by financial institutions. According to the IMF, a key advantage of using CEs is that it allows countries to prioritize domestic use cases for their CBDC projects, while CEs can be used solely for cross-border transactions.9Tobias Adrian, \\u201cA Cross-Border Payments, Exchange, and Contracting Platform for the 21st Century,\\u201d International Monetary Fund, November 18, 2022,https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/11/18/sp-cross-border-payments-exchange-contracting-platform-21st-century.The XC model is designed for wide-ranging compatibility with existing systems, requiring central banks to make only minor technical updates. The model is a policy and regulatory framework; it encourages countries to adopt consistent and supportive regulations for cross-border payments, potentially incorporating tokens and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). In order for the model to work, however, it will need compatible legal and regulatory frameworks to effectively manage risks and ensure compliance across various jurisdictions. Tobias Adrian, Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the IMF, furtherexplainedthis point at ourconferencein November 2023.Bank for International SettlementsThe BIS acts as the central bank for central banks, fostering monetary and financial stability globally. It actively explores the impact of digital currencies on the financial system and central bank operations. The BIS Innovation Hub facilitates research and development on digital innovation, helping member countries adapt to the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Its membership consists of sixty-three central banks and monetary authorities.10\\u201cMember Central Banks,\\u201d BIS, n.d.,https://www.bis.org/about/member_cb.htm.Recent significant projects include Project Mariana, which tested cross-border trading using CBDCs and decentralized finance technology, and Project Icebreaker, which focused on using retail CBDCs for international payments through a novel hub-and-spoke model, both completing their testing phase in 2023.11\\u201cBIS Innovation Hub projects,\\u201d BIS, accessed November 26, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/projects.htm?m=268&#8203.Most recently, Project Sela, a collaboration between the BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre, the Bank of Israel, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, focused on exploring rCBDC features including accessibility, cyber security, and effective public-private collaboration, with an emphasis on central banks overseeing retail ledgers and private intermediaries managing customer-facing services.12B\\u00e9n\\u00e9dicte Nolens, \\u201cProject Sela: An Accessible and Secure Retail CBDC Ecosystem,\\u201d a joint experiment by BIS and the central banks of Hong Kong SAR and Israel, September 12, 2023.In July 2023, the BIS presented the results of a survey showing that 93 percent of central banks are engaged in CBDC work, with retail CBDC development more advanced than wholesale CBDC.13Anneke Kosse and Ilaria Mattei, \\u201cMaking Headway\\u2013Results of the 2022 BIS Survey on Central Bank Digital Currencies and Crypto,\\u201d BIS Papers no. 136, BIS, July 10, 2023,https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.htm.The survey reveals most central banks recognize the value of having both a retail CBDC and a fast payment system.14Kosse and Mattei, \\u201cMaking Headway.\\u201dBy 2030, there could be fifteen retail and nine wholesale CBDCs publicly circulating, while stablecoins and crypto assets are rarely used for payments outside the crypto ecosystem.15Kosse and Mattei, \\u201cMaking Headway.\\u201dThis BIS finding followed its June 2021 report discussing its survey on CBDCs, which found that many central banks had not decided on issuing a CBDC, but had a tentative inclination toward allowing cross-border use by tourists and nonresidents. In March 2021, the BIS explored the potential for multi-CBDC (mCBDC) arrangements to improve cross-border payments by leveraging interoperable central bank digital currencies. Technology could play a role in addressing inefficiencies, and the paper discusses the dimensions of payment system interoperability and the benefits of mCBDC arrangements.16\\u201cProject mBridge: Experimenting with a Multi-CBDC Platform for Cross-border Payments,\\u201d BIS, last updated October 31, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/mcbdc_bridge.htm.The BIS Universal Ledger interoperability model advocates for a shared global ledger that integrates various forms of money\\u2014including CBDCs, tokenized deposits, and other digital financial assets\\u2014into a single, programmable environment. The BIS aims to address the inefficiencies and silos present in the financial system by enabling safer transactions and atomic settlements within a transparent framework.The architecture of the unified ledger model is designed to be secure, scalable, and interoperable, with a strong emphasis on privacy and regulatory compliance. At its core, the architecture includes a data environment for securely storing digital asset representations, like CBDCs and tokenized deposits, in organized partitions managed by authoritative entities such as central banks and commercial banks. The execution environment facilitates the automation of complex financial operations and secure, efficient transaction processing. This environment supports atomic settlement, ensuring comprehensive transaction success or complete rollback. In addition, to safeguard sensitive data and transaction privacy, the model implements cryptographic methods like homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. These technologies enable encrypted data computation without exposing the actual data, reinforcing the system\\u2019s privacy and security. An important component of the BIS project is the governance framework that establishes operational and regulatory compliance protocols, while also detailing the responsibilities of all involved parties, including central and commercial banks.Unlike the XC model, which builds on blockchain solutions, the BIS\\u2019s unified ledger approach uses application programming interfaces (APIs), creating a more centralized system where transactions have to be processed and validated by authorized entities, such as central banks or designated financial institutions.17Adrian, \\u201cCross-Border Payments.\\u201dWithin this system, central bank money can circulate on a platform that is not owned and operated by the central bank, which can present risks. It also raises questions about the security, control, and integrity of central bank money when it is managed outside the traditional central banking systems.The BIS favors a system grounded in central bank money, offering a sounder basis for innovation, stable and interoperable services across borders, and a virtuous circle of trust through network effects.18Agust\\u00edn Carstens, \\u201cThe Future Monetary System: From Vision to Reality,\\u201d Keynote Speech at the CBDC & Future Monetary System Seminar, Seoul, Korea, November 23, 2023, via BIS site,https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp231123.htm.Basel Committee on Banking SupervisionThe BCBS is the global body for setting prudential standards for banking supervision and regulation.

Its recommendations function as guidance on regulating virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to ensure the prevention of illicit financial activities. More than 200 jurisdictions have committed to implementing FATF standards, making the organization a key player in shaping regulatory frameworks to maintain transparency and security in the digital asset sphere.21Financial Action Task Force (FATF), FATF,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html.FATF has thirty-eight member countries, including major economies and financial centers worldwide.22That number includes the Russian Federation, whose membership has been suspended. See \\u201cFATF Member Countries,\\u201d FATF website,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html.FATF has published several papers related to virtual assets and VASPs. The first version of its Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and VASPs, released in June 2019, focused on risk assessment and monitoring, particularly for issues of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).23FATF,Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, 2019,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets.html.A twelve-month review of the revised FATF standards on virtual assets and VASPs was conducted in July 2020, showing progress in implementing these standards among some jurisdictions, but not yet sufficient progress to create a global AML/CFT regime for virtual assets.24FATF,Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach: Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, October 2021,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html.A second twelve-month review in June 2022 revealed continued progress, but indicated that implementation was still insufficient and certain challenges remained, such as the implementation of the \\u201ctravel rule.\\u201d25Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, FATF, June 2022,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html.This rule is a legal obligation that requires financial institutions\\u2014such as banks and cryptocurrency service providers\\u2014to collect and share detailed information about the parties involved in a financial transaction.To address these challenges and based on the two reviews, FATF published Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and VASPs in October 2021. This guidance includes updates in six key areas, including clarifying the definitions of virtual assets and VASPs, guidance on stablecoins, and additional guidance on peer-to-peer transactions and information-sharing among VASP supervisors.26FATF, \\u201cUpdated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers.\\u201dHowever, the latest update on the implementation, published in June 2023, indicated that jurisdictions still struggle with fundamental requirements.27FATF, \\u201cVirtual Assets: Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers,\\u201d June 27, 2023,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2023.html.The report also emphasizes the need for appropriate risk identification and mitigation measures, especially for decentralized finance (or DeFi) and unhosted wallets (e.g., controlled by the owner rather than a platform or exchange manager), which have the potential for misuse. In 2020, FATF has also reported to the Group of Twenty (G20) on stablecoins, outlining its specific views on the application of anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing requirements.28FATF, \\u201cFATF Report to G20 on So-called Stablecoins,\\u201d June 2020,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Virtualassets/Report-g20-so-called-stablecoins-june-2020.html.There is ongoing work needed to ensure consistent and effective implementation of FATF standards in the digital asset sphere, and some jurisdictions are still struggling with fulfilling the fundamental requirements outlined by FATF.International Organization of Securities CommissionsAs the leading international standard-setting body for securities regulation, IOSCO plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and efficiency of capital markets. With a growing interest in digital securities, IOSCO\\u2019s principles on issuer and investor protection, market integrity, and risk mitigation have significant implications for the global adoption of tokenized assets. IOSCO has more than 120 members, including national securities regulators and exchanges from various jurisdictions.29FATF,International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism & Proliferation: The FATF Recommendations, as amended November 2023,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Fatf-recommendations.html.While debates on which digital assets count as securities are ongoing in the United States, IOSCO has been actively engaged in providing insights into the realm of digital asset markets through a series of consultation reports and public reports.Policy Recommendations for Crypto and Digital Asset Markets, published in November 2023, stands out as a comprehensive consultation report proposing eighteen recommendations that address six key areas of concern. These areas include conflicts of interest resulting from vertical integration, market manipulation, cross-border risks, custody and client asset protection, operational and technological risks, and retail access, suitability, and distribution.30International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),Policy Recommendations for Crypto and Digital Asset Markets: Final Report, November 16, 2023,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD747.pdf.In March 2020, IOSCO releasedGlobal Stablecoin Initiatives, a public report emphasizing the applicability of principles for financial market infrastructures to stablecoin arrangements with systemically important functions. IOSCO\\u2019s work on exchange traded funds and crypto-asset trading platforms may also apply to global stablecoins.31IOSCO,Global Stablecoin Initiatives: Public Report, March 2020, PDF,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD650.pdf.In March 2022, IOSCO presented its public report on decentralized finance, highlighting regulatory concerns like fraud risks, flash loans, cybersecurity, and spillover effects on traditional markets. Additionally, in December 2020, the organization publishedInvestor Education on Crypto-Assets,a report to educate the public and investors on crypto assets and risk mitigation.32IOSCO,Investor Education on Crypto-Assets: Final Report, December 2020,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD668.pdf.Committee on Payments and Market InfrastructuresUnder the BIS, the CPMI provides a platform for central banks to promote the safety and efficiency of payment systems worldwide. With digital assets gaining recognition, the CPMI is actively engaging in discussions concerning the potential role of CBDCs and their interplay with private cryptocurrencies. The CPMI has twenty-eight members, representing major central banks and monetary authorities.A 2018 Markets Committee report titledCentral Bank Digital Currenciesintroduces and defines CBDCs, assessing their potential implications for monetary policy and central bank operations.33Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI),Central Bank Digital Currencies, CPMI Markets Committee, March 12, 2018,https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.htm\\u200b.It recommends further research on various aspects including interest rates, financial stability, and exchange rates. The report also warns against the risks of private digital tokens due to their volatility and lack of protection for investors and consumers, making them unsuitable for widespread use in payments.Financial Stability BoardThe FSB\\u2019s mandate is to oversee and coordinate global financial regulation, identifying and addressing systemic risks to foster stability in the financial system. Recognizing the growing importance of digital assets, the FSB monitors developments and potential risks arising from their use and ensures that the digital asset market operates within established stability parameters.34Financial Stability Board, \\u201cCrypto-assets and Global \\u2018Stablecoins,\\u2019 \\u201d n.d.,https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/financial-innovation-and-structural-change/crypto-assets-and-global-stablecoins/\\u200b\\u200b.The FSB is broadly focused on the global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities, and has not released any specific research or guidelines on CBDC development. The board\\u2019s membership includes a combination of G20 economies, other major economies, and international organizations.35Financial Stability Board, \\u201cCrypto-assets and Global \\u2018Stablecoins.\\u2019International Organization for StandardizationThe ISO fosters agreement on best practices and processes, and publishes standards and technical specifications (TS), including on the security aspects for digital currencies. ISO/TS 23526:2023 focuses on providing a security framework for the issuance and management of digital currencies in general, using cryptographic mechanisms standardized by ISO and other references. The document aims to integrate security aspects into the design of digital currency systems, as opposed to adding them later as an extra layer, to accommodate legacy infrastructures\\u200b.\\u200b36\\u201cISO/TS 23526:2021,\\u201d Online Browsing Platform, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), accessed November 26, 2023,https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:ts:23526:ed-1:v1:en.ISO does not have any explicit references or guidelines on CBDCs\\u2019 technical security, but instead has a broader focus on digital currencies overall.The following organizations below were added after the conference and depict wide-ranging efforts for interoperability occurring both in the private and public sector.Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial TelecommunicationBuilding on its legacy in global financial messaging, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) has introduced a model to enhance its existing infrastructure for cross-border payments, making them faster, more transparent, and cost-effective. Currently in beta testing, this model facilitates the connection of disparate national CBDC networks, enabling them to communicate and transact with one another while leveraging Swift\\u2019s existing infrastructure and security protocols\\u2014best thought of as a hub-and-spoke arrangement between various central banks with Swift at the center. This initiative is part of a broader Swift effort to prevent the fragmentation of the global payments landscape into \\u201cdigital islands.\\u201d37\\u201cSwift Advances CBDC Innovation as Interlinking Solution Begins Beta Testing,\\u201d Swift, September 13, 2023,https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-advances-cbdc-innovation-interlinking-solution-begins-beta-testing.The project began in March 2023, with over eighteen participants, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Banque de France. Within a twelve-week period, they were able to process over 5,000 transactions. In September 2023, Swift further broadened the initiative by announcing the participation of three new central banks: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Central Bank of Kazakhstan, and an additional, anonymous central bank.Following the insights and successes from Phase 1, Swift released the takeaways from the Phase II CBDC sandbox project in March 2024, engaging thirty-eight central banks, commercial banks, and market infrastructures from around the globe. This project was designed to tackle complex use cases and assess solutions within a controlled sandbox environment. The second phase involved over 125 participants, who collectively executed more than 750 transactions. The sandbox was hosted on Kaleido, a Web3 platform for blockchain applications, where central banks were able to simulate CBDC transactions. Swift\\u2019s technology stack included a combination of the Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, and Hyperledger Besu platforms.38\\u201cSwift Advances CBDC Innovation,\\u201d Swift.Phase II explored four new use cases. First, it demonstrated the automation of trade payments through CBDC networks and smart contracts, aiming to improve trade efficiency and minimize costs. Second, it evaluated two models for foreign exchange trade and settlement: an International Foreign Exchange Marketplace and a Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) inspired system, both of which underscored the integration of CBDC trade and settlement. Third, the project focused on delivery versus payment (DvP), facilitating atomic DvP for tokenized bonds by ensuring interoperability between tokenization platforms and CBDC networks. Finally, it investigated mechanisms to mitigate liquidity fragmentation across various currencies and platforms, utilizing smart contracts and netting algorithms. The report established three foundational principles for interoperability: linking networks via ISO 20022 messaging, providing a unified point of access through Swift, and ensuring coexistence with traditional market infrastructures.39\\u201cSwift Advances CBDC Innovation as Interlinking Solution Begins Beta Testing,\\u201d Swift, September 13, 2023,https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-advances-cbdc-innovation-interlinking-solution-begins-beta-testing.This model leverages Swift\\u2019s global reach and the existing network effects among financial institutions. It also offers flexibility for countries to maintain their own domestic CBDC infrastructure while ensuring global connectivity.The Internet Engineering Task ForceThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is deeply involved in the development of standards to enhance blockchain interoperability, focusing on the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP).40\\u201cSecure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP),\\u201d Internet Engineering Task Force, accessed April 6, 2024,https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/satp/about/.This protocol is designed to enable seamless transfers of digital assets across diverse distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) by leveraging a network of trusted gateways, akin to the role border gateway routers played in the early internet. Such an approach offers a scalable and ledger-agnostic solution for the rapidly evolving digital asset ecosystem.SATP facilitates asset transfers through a structured process that includes three main stages: Transfer Initiation, Lock-Evidence Verification, and Commitment Establishment. The protocol ensures that digital assets are exclusively valid within one network at any given time, adopting a transfer mechanism that maintains the asset\\u2019s integrity and uniqueness.41Andre Augusto, Rafael Belchior, Imre Kocsis, Laszlo Gonczy, Andre Vasconcelos, and Miguel Correia, \\u201cCBDC Bridging between Hyperledger Fabric and Permissioned EVM-based Blockchains,\\u201d paper presented at INESC-ID and Instituto Superior Tecnico, 2023,https://www.dpss.inesc-id.pt/~mpc/pubs/Augusto-CBDC-2023.pdf.This is achieved through the strategic use of gateway endpoints which manage the transfer process, ensuring secure, transparent, and auditable transactions that adhere to Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) principles.42Martin Hargreaves, Thomas Hardjono, and Rafael Belchior, \\u201cSecure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) Core,\\u201d draft-ietf-satp-core-04 (Internet-Draft), Internet Engineering Task Force, ,https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-satp-core/.The SATP framework comprises a comprehensive set of API endpoints and resources for the initiation and execution of asset transfers. It also aims to facilitate the integration and management of digital asset transactions, contributing to a more efficient and secure digital economy.Hyperledger, an open-source community focused on blockchain technologies, plays a role in implementing and advancing SATP through projects like Hyperledger Cacti.43\\u201cCacti, \\u201cHyperledger Foundation,https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/cacti.Cacti serves as a blockchain integration framework that enhances interoperability by allowing operations across multiple enterprise-grade blockchain networks. It achieves this through a pluggable architecture that supports Business Logic Plugins (BLP) and Ledger Connectors, enabling seamless interaction with various DLTs.Global Blockchain Business CouncilThe GBBC has launched the fourth iteration of the Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI 4.0), a comprehensive project designed to map and analyze the blockchain and digital assets landscape.44\\u201cGlobal Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI),\\u201d Global Blockchain Business Council,https://gbbcouncil.org/gsmi/.This initiative provides an extensive overview of regulatory developments across 230 jurisdictions and six global bodies, compiles a taxonomy of 350 terms and definitions, maps sixty-three technical standards bodies, and identifies more than 2,000 stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, it offers access to 1,500+ courses from accredited educational institutions and includes four in-depth reports focusing on AI convergence, digital identity, supply chain, and sustainability, with a special spotlight on Brazil. GSMI 4.0, building on the work since 2020, aims to present a holistic view of global industry activity. The initiative\\u2019s resources, including an interactive map of blockchain and digital asset regulations and a series of reports, are available on the GSMI site (https://gbbcouncil.org/gsmi/). All materials produced by the GSMI are crowd-sourced and open access, ensuring they serve as a reliable information source for those interested in blockchain and digital assets.The Internet Governance ForumThe Internet Governance Forum (IGF), primarily serves as a multistakeholder platform for policy dialogue on internet governance issues.45\\u201cAbout Us,\\u201d Internet Governance Forum, accessed March 1, 2024,https://www.intgovforum.org/en/about.While not directly implementing or proposing specific financial systems, the IGF\\u2019s contribution lies in facilitating discussions, building consensus, and sharing best practices among stakeholders to influence the governance frameworks that underpin these technologies. First convened in 2006 by the United Nations secretary-general as a result of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) held in 2003 and 2005, IGF gathers governments, the private sector, civil society, and technical communities to debate and share insights on enhancing internet security, ensuring digital privacy, fostering the digital economy, and expanding internet access.Security, trust, and privacy are central to the IGF\\u2019s discussions on digital financial services. The forum encourages dialogue on how to protect against fraud, ensure the integrity of digital transactions, and safeguard users\\u2019 privacy and data in an increasingly digital global economy. Key areas of focus for the IGF also include the development of governance frameworks that protect user data and ensure a secure online environment. The forum also emphasizes the importance of digital inclusion, advocating for equitable access to the internet and digital services across different regions and communities. Through its annual meetings and intersessional work, the IGF indirectly supports the infrastructure and policies that impact the digital economy and financial inclusivity.As the above section shows, there have been some efforts in creating standards for interoperability of digital assets. From feedback after the conference, we added the work of organizations such as Swift, IETF, GBBC, and IGF in standard creation. All the organizations listed above have led to important standard making efforts as described. However, these efforts are concentrated in specific areas and, as explored below, some crucial gaps exist that must be addressed in any evolving framework for standards.Lessons learned from standard-setting effortsAs we evaluate the above models of governance, it is important to assess growth opportunities for the next stage of standard developments. In this section, we identify the critical learnings and gaps in standards development for interoperability of digital assets.First, the rCBDC experimentation space has provided countries with some experience in building CBDCs, largely driven by domestic objectives. These experiments are at very different stages and use a range of private-sector vendors that are not subject to the same regulations due to a slower pace of crypto-asset regulation globally.Second, within wCBDC experimentation, operating frameworks in technology and regulation have emerged, led by entities like the BIS Innovation Hub, the global financial-messaging cooperative Swift, and other private-sector players. However, they are constrained by the limited number of participating countries, furthering the issue of fragmentation in cross-border CBDCs. Current experimentation should incorporate standards-setting bodies (SSBs) such as FSB, BCBS, CPMI, ISO, and FATF as participants or observers to ensure better collaboration in the development of standards.The membership structure of SSBs significantly influences the establishment of the goals and priorities of these institutions. Additionally, while emerging market economies often surpass developed economies in the development of digital infrastructure, including CBDCs, they sometimes find themselves underrepresented in setting norms and establishing benchmarks. This underrepresentation can result in an inadequate consideration of their technological advancements within the organization\\u2019s priorities.Moreover, apart from the FATF, there seems to be a shortage of robust frameworks for assessing the global standards\\u2019 impact and implementation lags. To address the evolving landscape of financial technologies, it is imperative that new and non-financial SSBs be actively involved in these discussions, leveraging their expertise in technological matters and regulatory concerns.Finally, some of the above frameworks have actively involved private sector participants in influencing standard development and creation. As intermediaries, the private sector has a crucial role in the entire lifecycle of standards, from actively influencing the creation of standards to ultimately adopting and implementing them.Towardsestablishing standardsA transparent and collaborative multi-stakeholder approach is crucial for establishing frameworks for standards related to digital currencies. Standardization is driven by consultation processes with governments, industry specialists, consumers, regulators, and civil society organizations (CSOs). Historically, governments have provided the necessary legal and governance paradigms, in turn creating environments conducive to standard development and assimilation across multi-stakeholder groups. Central banking authorities, driven by the imperative of maintaining financial stability and directing monetary policy, contribute a nuanced perspective essential for shaping these standards. The private sector\\u2019s technological advancements and practical exposure play a critical role, not just in ideation, but in the tangible implementation of these standards, ensuring their practical efficacy. Lastly, the participation of CSOs provides reflection and inclusion of key social elements, serving as a check by society on the suitability of resulting standards.The goal of this collaborative process is the establishment of a guiding framework for standards. To begin this process, we outlined the following themes for CBDC framework creation, which align with the G7 principles proposed in 2021, to identify the key themes necessary to begin building a framework. These key themes are governance; privacy and data protection; competition and consumer protection; global impact and sustainability; and transferability and accessibility. Through conversations at the conference and outreach afterward, we aimed to test the robustness of these themes through a survey (see Annex 2 for survey questions). Within each theme, we describe the areas of framework development needed for the establishment of standards. Conference attendees and survey respondents identified thematic overlaps and largely agreed with these themes, which have allowed us to set policy priorities for CBDC frameworks.A thematic approach to CBDC and digital asset standard creationGovernanceEffective governance of CBDCs requires a nuanced approach, placing a focus on maintaining public policy objectives and central bank mandates including monetary and financial stability. To achieve this, the framework should involve the creation of dynamic mechanisms that not only monitor, but also proactively mitigate potential destabilizing effects. Stress-testing frameworks are essential tools for central banks to assess the comprehensive impact of CBDCs on economic stability. The principle of \\u201cdo no harm\\u201d dictates that economic stability must be safeguarded at every stage of CBDC implementation, through concrete guidelines and risk assessments. In parallel, there is an imperative to establish legal and governance frameworks, offering clear definitions of regulatory benchmarks. Governance is the biggest challenge that emerges as we analyze existing efforts for standard setting, as each of the technical models discussed at the conference envisions an operator of an inherently global system. This is a complex and difficult endeavor, likely to have many challenges and phases.Privacy and Data ProtectionThe protection of privacy and data involves specifying requirements for user data protection, consent, and disclosures.46The Digital Dollar Project, Digital Dollar Foundation and Accenture.Mechanisms for cross-border data transfer should be designed to navigate the complexities of various data protection laws across jurisdictions, ensuring compliance, individual privacy protections, and seamless transactions. Operational resilience and cybersecurity require technology standards for resilience against cyber, fraud, and operational risks, including security measures, encryption standards, and incident response protocols.47J.

ElliottlinkedinfacebooktwitterbirdemailExecutive SummaryWhy Focus On The Future Of MoneyParadigms For A Changing Competitive LandscapeFrom Paradigms To SolutionsEmerging Use CasesAuthorsDownload ReportExecutive SummaryDecentralized finance (DeFi)Money is about to undergo fundamental changes in the way it is created and used, potentially unleashing a dramatic reordering of the financial system. While volatility has shaken cryptocurrency markets over the past year and caused a string of failures, many parts of the digital asset ecosystem continue to advance largely unaffected by the turmoil, as we explored in anearlier paper. These include the areas with the greatest long-term potential to transform finance, including the tokenization of financial assets and deposits and the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) by most of the world\\u2019s largest economies. The rise of digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) continues to have the potential to upend the competitive landscape, creating new, efficient, nimble competitors, but also offering incumbents a potential new lease on life. Executives and policymakers need to stay focused on the opportunities and risks associated with digital assets.The future of digital assets as a whole depends heavily on the future of digital money, as payments power the financial system. However, digital money could evolve in quite different ways; for example, there are different forms of digital money that could form the basis of new approaches, spanning CBDCs, tokenized deposits and different types of stablecoins. Executives and policymakers must think in terms of multiple scenarios rather than relying on a single prediction. These approaches will transform business models as they favor different types of issuers and their adoption will reshape liquidity, market-making, and risk management, which could impact the broader financial system considerably.To help industry executives and policymakers frame their thinking, this report presents four paradigms based on the issuers of money, the technology they choose, and the use cases they target. Traditional financial institutions could successfully evolve or be challenged by the rise of digital intermediaries. Alternatively, universal networks could transform financial markets and business models, or sovereigns could expand their control of money and change the role for the private sector and its business models.In a world of significantly higher interest rates, the economic value generated from facilitating payments could be bigger and even more contested. Establishing valuable commercial propositions will be crucial to scaling different forms of digital money. Their viability, in turn, will depend on the policy landscape, technological innovations, and the infrastructure design choices that money issuers make. Each factor will play a role in determining the winners.Policymakers and senior leaders in the financial industry, both incumbents and disruptors, should consider a range of plausible future scenarios, evaluate their potential impact, plan responses for the most likely developments, and consider how to bring about the most desirable outcomes. This process may play out quite differently across cross-border payments, asset settlement, and retail domestic payments. We will follow up in coming months with papers that focus on these specific digital money use cases.The Future ScenariosWhy Focus On The Future of MoneyTechnology has transformed the way we think about and use money from the first electronic payments in the telegraph era to the rise of mobile payments and cryptocurrencies. Today that process is poised to accelerate dramatically. Distributed ledger technology (DLT), such as blockchain, is inspiring the creation of new forms of money, from central bank digital currencies and tokenized deposits to stablecoins. These digital monies have the potential to make payments faster, cheaper, and more secure, and enable new economic activity and business models.This transformation of money will both fuel and be driven by a broader transformation of the financial system. DLT is enabling the creation of a broad array of assets, from digitized versions of traditional financial instruments such as stock and bonds and historically illiquid assets like art, real estate, and intellectual property, to digitally native vehicles that offer novel ways to transfer value. These assets can attract participation by a wider range of entities and investors, as well as change how they participate, fostering the rise of new financial products and business models.Digital assets and technology also will change the shape of financial services and markets. By presenting transactional and ownership information on a single, shared ledger, DLT enables participants to transact with one another without the involvement of traditional financial intermediaries. It enables the automation and coordination of transaction processes among multiple stakeholders, which will change the cost and distribution of financial products. This could spur new private networks that displace existing intermediaries and allow greater automation and integration across borders and asset classes. Alternatively, it could create new opportunities for banks, exchanges, custodians, and other institutions that embrace DLT and adapt their business models.Money is at the heart of these innovations. A thriving digital assets market requires a seamless way to trade these assets. A digitally native solution that embeds money in the same distributed framework as the assets themselves will maximize the speed and cost-effectiveness of payments, as well the connectivity to associated services such as collateral management and yield enhancement. Of course, such a solution needs to be trusted, reliable, sustainable, and secure.While digital assets have the potential to transform the way we store and exchange value, their success ultimately depends on whether they can be integrated with the existing financial system. Such an integration has the potential to enable faster and more secure transactions across the financial system. Payments could be settled instantly and safely, at any time of day, and at the same time assets are exchanged, a process known as atomic settlement. The financial system could change significantly as digital money impacts liquidity, market-making, and risk management given its speed and automation.Evolution of Forms of MoneySource: Adapted fromIt\\u2019s Time to Explore Institutional DeFiEstablishing valuable commercial propositions will be key to scaling up digital money, but the viability of those propositions will depend heavily on the policy landscape and technological innovations. Capital and liquidity requirements will have a major impact on the feasibility of commercial propositions, while the integration of digital money across borders can create the critical mass to power new business models. But both of those elements require a coordinated approach by national regulators, which is still in an early phase. At the same time, advances in technology will drive whether platforms can handle the volume of activity needed. New platforms also face the classic chicken-and-egg problem: how to start attracting consumers and producers when the economic value generated by facilitating payments to participants depends on high transaction volume.Key players are making critical investments and strategic decisions now that will shape the future. In a world of significantly higher interest rates, the economic value generated by facilitating payments could be bigger and even more contested. Executives need to start preparing for the ways in which digital money can transform the competitive landscape in which they operate. We present four paradigms to paint the corners for how this transformation might play out. The future of money will likely combine a mix of these different paradigms, and in potentially different proportions across various sectors and use cases. Industry leaders should prepare for thefuture by considering the full range of plausible scenarios.Paradigms For A Changing Competitive LandscapeThe future of money isn't preordained. A vast number of market participants are working to reshape that future. Blockchain and digital native startups are developing innovative products and services that have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. Incumbent institutions like banks are investing in new products, such as digital asset custody and settlement solutions. Fintech firms are already making significant inroads in transforming the way money moves globally. Big tech firms are also exploring the potential for their own digital currencies and payment systems, leveraging their massive user bases and data analytics capabilities. Central banks are researching the potential for digital currencies to complement traditional ones. Finally, regulators will play a critical role in shaping which commercial propositions are both viable and safe.The future of money and payments can take radically different directions depending on the forms of money that gain scale, the technology designs issuers choose and use cases they target, how incentives are incorporated, and whether the regulatory and policy environment is favorable, among other factors.Changes to money itself can have a profound impact on the financial system at large. To help industry executives and policymakers frame their thinking, we introduce four paradigms based on the types of institutions that could produce solutions that scale. These paradigms are meant to support scenario planning and are likely to coexist. They are not comprehensive and do not cover every possibility, such as a future in which cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin become a major part of the payments system.Four ParadigmsPARADIGM ONETraditional Finance EvolvesDigital assets support the continued centrality of banks and other financial institutionThis paradigm represents an evolution of the existing system, not a revolution, as banks and other incumbent financial institutions continue to dominate. (We will generally say \\u201cbanks\\u201d for short.) It assumes that banks largely evolve successfully, with digital money supporting their continued centrality to the financial system.For this paradigm to take hold, financial institutions need to demonstrate the commercial value of digital assets. Experimentation will lead to viable business models as banks become leading enablers for the new technologies, tokenizing both money and assets. Momentum could grow as solutions cascade across the system, from core activities like asset issuance and treasury to areas like merchant solutions and payments. Policymakers will be key enablers, providing regulatory space for innovation and potentially pushing new networks that reinforce banks\\u2019 position. This paradigm also will become more likely if regulation slows down digital natives or puts limits on potential commercial models.If banks can evolve successfully, they would thrive by ensuring their key economic and intermediation roles, pursuing new opportunities while providing balance sheet to support trading and lending activities in new infrastructures that lower their cost bases. Modernization of payments and trading could drive major efficiencies for clients by reducing liquidity needs, which would impact banking costs and revenues. This could increase market concentration as smaller players are squeezed out by margin pressure as well as the cost of adopting new infrastructure and the fight for talent. Even as banks evolve, institutions would continue to face strong competition for client relationships, including from big tech.PARADIGM TWOSovereign ExpansionCentral banks use CBDCs to gain share in payment flowsIn this paradigm, central banks would provide retail or wholesale users with CBDCs and use their instantaneous settlement capabilities to pick up a significant share of payment flows. Although central banks considering CBDCs are currently aiming to play a core role in payments without greatly disturbing the existing financial system, this paradigm assumes the process goes much further than current plans and does indeed transform the system.Radical change in the role of the central bank would require societal support. Individuals could come to prefer the features provided by retail CBDCs. Alternatively, demand could be driven by investors and institutions who want to ensure their digital money is fully backstopped by the central bank. This diversion of payment flows from private money to public could have a significant impact on bank business models, which would have to rely more on equity and wholesale funding rather than deposits.While the role of the private sector in money issuance might decrease, central banks might continue to partner with the private sector to distribute and maintain access to money. This could mean new opportunities and fee-based business models focused on the distribution and allocation of public money. Banks could find themselves in tough competition with payment service providers or new digital intermediaries. There could be an increased role for technology companies in providing payment services and infrastructure, as central bank money is integrated into mainstream payment systems.With public money having a greater role in the economy, central banks may then have more tools to enact and control monetary supply, as well as more real-time data. This paradigm could lead to greater financial stability as central banks gain more visibility and control over the money supply, but also create the potential for unintended consequences and new risks to emerge. Financial institutions would need to adjust their business models to account for the change in payment flows, particularly interms of their balance sheets and funding models.PARADIGM THREERise of Digital IntermediariesIn between evolution and revolutionThis paradigm sits somewhere between evolution and revolution, with digital natives gaining scale as the traditional financial industry struggles to adapt. Banking could be squeezed, with digital natives controlling customer access and expanding financial services provided.This paradigm can take shape if digital assets gain scale with intermediaries carving out key areas for differentiation. This could include a trusted digital money solution, with stablecoin issuers gaining scale, or efficient and compliant market infrastructure solutions, such as cryptocurrency exchanges concentrating liquidity. To capture institutional flow, digital intermediaries will need regulatory acceptance of their business models. Profitability of digital natives would enable them to launch compelling new services across financial services, including lending, origination, and liquidity provision, while traditional finance players work to overcome legacy technology, culture, and regulatory obstacles. Integration across services could be established through cooperation across the value chain, or itself become a way for new digital intermediaries to emerge that provide the range of services.Powerful new companies could emerge that operate globally and squeeze other financial institutions out of client relationships, potentially starting with younger, early adopters. As a result, competition between financial services providers would start to move from control of operating accounts to custody, as money increasingly moves into stablecoins held in digital wallets. This suggests banks and financial market infrastructure firms would be hit by multiple pressures, including loss of business, pressure to pivot business models, and costs to accelerate digital asset capabilities. Beyond banks, competition between digital natives could also accelerate and would likely include the entry of big tech players. Smaller proprietary networks might push for interoperability to ensure continued relevance.PARADIGM FOURUniversal NetworksRevolution \\u2013 the financial system as we knowit is transformedThis is the most radical paradigm, one that would strongly transform the financial system. The rise of new open networks would enable borrowers and lenders, issuers and investors, and other market participants to deal directly, without intermediaries. Transactions would be powered and governed by smart contracts and institutional decentralized finance protocols. The trend toward capital market-based financing would be accelerated by algorithmic creation and allocation of credit over highly integrated networks. This could disrupt the business models of banks and today's digital natives.Radical change would require high levels of support. Policymakers could become more comfortable with this paradigm if there are trusted solutions to compliance and safeguards in existing networks. Alternatively, supranational organizations could enable cross-country collaboration for new platforms, such as the Bank for International Settlements\\u2019 (BIS) vision for a unified global ledger or the International Monetary Fund\\u2019s (IMF) proposal for a multi-currency marketplace. It\\u2019s also possible that trust is built over time through experimentation with new policy tools. The European Commission, for example, put out a tender for a study on embedded supervision of decentralized finance. Networks that are truly universal will also depend on convergence around shared standards, as well as continued advances in technology that enable both scale and trust.This paradigm would imply greater participation and expansion of capital markets, but participation models could change dramatically as users and investors are connected by automation instead of intermediaries. This would require financial services providers (or new types of organizations) making using of automation to also expand risk management capabilities and successfully build incentive models. If users can control their data and wallets, that could encourage new services that blur the lines between banking and commerce, enabling financial activities to become embedded and seamless. With the growth and expansion of market-based financing, investors and firms alike would need to become more sophisticated about risk management.From Paradigms To SolutionsParticipants are already planting the seeds of these various paradigms. Policymakers are taking decisions and companies are exploring commercial propositions that will determine which forms of money are viable. The networks where digital money is issued and gains scale will define who is in the running to offer new services. These seeds won\\u2019t sprout overnight but senior executives need to start preparing now. Money has network effects and digital money could scale at a rapid pace.Contesting Forms of Digital MoneyCompeting forms of moneyCompeting forms of money will feature different business models and economics for their issuers and will need to win the trust of users that nominal value can be maintained. Generally, issuers make a profit by earning an interest margin on the assets backing the money and by collecting fees on payments, transactions, and bundled services, while ensuring trust by appropriately backing the issuance. In a world of higher interest rates, the economic value generated from facilitating payments becomes more attractive.Central bank digital currenciesare a digital form of central bank liability.Many central banks are exploring CBDCs to ensure the money they issue continues as an anchor of value in an increasingly digital world. A retail CBDC would serve as a modern version of paper currency or coins: made available to all individuals but digitally native and more similar in experience to a bank account, with similar levels of data access by authorities. Several major economies are expected to launch retail CBDCs within the next five years, including China (which has been working on a digital yuan project since 2014), India, and the European Union. An expansive retail CBDC could divert deposits from the banking system, increase bank funding costs, and reduce bank interest income, which explains why many banks oppose the idea. Some central banks are looking to cap the amount an individual or firm may hold in CBDCs and ensure they seamlessly integrate with deposits, which could favor banks. On the other hand, CBDCs might create new fee-based income opportunities for payment service providers that partner in distribution, favoring new digital intermediaries.A wholesale CBDC is a modern version of reserves issued on new central bank platforms to help financial institutions, not consumers, transact more efficiently with each other. Countries are exploring them mainly for cross-border payments and to settle asset transactions. By speeding up wholesale payments, they would reduce the need for banks and corporations to tie up liquidity for two or more days. A wholesale CBDC would retain the two-tier structure of today\\u2019s financial system, whereby central bank money underpins private money creation by commercial banks and others. The paradigm it favors will depend on which types of institutions have access to wholesale CBDCs.Tokenized depositsare a digital form of a bank deposit issued by a regulated institution.They are recorded on a distributed ledger and intended to settle trades of tokenized real-world assets or other digital assets. Tokenized deposits could take on different forms, whether account or token-based. Financial institutions and central banks have only recently begun experimenting with these instruments, and many issues remain to be resolved in both regulation and business models. For example, from a regulatory perspective, it\\u2019s not clear how capital and liquidity requirements might need to evolve if tokenized deposits lead to different behaviors and usage. It\\u2019s also not clear how deposits from different institutions will be made interchangeable and whether new business models will emerge to solve for that.Issuing tokenized deposits would favor banks\\u2019 economic position by helping to secure their funding, which has traditionally relied on customer deposits, and providing a currency for participating in the digital asset sector. This could be a key driver for traditional finance to evolve successfully.Fiat-backed stablecoinsdigital assets designed to maintain a stable value against a national currency, such as the US dollar, backed by assets denominated in that currency.These instruments play a major role in crypto markets, with more than $7 trillion in transactions executed in 2022, and issuers are exploring their use for real-world payments. Most stablecoins do not pay interest, unlike deposits, which can provide significant value to issuers in a rising interest rate environment. They also generate fee income from transaction and treasury services that scale up with volume growth. Digital natives dominate the stablecoin market and they could develop powerful new intermediary roles as the use of these coins proliferates. Financial institutions have recently begun to issue their own stablecoins.Stablecoin growth will require coherent regulation, and potentially adjustments to existing business models. Maintaining a peg against the dollar or other currency depends both on appropriate reserves to manage normal outflows as well as access to backstops in the case of systemic events. The importance of maintaining a peg was highlighted by recent contagion events in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, where concerns around traditional finance deposits spread to crypto markets. Stablecoin regulation has evolved at a different rate across the globe. For example, the European Union\\u2019s new Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) regulation mandates that issuers hold reserves to back their coins; however, the United States might take years to develop comparable rules, given the need for legislation from a divided Congress.Decentralized stablecoinsare private sector-issued digital assets designed to maintain a stable value while backed by other digital assets.These represent a small fraction of total stablecoin transactions and their regulatory path is not as clear as fiat-backed stablecoins, especially given their reliance on decentralized governance. After the Terra/Luna collapse of 2022, coins relying on algorithms to maintain a peg have lost favor to designs based on overcollateralization. These stablecoins generate interest income from overcollateralized reserves, as well as fees from executing trades and collateral liquidation from margin calls.While a small fraction of current market activity, decentralized stablecoins could represent the frontier of innovation, making use of smart contracts and new governance designs to manage their balance sheets and distribute the economic value from issuance.These options are not exhaustive. The ease of swapping different digital assets through smart contracts means a wider variety of tokens can function like money to exchange value in a transaction. This can blur the lines between money and assets, enabling new business models while also creating new policy challenges. For example, funds kept with traditional money market funds need to be withdrawn to be used in payments, but this could change if money market fund tokens are recognized as means of payment in smart contracts or networks.Competing market infrastructure designsMarket infrastructure design and participation is becoming a key strategic and policy issue. In the traditional financial system, money and assets exist on separate networks, where banks have a privileged role in helping settle transactions. DLT-inspired technologies could upend this system and disintermediate banks. The more integrated and universal the network \\u2013 that is, the greater diversity of assets and stakeholders that a distributed network contains \\u2013 the higher the likelihood that new business models could emerge and disrupt banks.Because there are significant network benefits with digital money and assets, market infrastructures that are early in gaining scale might later be hard to disrupt. A variety of network designs have emerged, ranging from open, permissionless networks that defy national borders to tightly controlled ones, each one with different economics. Senior executives should understand the motivation, opportunities, and challenges for each design.Closed (permissioned) networksimpose limitations on who can access and manage the network. Financial institutions have used this option in digital asset experiments because it aligns closely with their existing business model as regulated providers of financial services. It also has greater policy support given the greater level of control and the ability to rely on existing approaches to manage risk and compliance. For example, the BIS advocates this approach in its vision of a unified global ledger.This type of network could be the least disruptive to the financial industry, while also leading to a reshuffling within the industry if some banks are slow to adapt. However, if only a few banks and participants join, it could make it harder for any network to scale up and develop a rich digital assets ecosystem.By contrast, inopen (permissionless) networks, participation is limited only by economic realities. This is the approach used by most crypto networks today. Given the challenges with enforcing compliance and regulation when there are no restrictions on access and usage, many in the industry are looking to build a \\u201ctrust layer\\u201d to ensure transactions take place only among verified participants. Banks that have issued digital bonds and stablecoins on public networks have followed this approach. Project Guardian by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was an example of experimentation by the public sector. As discussed inour paper on the project, broader industry efforts are needed to scale this solution, including the creation of legal clarity, standards, and guardrails. A trust layer could enable digital natives to launchinnovative new services in lending, origination, and financing in a manner that gains policy support.Emerging Use CasesThe future of money is highly unlikely to be monochrome, with every sector adopting the same instruments, technology designs, and business models. Instead, it will grow use case by use case, driven by preferences and decisions made across business segments and geographies. The future will likely combine elements of some or all of the four paradigms. Here, we look at how these factors might play out among some of the most likely competitors across three major use cases \\u2013 cross-border payments, asset settlement, and domestic retail payments.Cross-border paymentsSending money from one country to another can be a costly and prolonged process.Our joint papershowed that corporates move more than $23 trillion across borders each year and incur roughly $120 billion in transaction costs. A common digital platform linking national CBDCs to enable real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments could slash corporate transaction costs by more than 80%, or $100 billion a year.Over 30 countries have already started experimenting with using CBDCs for cross-border payments. In a pilot project with the BIS, the central banks of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates showed that digital ledger technology could execute trades between the four parties\\u2019 digital currencies in seconds and reduce costs as much as 50% by cutting out correspondent banks and streamlining liquidity management. Meanwhile, new market infrastructures and business models are emerging. Banks have launched consortia that use blockchain technology for multi-currency FX net settlement and for payment-versus-payment capability. New stablecoins are emerging pegged to new currencies, with MiCA providing regulatory clarity for euro-pegged stablecoins. The cross-border opportunity is vast but the challenge facing all innovators is the need for coordination, harmonization, and interoperability between so many jurisdictions and technology platforms.Asset settlementTraditional asset settlement, while largely electronic, is still costly, time-consuming, and complicated. Processes are fragmented by asset classes and jurisdictions, with limited standardization. Digital money could introduce some greater efficiencies, but it would require the widespread tokenization of a range of assets to reap the full benefits of settling trades in CBDCs or stablecoins or tokenized deposits. We are far from that point, with total digital bond issuance amounting to just $1.5 billion currently, a tiny fraction of the $127 trillion global fixed-income market.Digital payment solutions could enable a variety of technology firms to compete with global custodians that have traditionally dominated this space. Institutional DeFi protocols can automate financial transactions and provide a more decentralized and secure way of settling assets and automating risk-management practices. Real-time settlement based on delivery versus payment can reduce the risk of counterparty default and free up capital for other purposes. Banks, custodians, and other traditional intermediaries will need to adapt quickly to harness these changes. Estimates on the expected size of tokenized asset markets vary widely, but there could be reinforcing benefits to redesigning both asset forms and the money that\\u2019s used to settle transactions, which would accelerate the rate of change.Retail domestic paymentsCentral bank digital currencies will be a big wild card in retail payments, with roughly 100 jurisdictions around the world exploring the issuance of CBDCs or having already done so. Few CBDC projects make use of DLT, while many leave the development of new payment features to the private sector. This could unleash competition between the firms that dominate payments today and blockchain-native innovators offering new value-added services based on programmable smart contracts or loyalty features like rewards programs. Stablecoin issuers are already looking to apply their technology to real-world retail payments. Open infrastructures that allow users to exercise more control over their data, an integral part of web3 ecosystems, could gain favor with consumers.The paradigms presented in this paper can help banks, businesses, and policymakers as they consider their next steps, but they aren\\u2019t mutually exclusive.We are likely to see some if not all of these types of money coexist and play a growing role, depending on whether they are being used for retail transactions at the corner store or to finance multi-billion-dollar cross-border trade deals or investments. In subsequent papers, we will explore these different use cases in much more detail, and we will examine how the paradigms could play out under different scenarios and what industry leaders should be doingtoday.AuthorsLarissa de Lima,Jason EkbergandDouglas J.

Unlike traditional money,CBDCsoffer a digital alternative that is both backed and issued by national central banks, combining the benefits of digital transactions with the stability of government-backed currency. Understanding the depth and breadth ofCBDCsis crucial for financial experts navigating the future of finance.The Evolution of Money and Introduction of CBDCsMoney has seen significant transformations over the centuries, evolving from barter systems to banknotes and now to digital banking.CBDCsrepresent the next step, aiming to modernize financial services to be more resilient and inclusive. Central banks like theEuropean Central Bankand theFederal Reserveare exploringCBDCsto stay at the forefront of technological innovation while safeguarding monetary sovereignty.Technological UnderpinningsCBDCsare digital currencies issued by central banks that hold legal tender status, bridging the gap between digital and physical economies. While some countries opt for blockchain technology to leverage decentralization, transparency, and security, others prefer a centralized approach to maintain tighter control. Key technological considerations forCBDCsinclude:Scalability:Ensuring the system can handle large volumes of transactions.Security:Implementing robust defenses against cyber threats and fraud.Interoperability:Facilitating seamless integration with existing financial technologies.Privacy:Balancing transparency with individual rights to privacy.Worldwide Implementation EffortsDifferent nations have taken unique approaches to deployingCBDCs, reflecting their diverse economic contexts and objectives:Sweden\\u2019s E-krona:Developed in response to dwindling cash usage, aiming to secure public access to trusted money in a digital format.China\\u2019s Digital Yuan:Part of a broader initiative to increase China\\u2019s influence in the global financial system.Eastern Caribbean\\u2019s DCash:Implemented to improve financial accessibility and resilience in a region prone to natural disasters.Advantages of CBDCsCBDCsoffer numerous advantages, including:Efficiency:Streamlining payments and settlements, enhancing economic activity and reducing transaction costs.Financial Inclusion:Providing a gateway for financial services to populations typically outside the banking system.Reduced Operational Costs:Digital formats decrease costs related to printing, distributing, and securing physical currency.Monetary Sovereignty:Helping countries assert control over their monetary systems.Stability:Offering a secure alternative to private digital currencies and volatile cryptocurrencies.Economic and Market ImplicationsThe implementation ofCBDCscould significantly impact monetary policy and financial stability. By providing central banks with a new tool for conducting monetary policy,CBDCscould enhance control over the money supply and interest rates. They may also influence the banking system by providing individuals with direct access to the central bank\\u2019s resources, potentially reducing transaction costs and increasing speed.CBDCscarry significant implications for the global financial marketplace, including:Banking Sector Dynamics:With the potential to hold funds directly with the central bank, consumers might chooseCBDCsover traditional bank deposits.International Trade:Facilitating easier and cheaper cross-border transactions, potentially reshaping economic engagement.Innovation and Competition:Spurring innovation within the private sector, pushing financial institutions to enhance their service offerings.Despite the potential benefits,CBDCsraise significant issues, particularly regarding privacy and data security. Ensuring aCBDCsystem is secure against cyberattacks while maintaining user privacy is a complex challenge.Regulatory and Policy FrameworksThe successful rollout ofCBDCswill require comprehensiveregulatory frameworksto address potential risks and ensure smooth operation. These frameworks need to tackle issues related to cybersecurity, privacy, legal tender status, and international cooperation.\\n\\nAs digital currencies become more integrated into the global financial system, they may offer a more inclusive and efficient financial framework but will require careful implementation to balance innovation with stability.CBDCspresent a profound opportunity to enhance financial transactions, promoting greater efficiency, inclusivity, and stability. However, their successful integration demands careful consideration of technological choices, impact assessments on existing financial structures, and robust regulatory measures.The information provided here is not investment, tax, or financial advice.

According to the latest data from Money\\u2019s daily rate survey, borrowers seeking a30-year fixed-rate purchase loanfound rates averaging6.711%. Meanwhile, the30-year refinance rateis averaging slightly higher at6.814%.Freddie Mac reported a notable rise in the average rate for a30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which jumped to6.32%, marking an increase of0.20 percentage pointsfrom the previous week. Similarly, the15-year fixed-rate mortgagesaw an uptick, averaging5.41%, with a0.16 percentage pointincrease.Despite these increases,mortgage ratesremain nearly a full percentage point lower than the year\\u2019s high of7.22%. This trend reflects the largest week-over-week increase since last April. In a press release, Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\\u2019s chief economist, emphasized that while higher rates present challenges for prospective buyers, the underlying strength of the U.S. economy \\u201cshould continue to support the recovery of the housing market.\\u201dFor those navigating thecurrent mortgage landscape, it\\u2019s crucial to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders. Money\\u2019s list of theBest Mortgage Lendersand theBest Mortgage Refinance Companiescan provide a starting point for finding competitive rates. Additionally, utilizing Money\\u2019smortgage calculatorcan help borrowers estimate their monthly payments under different rate scenarios.Understanding Mortgage Rate TrendsThe recent rise inmortgage ratesis partly attributed to last week\\u2019s better-than-expected jobs report, which sent yields on10-year Treasury bondshigher, subsequently pulling mortgage rates up as well. As more economic data emerges, prospective buyers should brace for continued volatility in the near term.When consideringmortgage options, it\\u2019s essential to understand the differences betweenfixed-rateandadjustable-rate mortgages. Fixed-rate loans offer stability with a consistent interest rate throughout the loan\\u2019s duration, while adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) begin with a fixed rate that later adjusts at regular intervals.Factors Influencing Mortgage RatesLoan Term:Longer loans typically have smaller payments but may cost more overall.Loan Type:Fixed-rate loans offer steady payments, while ARMs adjust periodically.Economic Factors:Rates are influenced by the federal funds rate, Treasury yields, and borrower qualifications.For those contemplating refinancing, it\\u2019s crucial to weigh the pros and cons, asrefinance ratestend to be higher. Resources like theIs Now a Good Time to Refinanceguide can help homeowners make informed decisions.Securing the Best Mortgage RateTo secure thebest mortgage rate, shopping around is key. Freddie Mac suggests that obtaining rate quotes from multiple lenders can lead to significant savings over the life of the loan. Additionally, buyingdiscount pointscan lower the interest rate, offering further savings. More details on this can be found in theDiscount Pointsguide.For those with higher-than-average rates, improving credit scores and exploring multiple lender options can help lower offers.

Here\\u2019s a detailed look at the anticipated trends and changes.2025 ForecastThehousing market in 2025is expected to see a slight rise inhome prices, projected to be between 1% and 2% above current inflation rates. This growth is anticipated due to increased real incomes and lower mortgage rates, which will enhance affordability. As millennials reach their prime home-buying age, demand is expected to rise, with new constructions attempting to mitigate the ongoing inventory shortage. Despite improvements, underbuilding will continue to affect market dynamics.2026 OutlookIn 2026, more buyers are likely to collaborate with family and friends to manage high housing costs. Emerging technologies are set to revolutionizehome construction, making it faster and more cost-efficient. Builders will be urged to consider the rising costs associated withclimate change, focusing on sustainability and resilience in new developments.2027 ExpectationsLooking towards 2027, demographic trends such as urbanization and shifts in worker preferences due to remote work will influencemarket demand. Interest rates are expected to stabilize, potentially settling between 5.5% and 7%, impactingmortgage affordability. An increase in housing demand in suburban and rural areas is anticipated as people seek more space and community amenities.2028 ProjectionsBy 2028, the rise inhousing inventorymay return the market to a more balanced state, with supply meeting demand. This balance could ease competition in local markets, particularly in fast-growing Southern cities. However,housing affordabilitywill continue to pose challenges, especially in densely populated urban centers.2029 VisionApproaching 2029, gradual changes in economic conditions, technological advances, and demographic shifts are expected to shape thehousing landscape. As Millennials and Gen Z dominate the buying market, preferences will shift towards environmentally friendly, affordable housing solutions.

These laws, approved by Governor Ron DeSantis, are designed to enhance affordability and protection for residents, touching on various aspects of the real estate industry.Boosting Housing ProgramsAt the forefront is theHometown Heroes Housing Program (SB 328), which sees an additional $100 million allocated to aid first-time homebuyers, particularly those in essential service roles such as teachers and healthcare workers. This initiative aligns with previous efforts to stimulate private investment in affordable housing, providing necessary guidance on local zoning and density regulations. Realtors are encouraged to direct clients to theHometown Heroes Program.In a similar vein, theMy Safe Florida Home Program (SB 7028)receives a $200 million boost, aimed at empowering homeowners to fortify their homes against severe weather, thereby reducing insurance costs. The program now includes free inspections and grants up to $10,000 for low-income homeowners without the need for matching funds. More details can be foundhere.Expanding Protection to CondosTheMy Safe Florida Condominium Pilot Program (HB 1029)extends these protective measures to coastal condominiums, with $30 million dedicated to strengthening roofs and openings against storms.

These measures aim to alleviate financial pressures on homeowners.Environmental efforts are bolstered with over $1.2 billion allocated for water quality initiatives, including Everglades restoration and mitigation of harmful algal blooms.Looking AheadFuture legislation includes increased transparency in condominium and homeowners\\u2019 association documents, with requirements for digital accessibility. Upcoming laws will also mandate seller flood disclosures and digital record-keeping for homeowner associations, with phased implementation over the next few years.These legislative changes, as highlighted in theoriginal article, reflect a proactive approach by Florida\\u2019s legislative assembly and Florida Realtors to address critical housing and environmental issues, promising widespread benefits for Floridians.Read More1310, 2024Opportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesGalleryOpportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesArticle,Housing Market,Mortgage RatesOpportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-13T23:48:49-04:00October 13, 2024|Categories:Article,Housing Market,Mortgage Rates|Tags:Home Buying,Real Estate|0 CommentsAfter weeks of steady declines,mortgage rateshave finally reached a range that brings the dream of homeownership closer for many hopeful buyers. This shift suggests potential relief in the inflated housing market, offering buyers increased purchasing power despite ongoing high home prices. Experts indicate that the current conditions could favor those looking to enter the housing market before potential demand surges occur once again.Although home prices continue to break records, price growth is slowing due to loosening inventory and sluggish demand. Buyers are gaining leverage when negotiating with sellers, creating a window of opportunity for those ready to make a move.Despite the positive trend inmortgage rates, many potential buyers remain cautious, waiting for further Federal Reserve rate cuts that could lead to even lower mortgage rates. However, experts warn that waiting too long could result in missing out on favorable market conditions. Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, suggests that lower rates this fall could coincide with slower home price growth as more sellers enter the market and inventory rises.Housing Market Forecast for 2024 and 2025The U.S. housing market continues to be a hot topic, withhome pricesposting a 5% annual gain according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index. While this is a slowdown from June\\u2019s 5.5% gain, home prices remain at record highs, making affordability a challenge for many.Ralph McLaughlin, senior economist at Realtor.com, echoes the sentiment that home price growth will slow before rebounding. He notes that withmortgage ratesfalling to 24-month lows and a high probability of further rate reductions, home price growth could bottom out before reaccelerating as buyer purchasing power improves.Can We Expect a Housing Market Recovery in 2025?For a housing recovery to take place, several conditions need to unfold. Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH.com, suggests that inventories of homes for sale must increase significantly to ease upward pressure on prices. The recent decline inmortgage ratesis beginning to help loosen inventory, albeit gradually.After peaking at 7.79% in October 2023, the average 30-year fixedmortgage ratehas been below 6.5% since mid-August, landing at 6.12% the week ending October 3. This trend, coupled with the Federal Reserve\\u2019s recent rate cut, offers a glimmer of hope for potential buyers.NAR Practice Changes: What Buyers and Sellers Need To KnowIn a landmark settlement, theNational Association of Realtors (NAR)agreed to pay $418 million to settle antitrust lawsuits, leading to new rules that promote a more transparent home-buying process. These changes, effective since August 17, aim to benefit both consumers and agents by clarifying the financial aspects of real estate transactions.For decades, it was standard practice for home sellers to cover the buyer\\u2019s broker commission, but now buyers must enter into written agreements with agents before touring homes. Buyers can negotiate commission payments, adding a new layer of complexity to the transaction process.How Will the New Rules Impact Affordability?With buyers more likely to be responsible for paying broker commissions, affordability concerns arise. Matt Side from Realty ONE Group Eclipse notes that buyers with fewer resources could be particularly affected. However, he advises that sellers will continue to offer compensation to buyer representatives to increase demand for their homes.Housing Inventory Forecast: When Will There Be Sufficient Supply To Reduce Prices?Despite more resale and new homes entering the market, inventory remains well below pre-Covid averages. Many homeowners are \\u201clocked in\\u201d at ultra-low mortgage rates, unwilling to exchange for higher rates in a high-priced market, leading to demand outpacing supply.Rick Sharga, founder and CEO of CJ Patrick Company, suggests that a meaningful increase in supply won\\u2019t occur untilmortgage ratesreturn to the low 5% range, likely not in 2024. However, declining rates could loosen the lock-in effect, providing some much-needed housing supply.Will the Housing Market Crash in 2025?Concerns about a housing market crash akin to 2008 are prevalent, but experts like Tom Hutchens from Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions believe the record-low supply of houses protects against such a scenario. Today\\u2019s homeowners are on more secure footing, with many having substantial home equity.Jess Schulman from Bluebird Lending agrees, noting that further Fed rate cuts could lead to more transactions and potential home price increases due to pent-up demand.Will 2024 or 2025 Be Better to Buy a Home?Buying a house is a highly personal decision, and while predicting future market conditions is challenging, experts advise against waiting for the perfect moment. Orphe Divounguy from Zillow Home Loans suggests that the best time to buy is when you find a home that meets your needs and budget.Keith Gumbinger concurs, warning that waiting for better conditions may not be the best strategy, as home prices generally keep rising, moving the goalposts for amassing a down payment.In conclusion, while the housing market presents challenges, there are opportunities for those ready to navigate the complexities. Asmortgage ratesdecline and home prices stabilize, potential buyers and sellers must stay informed and prepared to make the most of the evolving landscape.Read More1310, 2024The $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkGalleryThe $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkArticle,Real Estate,Remote WorkThe $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-13T22:48:34-04:00October 13, 2024|Categories:Article,Real Estate,Remote Work|Tags:housing market,Secondary Cities|0 CommentsIn the ever-evolving landscape ofreal estate, the nationalhousing markethas reached a staggering valuation of $47.5 trillion, marking a $2.4 trillion increase over the past year. This remarkable growth, as highlighted in apreliminary Redfin analysis, underscores the profound impact ofremote workon housing trends.Remote Work and Secondary CitiesA key driver of this surge is the allure ofremote work, which has reshaped the demand for housing in specific metropolitan areas. More affordable cities, often referred to as \\u201csecondary cities,\\u201d have emerged as significant beneficiaries. For instance, Newark, New Jersey, and New Haven, Connecticut, experienced notable increases in home values, with Newark\\u2019shousing marketskyrocketing by 12.8% over the last year. This trend is largely due to their proximity to larger urban centers and their appeal to those priced out of expensive metros like New York.The Subcity PhenomenonThe concept of a \\u201csubcity,\\u201d as described in acolloquial definition, plays a crucial role in this dynamic. These are cities that function as secondary hubs to larger metropolitan areas. With theremote worktrend solidifying into a hybrid model, thesesubcitieshave become attractive alternatives, offering affordability and accessibility.Winners and Losers in the Housing MarketWhilesecondary citiesflourish, traditional boomtowns and high-cost areas have faced stagnation or decline. Cities like Boise, Idaho, and New York City saw declines in home values, attributed to their already high prices or pandemic-fueled influxes that have since waned. Meanwhile, suburban and rural areas have also seen growth, with suburban home values rising by 5.6% to about $29 trillion.Challenges for Prospective BuyersDespite the overall market growth, prospective buyers face significant challenges. Elevated mortgage rates, limited inventory, and high home prices have made homeownership increasingly unaffordable. Asreported by Fortune, thehousing marketexperienced a freeze, with existing home sales plummeting to their lowest point in nearly three decades.However, there is a silver lining. Experts anticipate that mortgage rates may start to decline before the end of 2024, potentially easing affordability concerns. Until then, homeowners continue to hold substantial housing wealth, benefiting from the supply shortage that maintains elevated home values.ConclusionAs thehousing marketcontinues to evolve, the interplay betweenremote work,secondary cities, and economic factors will remain pivotal.

If the trend of declining high inflation continues, it could align with the Federal Reserve\\u2019s targets, leading to reduced volatility in mortgage rates.

This increase will be driven by factors such as the rise in real incomes, lower mortgage rates, and increased affordability. However, it may take time to reach the home value heights of mid-2022.The trend of buyers pooling resources with friends and family to purchase homes is expected to continue, as the rising cost of housing drives people to seek more space and privacy.

According toEducationData.org\\u2019s 2023 report, the average federal student loan borrower owes $37,574, while private borrowers face an even steeper average of $54,921. With these daunting figures, many are considering unconventional methods to ease their financial burden.Contact Your LenderFor those with private loans, reaching out to your lender can reveal whether credit card payments are an option. While not all lenders offer this flexibility, some do, providing a possible avenue for managing payments more conveniently.Utilize Third-Party Payment PlatformsFederal student loan borrowers might consider third-party platforms likePaySimplyandPlastiq. These services enable payments via credit card by converting them into wire transfers or cash equivalents, although fees ranging from 2.5% to 3% can offset any potential rewards benefits.Consider a Balance TransferFor those nearing the end of their loan term, transferring the balance to a0% APR balance transfer credit cardcould be a viable option. This method can provide an interest-free period of up to 21 months, though it comes with a transfer fee of 2% to 3%.Creative BudgetingA strategic approach involves reallocating expenses. For example, paying for groceries with a credit card can free up cash for student loan payments, achieving the same financial effect without direct loan charges.Cash AdvancesWhile not ideal due to highAPRrates and immediate interest accrual, cash advances can be a last-resort option. Borrowers should weigh the costs carefully before proceeding.Explore Deferment and ForbearanceFederal loan holders should exploredeferment and forbearanceoptions, which offer payment relief without credit damage. Private lenders may also provide hardship plans, though these vary by institution.While these strategies can provide temporary relief, borrowers must remain vigilant about the potential pitfalls, such as high interest rates and the risk of accumulating more debt.

As part of this exploration, central banks are carefully considering the feasibility of retail CBDCs[2]References to CBDCs in this paper are referring to retail CBDCs unless otherwise specified.as they continually strive to strengthen and grow their economies with greater innovation and efficiency. To do this, they will necessarily have to engage an ecosystem of participating banks, payment service providers, data service providers, payment networks, and a variety of technology resources. Collectively, it will be critical that there is active public-private collaboration to consider the impact that CBDCs may have on the future of payments and how best to safeguard the interests of consumers and businesses.Exploring the promise of new technology and the potential efficiency gains that adoption could bring has been an essential part of the modernisation journey. Innovative new solutions have been the drivers for sustainable and inclusive economic growth that benefit everyone, everywhere. However, the success of innovative payment solutions has always been contingent on whether they fundamentally address any perceived gaps in the market that existing solutions and services do not already adequately serve. It also depends on whether consumers and businesses believe that new payment innovations are superior to the (digital) solutions already available.Importantly in case of CBDCs, it will also be contingent on who is best placed to provide this innovation. Unlike commercial payment solutions offered today, retail CBDCs raise the more fundamental questions of whether central banks should be in the business of providing retail payments to customers and the broader implications this may have on competition. There are also problematic assumptions made in relation to retail CBDCs that relate to their need to mimic cash-like convenience, which has a direct impact on business models, distorting market dynamics and risking instability.This paper challenges the motivations and the assumptions made by central banks on how retail CBDCs would be delivered under so-called \\u201ctwo-tier\\u201d intermediated models. Section 1 explores the motivations outlined by central banks, and questions whether retail CBDCs are intended to act as \\u201cmonetary anchors\\u201d for stability or, whether they are instead being designed as central bank-led market solutions. Section 2 then discusses the notion that a retail CBDC would be delivered under a two-tier intermediated model, highlighting the vast gaps between how the roles of industry participants for retail CBDCs are envisaged and how the current intermediated financial system operates today. Section 3 then delves into the commercial model for delivering a retail CBDC, which for many central banks, is expected to be offered free of charge to customers just like their cash equivalents. The paper concludes with the principles that will be needed for CBDCs to successfully address user needs, and importantly how the market can help deliver and distribute CBDCs.Central bank digital currencies: Monetary anchor or market solution?Today, there are 134 countries & currency unions, representing 98 per cent of global GDP, exploring both wholesale and retail CBDCs.[3]See the Atlantic Council\\u2019s CBDC Tracker athttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/Central banks\\u2019 motivations for exploring CBDCs vary across jurisdictions. Key goals often cited by central banks include creating a digital substitute for cash in an increasingly digital society, improving control over monetary policy, achieving geopolitical and strategic autonomy, enhancing resilience, increasing the speed of payments, reducing their cost, and facilitating financial inclusion. Above all, central banks want to ensure that central bank money remains an anchor of monetary and financial stability.[4]There are numerous references made by central banks that CBDCs would reinforce central bank money as the anchor of the monetary system, as well as acting as an anchor of financial stability. For \\u2026Continue readingDesign choices for the successful rollout of any new product will always place the needs of end-users at the centre of solution development. Ultimately, CBDCs will only meet their broader policy and systemic objectives if users believe that their value improves on, and is superior to, existing market solutions and there is widespread adoption. To determine whether CBDCs ultimately meet their objectives will therefore require central banks to clearly articulate the economic or market problem that exists in today\\u2019s payment system, how the CBDC addresses or solves this problem and what \\u201csuccess\\u201d looks like. This should be based on use cases that are informed by market assessments of current and future payment needs. This means that user segments are clearly identified, the value-added benefits of the CBDC are clearly understood by all parties in the payments ecosystem and that existing payment infrastructure and technical know-how are leveraged to help rollout and delivery.However, as is the case for many CBDC initiatives around the world, the motivations expressed by central banks are predominantly focused on policy and systemic objectives, rather than being primarily driven by specific customer needs, requirements or benefits.Macroeconomic, financial policy and international considerations will likely fail to resonate with end-users who \\u2013 particularly in highly advanced payments systems \\u2013 already have fast, safe and efficient ways to make everyday payments. Paradoxically, if CBDCs are also overwhelmingly successful and achieve substantial adoption and usage, this may mean that they have displaced other types of payment instruments and deposit accounts, materializing the risks of disintermediation, deposit substitution and financial instability. In such a scenario, \\u201csuccess\\u201d may also mean that central bank money no longer acts as an anchor of monetary and financial stability, but rather becomes the cause of market disruption and instability.Currently, the design choices being explored for many retail CBDC projects replicate payment features and functionalities already offered by the private sector. They are based on the delivery of a means to hold and fund retail payments in CBDC (e.g., digital wallets), the infrastructure needed to enable those CBDC payments (e.g., online, point of sale and offline capabilities) and finally, a scheme (e.g., like the ones operated by domestic and international card networks and digital public infrastructure). While the underlying value being transferred with a CBDC is a central bank liability rather than a commercial bank liability, this distinction is largely inconsequential for the average consumer. The form factors needed will also be indistinguishable from current retail payment products.It will be critical therefore that the intended benefits of CBDCs over existing payment solutions in terms of their novel application be clearly articulated to users. To ensure its longer- term viability, central banks should also outline the incremental value that CBDCs create that exceed the significant costs associated with their development, delivery, and operation. Market participants will find it challenging to invest in new infrastructure unless there is a strong commercial business use case for doing so. Above all, CBDCs should avoid replicating market solutions in pursuit of domestic, geopolitical or macro-financial policy goals when highly advanced market solutions already exist. To do so could cause competitive distortions and inadvertently threaten the efficiencies that already exist in today\\u2019s highly evolved payments systems. It remains to be seen whether it is the role of the central bank to be direct providers of digital retail payments.Instead, central banks can ensure that central bank money remains a monetary anchor by \\u201cdoing what only central banks can do\\u201d[5]In the House of Lords debate on the Economic Affairs Committee\\u2019s Report, Lord King of Lothbury cautioned against expanding the Bank of England\\u2019s responsibilities with a retail CBDC, noting that \\u2026Continue reading). Central banks are important regulators of payment systems and they are there to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial system. Central banks are pivotal for providing the necessary regulatory framework to foster safe innovation and supporting market innovation, e.g., in the nascent form of commercial bank tokenised deposits, which could play an important role in driving new payment solutions for the future digital money landscape (Oliver Wyman and JP Morgan, 2022). Importantly, tokenised central bank reserves in the form of wholesale CBDCs, together with tokenised deposits, would maintain the strong two-tier monetary system and provide the necessary monetary anchor to ensure the \\u201csingleness of money\\u201d in an evolving digital payments age (BIS, 2023).Delivering digital public money: the \\u201ctwo-tier\\u201d distribution model and interoperabilityCentral bank proposals for CBDCs recognise that digital innovation in payments is best served under a public-private partnership, which is critical to ensuring an open and competitive payment ecosystem. This approach is aligned with the existing allocation of public and private responsibilities within the financial system, and by extending a broader set of capabilities to the private sector, it would also provide a more robust platform for the development of value-added innovations. In the context therefore for CBDCs, a truly intermediated retail CBDC model could provide a secure, fast, and resilient technology environment that avoids the unnecessary expense of parallel infrastructure and ensures that compliance requirements remain primarily with industry. This approach also ensures that the central bank retains institutional governance over core monetary infrastructure, while relying on private sector competition to drive innovation, efficiency, and a diversity of offerings.Importantly, in a well-designed two-tier approach, intermediaries would continue to play a critical role in creating trust, meeting the needs of users, and enabling the successful adoption of a CBDC. As is the case for the current ecosystem, a two-tier model is based on the central bank issuing the currency and relying on market intermediaries to determine the modalities of distribution. These intermediaries then compete to attract customers through better and more efficient products and services and develop these based on market dynamics and commercial considerations. Therefore, if the CBDC intends to promote choice and competition in a two-tier model, the modalities of distribution and acceptance should be left to intermediaries and merchants and be based on market and commercial considerations rather than regulatory solutions.Intermediated models for distributing retail CBDCs nevertheless appear to fall short of such an arrangement in emerging retail CBDC proposals. Two-tier models, such as the ones that are being considered in Europe, require intermediaries to fulfil the role as distribution agents on behalf of the central bank, which are required to carry out these functions based on legislative mandates. This means that intermediaries do not necessarily exercise agency over whether they distribute and how they can offer CBDC products based on commercial considerations. Similarly, they will not be given the freedom to choose the means through which they would be able to distribute retail CBDCs. While interoperability is cited as a key objective for CBDCs, emerging proposals seem to indicate that they would need to be distributed using only central bank run-payment rails, operating separately under their own scheme.[6]See the Digital euro packagehttps://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/digital-euro-package_enA CBDC has the potential to serve as a foundation for innovative and value-added financial products and services developed by competitors within the private sector if there is agenuine desire for a CBDC to act as a digital version of central bank money. Open and competitive payment ecosystems are critical to enabling access, adoption, and use of payment options that serve a wide range of user needs, preferences, and financial inclusion. Moreover, ongoing payments innovation and the efficiency of national and international payment flows all depend on CBDCs being interoperable with existing payment schemes to ensure seamless consumer adoption, avoid siloed ecosystems and monetary fragmentation. For a CBDC, interoperability with other stores of value (e.g., commercial bank deposits, e-money etc.) would play an important role in strengthening the domestic payment ecosystem and reinforcing the role of central bank money at its core. Sustained collaboration between the central bank and private sector participants will be critical to delivering this interoperability.A CBDC must be usable for a variety of in-person and digital transactions to provide value as a payment mechanism. However, enabling acceptance points is a prominent challenge to driving mass adoption of any new payment solution. Consumers will be more likely to adopt a CBDC if it can be used on existing acceptance infrastructure and is supported by known and identifiable payment form factors (physical and remote) linked to the user\\u2019s existing devices and accounts. Requiring CBDCs to employ new payment rails would on the other hand create artificial barriers between the CBDC and commercial bank money, causing unnecessary friction between payment means and overcomplicate access and distribution. This would generate confusion and ultimately go against the ambition of an integrated payment market.Proposals that seek to mandate acceptance and impose regulatory models of distribution call into question a true two-tier model, which could result in unintended market fragmentation with implications for competition, stability, security, and innovation within the broader payment system. CBDCs will be more competitive, innovative, resilient, and better equipped to meet various policy objectives, as well as the evolving demands of the consumer, where the project works to actively encourage the participation of all payments market stakeholders. A \\u2018two-tier\\u2019 model that is based on market-led innovation is best placed to provide a secure, fast, and resilient technology environment that avoids the unnecessary expense of parallel infrastructure and ensures resilience.Ensuring a sustainable and competitive payment ecosystemMany central banks envisage CBDCs to operate functionally as a version of \\u201cdigital cash\\u201d. This logic assumes that cash has characteristics that can be easily replicated by a digital equivalent. At a minimum, this means that users should have access to CBDCs at no additional cost, that it should be available at any time \\u2013 with or without internet connectivity \\u2013, be accepted as a means to purchase goods and services and to be able to exchange it peer to peer. Importantly, it should also be available to everyone, to ensure inclusion and equity.However, unlike the relatively simple infrastructure that is needed to print and distribute cash, building new wallet solutions, integrating with new payment infrastructure, developing offline solutions, and enabling the various links in the payment value chain are all costly andcomplex activities. Sustainable digital payment ecosystems are dependent on a delicate balancing of incentives between those stakeholders who bear the costs of enabling payments and those who benefit from payment services. For a central bank\\u2019s CBDC infrastructure to sustain a vibrant and competitive ecosystem of payments innovators, incentives will need to exist that allow payment service providers to generate an appropriate return on their investments.Compensation models therefore need to consider the potentially significant new implementation and running costs that merchants and intermediaries will need to incur to offer CBDC services. These include, but not limited to, adapting front and backend systems, customer onboarding processes, operational and other security upgrades. Many central banks are also discussing the possibility that CBDCs could run on entirely new technology, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT). Others are also considering the need to adopt state-of-the- art privacy enhancing technologies, which are promising but have yet to be run and operated at scale. Accordingly, compensation models also need to factor in the feasibility for industry to adopt such new technologies. New teams of expertise would be needed with detailed knowledge of this new technology over the lifecycle of their development, leading to potentially high operational costs and excessive complexity for some payment intermediaries.Thought should also be given to how well existing regulation is equipped to address downstream applications of a CBDC via new technologies. Regulatory guidance in this area would be essential to help participants apply existing rules to innovative payment services involving a CBDC according to whatever technological form it is designed to function. For example, if parallel DLT infrastructure is required to support a CBDC that will function offline\\u2013 consideration will need to be given to any additional regulatory requirements applicable to the use of this technology.Another key area of risk that is often given limited consideration is the enormous complexity and costs of mitigating fraud and cyber-risk across a retail CBDC ecosystem. The cost to the global economy of cybercrime is expected to grow by 15 percent per year over the next five years, reaching $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025.8 A retail CBDC will inevitably face sophisticated fraud and cyberattacks from both private and state-sponsored actors. CBDC users must trust that the system will be accessible and operational where and when it is needed; that their funds, accounts, identity, and other data are secure; and that they will be protected in the event of fraud.Importantly, unlike commercial means of payment, end users will hold the CBDC to a much higher standard given that it will be compared to its closest equivalent \\u2013 the physical banknote. Users will also assume that as it is issued and backed by the central bank (often cited as the key benefit of a CBDC) it would be more secure than commercial alternatives. Should the CBDC therefore suffer from any vulnerability due to weak end-points, the underlying credibility of the CBDC and implicitly the central bank may be impacted as a result.The premise of CBDC innovation and scalability is built on the ability of intermediaries to offer consumers new digital services to enhance the convenience and utility of their CBDC accounts. If the cost to intermediaries and service providers for the provision of the CBDC is greater than a comparable digital means of payment, industry will not be incentivized to provide high-quality CBDC services, which may affect the success of the CBDC. The same competitive conditions should therefore be applied to CBDC and comparable payment services. Likewise, if central banks propose mandatory acceptance, intermediaries and merchants must not be constrained by regulated levels of compensation or, the payment rails through which they distribute and accept a CBDC. Instead, they should be given the choice to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective way to recuperate the costs being imposed as well as deliver commercially viable solutions to their customers.From a business perspective, while merchants are applauding CBDC initiatives in the hope of reduced costs, CBDCs risk disintermediating banks in the distribution of money and constraining existing private payment solutions. The risk of endangering competition and innovation due to excessive central bank\\u2019s intervention is high. This is why it is crucial to strike the right balance between public intervention and private sector initiative in regulating CBDCs. Above all, a CBDC should be financially self-sustaining, i.e., operate without any public subsidies on investment or operational costs. Otherwise, there is a risk that the CBDC will have the unintended consequences of reducing the diversity, competitiveness, and resilience in the payment landscape.Conclusion: principles for an open, competitive, and innovative payment market using CBDCsIt is essential that governments and central banks adopt specific measures to ensure an open, competitive, and innovative payment market using CBDCs. These actions should focus on creating a level-playing field for all payment solutions, encouraging private sector participation, and fostering technological advancements. By doing so, central banks can support a dynamic financial ecosystem where multiple payment methods coexist and compete, ultimately benefiting consumers through increased choice and improved services. By focusing on ensuring a well-functioning market, central banks can drive improvements in efficiency, innovation, and service quality to the benefit of consumers and thereby remaining an anchor for monetary and financial stability.While the motivations driving central banks to explore CBDCs differ, there remains a common set of principles that all CBDC initiatives should support. These tenets will best serve the needs of consumers, preserve the health of the financial system, and ensure that consumers continue to have access to a robust and innovative array of payment options (McWaters, 2024).Promote Mutual Trust and a Global Approach to Payments.Encouraging a global regulatory framework that supports multilateral initiatives ensures that sovereignty and geopolitical goals do not create barriers to competition and investment. Strengthening the elationship between jurisdictions is essential to prevent race-to-the-bottom scenarios where national champions are favored over foreign competition. This collaborative approach will uphold the commitment of advanced economies to an open free market economy. CBDCs should be designed to integrate with existing payment solutions, promoting unity rather than exclusion in the global payments landscape.Foster Genuine Public-Private Cooperation.Establishing open and ongoing dialogue between regulators and private market participants ensures that CBDC projects are aligned with market needs and have the best chance of success. Clearly delineating the roles and responsibilities of the central bank and private entities ensures that the central bank does not encroach on market activities that are more efficiently managed by private parties. Private sector innovation can be encouraged by avoiding overly prescriptive, top-down regulation that may stifle creativity and adaptability. This collaborative approach will leverage the strengths of both public and private sectors, fostering a dynamic and innovative payment ecosystem.Ensure a Level-Playing Field.Implementing regulations that allow CBDCs and private payment solutions to compete on fair terms will ensure a level playing field. This includes avoiding undue advantages for CBDCs from both a business and regulatory perspective. To achieve this the following guidelines should be followed:Mandatory acceptance.If CBDCs are granted mandatory acceptance by merchants, they would have a significant advantage over private payment solutions, which take years to scale up merchant acceptance. Careful consideration is needed to balance this.Market-Driven Compensation and Pricing.The compensation and pricing for CBDCs should be in line with the market (ie based on market analysis, established market impact assessments and pricing regulation) to ensure fairness. Above all, public subsidies should be avoided. The cornerstone of an open market economy is based on vibrant competition which drives better consumer outcomes.Regulatory Impartiality.As the issuer and regulator, the central bank should not exploit its privileged position to disadvantage competing payment methods. Regulatory measures must be impartial.Consistent Regulatory Standards.Apply the principle of \\u201csame activity, same risk, same regulation\\u201d to ensure that CBDCs are subject to the same regulatory requirements (e.g., oversight and AML checks) as private payment solutions.Create Interoperability:Designing CBDCs to integrate seamlessly with existing national and international payment systems is critical. This means relying on widely used standards and technologies to minimize costs and implementation burdens for intermediaries, service providers and merchants. Focusing on interoperability, rather than building a new infrastructure, would increase resilience and promote innovation by allowing the industry to build new services based on existing ones, thus reducing time-to-market. Ensuring compatibility with a wide array of solutions, including traditional banking, stablecoins, and potentially other CBDCs, is essential.By taking these positive actions, central banks, governments and legislators can create an environment where both CBDCs and private payment solutions thrive, driving competition, innovation, and improved financial services for all users. Partnerships between the public and private sectors will be key to successfully ushering in transformational change, drive adoption, and create the best end-user experience. Ongoing payments innovation, expanded financial inclusion, and the efficiency of national and international payment flows all depend on vibrant private sector competition. If a CBDC is the right path for a central bank to reach its objectives, the private sector can help central banks bring their vision to life and realize their goals.ReferencesMcWaters, J., Wann, J., Baert, C., De Matteis, A., and Cuccuru, P.

A **CBDC** is a digital representation of a nation\\u2019s fiat currency, issued and regulated by its central bank. Unlike the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, **CBDCs** aim to maintain a stable value tied directly to the country\\u2019s existing currency.Countries around the globe, from theBahamasto China, are actively exploring or have already initiated **CBDC projects**. The primary objective is to enhance financial inclusion, offering secure and efficient payment options for those without access to traditional banking systems. As noted in areportby the U.S. Federal Reserve, **CBDCs** have the potential to significantly reduce cross-border transaction costs, bolster the international standing of dominant currencies like the dollar, and simplify access to financial services.However, this shift to digital currencies also presents several challenges. **Privacy concerns**, potential **cybersecurity threats**, and the impact on existing banking structures are critical issues that need careful consideration. Ensuring robust **cybersecurity frameworks** and balancing transaction monitoring to prevent financial crimes are essential steps in this journey.**CBDCs** are categorized into two main types:wholesaleandretail. Wholesale **CBDCs** are typically used by financial institutions for interbank transactions, while retail **CBDCs** are consumer-focused, allowing potentially anonymous transactions using public or private keys.While smaller nations like Jamaica, Nigeria, and the Bahamas have already implemented **CBDCs**, larger economies and groups like the G20 are still in the exploratory stages, assessing the implications for monetary policy and financial stability.For more in-depth information, the original article can be found onInvestopedia.Leave A CommentCancel replyCommentSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Total Views: 13Daily Views: 0ByCameron Academy AuthorCategories:Article,Digital Currency,FinanceTags:Central Bank Digital Currencies,Financial InclusionPublished On: December 13, 2024Last Updated: December 13, 2024Review This PageAny Further Feedback?SubmitWe have received your VOTE!

However, many cities are increasingly looking tozoning reformas a pivotal strategy to boost housing supply. AsUrban Land Magazinereports, the severity of the crisis has pushed it to the forefront of political agendas, making politicians more inclined to tackle the issue.City planner M. Nolan Gray, author ofArbitrary Lines: How Zoning Broke the American City and How to Fix It, highlights the shift in urban policies. \\u201cDozens of cities have scrapped exclusionary single-family home zoning and parking requirements, which was previously inconceivable,\\u201d Gray notes.The Shift Towards Inclusive ZoningDavid Garcia, policy director for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, underscores the growing openness tozoning changes. \\u201cMany jurisdictions are reluctant to usezoning reformdue to backlash, but the idea of allowing multiple units on single-family parcels is gaining traction,\\u201d Garcia explains.Despite the momentum, the impact of recentzoning changesis still unfolding. Garcia warns that piecemeal reforms may not achieve the desired outcomes, and comprehensivezoning changesare often challenging to implement.According to Toccarra Nicole Thomas, director of land use and development at Smart Growth America,zoninghas historically contributed to the crisis by focusing on low-density, auto-centric housing. \\u201cZoning is inherently inflexible,\\u201d Thomas asserts. She advocates for comprehensive reform to effectively generateaffordable housing.Strategies for Effective Zoning ReformGray suggests that allowing \\u201cby right\\u201d building permits could significantly streamline the development process. Other recommendedzoning reformsinclude reducing lot size requirements, eliminating parking restrictions, and allowing manufactured housing.Reducing lot size requirementsEliminating parking restrictionsAllowing manufactured housingSeveral cities have successfully implementedzoning reforms. In Oakland, California, the transformation of Auto Row into a residential hub is a prime example. Similarly, Washington, D.C., has seen the revitalization of former industrial areas like the Navy Yard and NoMa into vibrant mixed-use communities.Political Challenges and OpportunitiesZoning reformis not without its political challenges. Thomas points out that reform efforts often face opposition from NIMBYs (Not In My Backyard) and BANANAs (Building Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything). However, engaging with community stakeholders and building coalitions can help overcome resistance.Garcia advises developers to engage with communities early in the planning process to demonstrate the benefits of new housing developments. \\u201cData showing that new housing can increase the value of existing homes can be persuasive,\\u201d he says.Ultimately,zoning reformis a gradual process. As Gray emphasizes, \\u201cWe\\u2019re rolling back 100 years of policy that made it nearly impossible to build housing in dense cities, so it will take time to fix.\\u201d Yet, progress is being made, and the potential for transformative change is on the horizon.For further insights, explore theReshaping the City: Zoning for a More Equitable, Resilient, and Sustainable Futurereport and the accompanyingwebinar, featuring experts like Nolan Gray and Toccarra Nicole Thomas.\\u201c`Read More1410, 2024Florida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesGalleryFlorida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesArticle,Economics,EnvironmentFlorida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T23:49:32-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Economics,Environment|Tags:Natural Disasters,Politics|0 CommentsFlorida Faces Daunting Recovery After Dual Hurricane AssaultAsHurricane Miltongathered strength in the south-western Gulf of Mexico,Floridabraced itself for a second blow in as many weeks.

While major urban centers likeTampaandSt Petersburgnarrowly avoided the worst, other regions along the Gulf coast were not as fortunate. The devastation has been unprecedented, withdestruction sweepingthrough communities, leaving a trail of ruin in its wake.The human toll is staggering: approximately250 lives lost, countless homes destroyed, and millions left without power. The financial cost is equally severe, with early estimates placing the damage fromHurricane Miltonalone at$160 billion to $180 billion. When combined with the losses fromHurricane Helene, Florida is facing a financial hit nearinghalf a trillion dollars, a figure that threatens to erase expected economic growth for the coming quarters.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, addressing the situation, noted the resilience required to recover from such disasters. \\u201cWe did not get the worst-case scenario, but we did get hit,\\u201d he said, emphasizing the long road to recovery ahead. The state\\u2019s experience as themost hurricane-proneregion in the nation underscores the challenges that lie ahead.Even as rescue operations continue, the broader implications of these storms are becoming apparent.

TheCenter for American Progress\\u2019s reportdelves into potential solutions through local land-use reforms aimed at alleviating these pressures.The study reveals daunting statistics\\u2014nearly 11.2 million households spend over half their income on rent. This housing cost burden signals an urgent need for comprehensive strategies to ease financial pressures on renters and potential homeowners alike. The current housing market challenges, driven by historical zoning ordinances that limit affordable options, point to a reform path that could significantly alter the landscape.Local Land Use Reform as a Key SolutionThe push for reformingzoning lawsfocuses on expanding the supply of affordable housing by revisiting and updating restrictive local policies. Traditional zoning practices have long favored single-family homes, inadvertently fostering exclusion and driving up housing costs. By transitioning to more inclusive zoning codes, communities can potentially unlock a diverse range of housing solutions\\u2014without the reliance on federal or state subsidies.Federal Initiatives and Grassroots MovementsThe federal government\\u2019s proposed Building Opportunity program could be pivotal, offering financial incentives to jurisdictions that commit to significant zoning reforms.

Withcyber incidentson the rise and associated business costssoaring, many experts view it as indispensable. The globalcyber insurance marketis projected to reach a staggering $90.6 billion by 2033, underscoring its escalating relevance.Challenges in CurrentCyber Insurance PoliciesDespite its necessity, many organizations find that theircyber insurance policiesare not working effectively. According to a 2023 Delinea report, there is a growing disconnect between carriers and enterprises, leading to numerous claims beingrejected. This issue is particularly prevalent among small businesses, which face an increase incyberattacksyet often remain uncertain about their coverage details.A striking example comes from a 2022 report by the UK\\u2019s Federation of Small Businesses, revealing that 38% of its members withcyber insurancedo not know what their policy includes. Furthermore, a recent study by Aviva found that only 17% of small businesses havecyber insurance, illustrating the widespread skepticism and lack of adoption in the sector.Barriers to Effective CoverageOne of the primary barriers to effectivecyber insurance coverageis the complexity and ambiguity of policy terms. Tarnveer Singh, CISO of The Exeter, highlighted that this can lead to disputes and delays duringcyber incidents, exacerbating stress and financial strain for policyholders. The evolving nature ofcyber threatsadds another layer of complexity, often resulting in inadequate or overpriced policies.Additionally, the growing cost of premiums, projected to

IntroductionThe world is moving rapidly toward a digital future, raising questions and challenges for central banks. Digital technologies have advanced faster than any innovation in human history (Figures 1and2), and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this pace (Abidi, El-Herradi, and Sakha 2023). To keep up with this trend and harness its significant economic benefits, governments are adopting digitalization strategies to transform public services and increase their efficiency.1With payments becoming increasingly digitalized, one question is whether a structural shift from a reliance on cash to digital currencies could materialize. Many central banks are reflecting on how to achieve their policy objectives in this changing landscape. One option to preserve the key role of central bank-issued money in a digital world is to adopt a central bank digital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is a digital liability of the central bank used as a means of payment by the population (retail) or financial institutions (wholesale).View Full SizeFigure 1.Digital Ecosystems in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: International Telecommunication Union; and IMF staff calculations.Note: AE = advanced economy; CCA = Caucasus and Central Asia; EM = emerging market; GCC = Gulf Cooperation Council; ME&CA = Middle East and Central Asia; MENA = Middle East and North Africa; OE = oil exporter; Ol= oil importer.Download FigureDownload figure as PowerPoint slideAs of October 2023, 130 countries, representing 98 percent of global GDP, were exploring the potential use of a CBDC (Kosse and Mattei 2022).2,3A survey of IMF country teams representing 31 Middle East and Central Asia (ME&CA) economies4finds that 19 countries are considering or exploring a CBDC. This is consistent with information from country authorities\\u2019 public statements (Figure 3). Most ME&CA countries interested in a CBDC are at the research stage, while a few are at the proof-of-concept5stage (Bahrain, Georgia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates). Kazakhstan is most advanced in its journey to CBDC, having initiated two pilots of the digital tenge (DT; NBK 2021;Handagama 2023). The region\\u2019s fragile and conflict-affected states (FCSs) and low-income countries (LICs) have expressed limited interest. Three country case studies (Jordan, Kazakhstan, Libya), each at different stages of CBDC exploration, can be found in Annex 4.View Full SizeFigure 2.Broadband Ecosystem in ME&CA(Per 100 inhabitants)Citation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: International Telecommunication Union; and IMF staff calculations.Note: \\u201cFixed broadband subscriptions\\u201d refers to fixed subscriptions to high-speed access to the public internet (a TCP/IP connection) at downstream speeds equal to or greater than 256 kbits per second. \\u201cActive mobile broadband subscriptions\\u201d refers to the sum of active handset-based and computer-based (USB/dongles) mobile broadband subscriptions that allow access to the internet.

CBDC = central bank digital currency; ME&CA = Middle East and Central Asia.Download FigureDownload figure as PowerPoint slideEnhancing financial inclusion and domestic and cross-border payment efficiency are among the main CBDC policy objectives in the ME&CA region. The survey indicates that most ME&CA countries, especially those interested in financial inclusion (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic), are primarily interested in retail CBDCs. Hence, this paper will focus on retail CBDCs. A few countries are exploring wholesale CBDCs with local commercial banks and fintech partners (Saudi Arabia).6The key questions policymakers need to consider when exploring possible CBDC adoption are the following: What objectives do policymakers aim to achieve with a CBDC? Which inefficiencies in payment systems can CBDCs address? What are the implications of CBDC issuance for financial stability, monetary policy pass-through, and central bank operational risk? How can CBDC design help achieve policy objectives and mitigate these risks?Although there are no clear economic prerequisites to adopting a CBDC, the choice to issue a CBDC is complex and country dependent. Each country has different objectives, payment and financial systems, legal and regulatory frameworks, and central bank capacity. CBDCs are also a relatively new concept, with limited adoption and uptake to date, making it challenging to draw lessons from other countries. Hence, policymakers should approach CBDCs cautiously: successful implementation will require comprehensive analysis. In this respect, the IMF has been helping country authorities evaluate the need to issue a CBDC and establish strong policies and regulatory frameworks through capacity development. As of February 2023, seven ME&CA countries had received IMF capacity development on CBDC. In addition, the institution is leading the way with a significant number of analytical pieces,7including a comprehensive CBDC handbook guided by specific country capacity development questions on CBDC-related topics (IMF 2023b) (Box 1).Box 1.Capacity Development on Central Bank Digital CurrenciesThe IMF\\u2019s Digital Money Strategy, which the Executive Board endorsed in July 2021, gives the institution a mandate to help ensure that digital money fosters domestic and international economic and financial stability (IMF 2021a). The IMF has increased its analytical work and capacity development delivery on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The objective is to strengthen the capacity of member countries to assess, design, pilot, implement, and supervise CBDCs. Ultimately, both analytical work and capacity development delivery will contribute to country economic and financial stability and the stability of the international monetary system by making country payment systems and macrofinancial frameworks more resilient.In terms of analytical work, theIMF (2023d)released five chapters of theCBDC Virtual Handbookin November 2023. This handbook is a guide that aims to gather lessons learned and develop frameworks and guidance for member countries. It is meant to be a reference for policymakers and experts at central banks and finance ministries. This major project will generate about 20 chapters over the next five years, with four to five chapters being released per year. The chapter topics are chosen based on country needs and feasibility. The first set of chapters included a decision-making framework, a product development methodology, and implications for financial inclusion, monetary policy transmission, and capital flow management measures. The chapters will be updated regularly to reflect the latest developments and policies related to CBDCs. A second set of chapters will be published in 2024. Potential topics include financial stability; CBDC distribution, incentives, and adoption; cyber security; the relationship between CBDCs and other payment systems; cross-border payments; and implications for data frameworks and privacy protection.Regarding capacity development, the IMF works with countries through bilateral capacity development and regional workshops. The bilateral capacity development aims to provide tailored, practical, innovative, and technical advice to countries based on solid and thorough analysis and lessons learned from other countries. After capacity development delivery, countries should be better equipped to (1) understand the different uses, designs, ecosystem, and advantages and disadvantages of CBDCs; (2) understand the capacity, processes, and cost requirements involved in exploring and implementing CBDCs; (3) evaluate whether CBDCs are suitable for their economies given their specific goals, challenges, capacities, and the nature of their payment and financial sectors; (4) plan and test different stages of CBDC exploration, including creating prototypes and conducting trials to test specific policies; (5) design policies, such as regulations, to accompany CBDCs and promote financial inclusion and integrity; and (6) understand and prepare for any potential effects that their CBDC or a CBDC from another country may have on their economy. More than 30 bilateral capacity development and regional workshops have taken place, with a quarter of them focusing on Middle East and Central Asia countries. In June 2023, the IMF and Morocco co-hosted a high-level policy discussion on CBDCs to share knowledge and information among Middle East and Central Asia countries.The IMF has been actively participating in international working groups within the Group of Twenty and the Group of Seven to study how CBDCs can be used for cross-border transfers. They are exploring new ways to improve cross-border payments by analyzing innovative solutions, such as multilateral platforms, that use innovative technology to connect payments between countries using CBDCs and traditional payment systems. The IMF and World Bank have developed an approach to provide technical assistance for cross-border payments. The IMF has identified specific areas where assistance can be most effective in achieving the goals outlined in the Group of Twenty Roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments while safeguarding the integrity of the financial system.2. CBDC ObjectivesWhat objectives do policymakers hope to achieve by adopting a CBDC? Country authorities have multifaceted reasons for exploring the adoption of CBDCs (see Annex 3 for a complete list debated in the literature). The survey of IMF ME&CA country teams identifies enhancingfinancial inclusionandpayment system efficiencyas the top priorities for exploring CBDCs in the ME&CA region (Table 1).8In Middle East and North Africa (MENA) oil exporters and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the motivation for exploring CBDCs is to make payments more efficient, both domestically and cross-border (for example, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) (Schickler 2022; Central Bank of United Arab Emirates 2023). In contrast, the top priority in Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) countries is to increase financial inclusion; improving payment system efficiency and promoting innovation in financial technology are also important objectives in this region. In Georgia, where the focus is on a CBDC\\u2019s potential to promote financial inclusion, the central bank has been actively researching CBDC capabilities, design, and potential use cases since 2020 and officially launched a limited access live pilot of the digital lari with Ripple Labs through the cutting-edge Ripple CBDC platform (National Bank of Georgia 2023). MENA oil importers (for example, Jordan) also rank promoting financial inclusion and the efficiency of payment systems as key motivations for exploring CBDCs (IMF 2022d).Several lower-middle-income countries have built national agendas focused on deepening financial inclusion. In June 2021, Uzbekistan\\u2019s first National Financial Inclusion Strategy (for 2021\\u201323) identified promoting digital payments as a key priority. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan is also promoting digital banking and payments, revising and approving regulation that expands access to remote banking and provides for bank accounts to be opened remotely using digital identification (EBRD 2023).Table 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupSource: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.Table 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupCountry GroupMaking Payments More Efficient (cross-border)Making Payments More Efficient (domestic)Broadening Access to PaymentsIncreasing Financial InclusionMENA Oil Exporters\\u2713\\u2713MENA Oil Importers\\u2713\\u2713Caucasus and Central Asia\\u2713\\u2713Low-Income Countries\\u2713Gulf Cooperation Council Countries\\u2713\\u2713Fragile and Conflict-Affected States\\u2713\\u2713Emerging Markets\\u2713\\u2713Source: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.View TableTable 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupCountry GroupMaking Payments More Efficient (cross-border)Making Payments More Efficient (domestic)Broadening Access to PaymentsIncreasing Financial InclusionMENA Oil Exporters\\u2713\\u2713MENA Oil Importers\\u2713\\u2713Caucasus and Central Asia\\u2713\\u2713Low-Income Countries\\u2713Gulf Cooperation Council Countries\\u2713\\u2713Fragile and Conflict-Affected States\\u2713\\u2713Emerging Markets\\u2713\\u2713Source: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.3. Payment Systems and Benefits of CBDC in ME&CAUnderstanding payment systems and their inherent inefficiencies in the region will help ascertain the potential benefits of CBDCs and, specifically, whether CBDCs can help achieve the objectives of ME&CA policymakers to enhance financial inclusion and the efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems.A. Financial Inclusion and Payment Systems in ME&CAIn general, there is a low level of financial inclusion in ME&CA countries, though there is a marked divergence across the region. For example, access to bank accounts in ME&CA countries is lower than the global average, indicating a low level of financial inclusion (Figure 4, panel 1) (Cardarelli, Vera-Martin, and Lall 2022,Blancher and others, 2019). However, access to bank accounts is relatively higher in the GCC, while low-income Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP) countries have the lowest access. The percentage of the adult population with bank accounts ranges from 6 percent in Sudan to 90 percent in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Figure 4, panel 2). Access to bank accounts appears to correlate with countries\\u2019 income levels but remains well below the global average.Similarly, although the adoption of digital payment methods in ME&CA countries is progressing, there is considerable variation, and the region overall is behind other regions (Figure 5).9This heterogeneity in digital payment adoption could be attributed to several factors. The impact of the pandemic and the need for economic diversification have driven an increase in digital payments in the GCC countries (Economist Intelligence Unit 2020). Saudi Arabia has the fastest digital payments adoption rate thanks to a comprehensive digital payment strategy under its Vision 2030 development plan.10Within the MENA region, there is a wide discrepancy in the adoption of digital payments. Countries like the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have high levels of digital payment usage, with 85 percent, 73 percent, and 77 percent of adults utilizing digital payments in 2021, respectively. In contrast, countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have significantly lower adoption rates at 14 percent and 8 percent, respectively. This disparity in adoption rates may reflect the high cost of existing digital payment systems in some countries, which can exclude certain segments of the population. In the CCA, Kazakhstan is making significant progress in increasing digital payments, with the amount of non-cash payments increasing by 2.5 times in 2021 compared to 2019 (PwC 2023).Despite having a digitally savvy population, some ME&CA countries still heavily rely on cash for transac-tions.11Cash in circulation is particularly high in the region\\u2019s LICs and FCSs (Figure 6). For example, in Iraq and Mauritania, cash in circulation was about 26 percent of GDP in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In contrast, cash in circulation has been declining in the GCC, averaging only 5.4 percent of GDP in 2021, reflecting the region\\u2019s digital advancement.View Full SizeFigure 4.Account Ownership, 2021(Percent of adults over age 15)Citation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Global Financial Inclusion database 2021;and IMF staff calculations.Note: Data labels in the figure use International Organization for Standardization (ISO) country codes.

The region\\u2019s informal sector plays a substantial role in the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and employing about 65 percent of the labor force. Only about one-third of retail transactions are conducted electronically in the region. This high reliance on cash is also due to tax and loan debt evasion, concealment of the intended use of money, underbanked consumer and merchant segments, a cultural bias toward cash, low wealth, and lack of trust in financial institutions (Figure 7) (Abidi and others 2023;Gatti and others 2014;Chan and others 2021).View Full SizeFigure 6.Reliance on Cash in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Haver Analytics; ILOSTAT database; national authorities; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Cash ratios are computed as currency in circulation divided by nominal GDP.

Remittance flows to ME&CA countries reached $447 billion in 2021, dwarfng other high-volume flows such as portfolio investment and official development assistance. However, the most common way to send and receive domestic remittances is still by another person using cash (Figure 8, panel 2).12The opposite is true in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, where account-based remittance transfers are most common, followed by those from money transfer operators. Cost does not seem to be a key impediment since the cost of remittances across all corridors and providers from the MENA region to receiving countries is below the global and sub-Saharan Africa averages (Figure 8, panels 3 and 4).View Full SizeFigure 8.Remittances in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: IMF, Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics database; World Bank, Remittance Prices Worldwide; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Sent or received domestic remittances: using an account (percent age 15+).

Benefits of CBDCs in ME&CACBDCs can help policymakers achieve their primary objectives of enhancing financial inclusion and payment system efficiency (domestic and cross-border) if they can address the inherent gaps in current systems.Financial InclusionCBDCs have the potential to advance financial inclusion by creating more competition for consumers and allowing for transactions to be settled more directly through reduced intermediation, thereby lowering the cost of financial services and making them more accessible. Unlike commercial banks, the lack of a profit motive by the central bank can also help keep costs lower. Considering that the financial system in the ME&CA region is heavily bank-dominated with a relatively high profit margin, CBDCs have the potential to advance financial inclusion.CBDCs could also help enhance the service quality for payment service providers (PSPs) and spur further innovation in the digital payment system by simplifying market entry for PSPs and removing the need for negotiations to access specific payment infrastructures and banking services. Similar effects could be achieved through policy reforms that enable nonbank entities to access central bank accounts and provide risk-based, fair, and transparent access to critical payment infrastructures, as seen in the case of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, given that a CBDC would carry the safety of central bank money and legal tender status, it could help overcome distrust in financial services and broaden access. CBDCs could also provide the needed technological infrastructure from scratch (a \\u201cclean slate\\u201d) if it does not already exist; hence, providing a public good that may be particularly relevant for LICs and FCSs, which may lack such infrastructure and where the share of the underserved population is particularly high.Payment SystemsCBDCs have the potential to help improve the efficiency of payment systems, both domestic and cross-border. By spurring competition in the domestic payment market, CBDCs can lower costs and update legacy technology platforms. As for cross-border payment systems, these are prone to various frictions, such as fragmented and truncated data formats across regions, complex processing of compliance checks, limited operating hours across jurisdictions, lack of payment system interoperability (due to differences in domestic legislation), and legacy technology platforms. These frictions result in high fees due to multiple intermediaries (correspondent banking) and a lack of guarantee as to whether the funds have been received in full (that is, finality). CBDCs could simplify the intermediation chains and increase availability (as they would operate on a 24/7 basis) by starting a \\u201cclean slate\\u201d system designed to achieve interoperability between different jurisdictions and allowing for real-time payment service (BIS, IMF, and World Bank 2021). The United Arab Emirates\\u2019 mBridge project is a good example for aiming to resolve these inefficiencies with wholesale CBDCs.By improving the efficiency of cross-border payments, CBDCs could also enable the flow of international remittances. This, in turn, can play an essential role in supporting economic development and financial inclusion.13CCA and MENA oil-importing economies, considering their high reliance on cash, including for remittances, could reap significant gains from improving the efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems. Cheaper and more accessible remittances will benefit senders and recipients, help buffer economic shocks, and stimulate growth.Despite the potential of CBDCs to improve financial inclusion and improve payments systems efficiency, it is crucial to recognize that CBDCs are not a panacea. Therefore, policymakers should conduct a comprehensive analysis of the various alternatives as some of the benefits of CBDCs could be achieved through other means. For example, facilitating the entry of new players in the market and providing comprehensive regulation and supervision of the entities to uphold the stability and integrity of the payment system can also improve competition. Increased competition could also occur through improved access to central bank accounts by PSPs, to avoid intermediaries in payment services provision.CBDCs may also not be able to overcome existing barriers to financial inclusion, such as those due to limited identification and financial literacy, low wealth, and high informality, which tend to be associated with a strong preference for physical cash. Regarding cross-border payments, some regional initiatives are already addressing inefficiencies by fostering payment system interoperability. Specifically, the GCC Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and the Arab Regional Payment System aim to streamline intraregional payment flows and improve the cross-border payment ecosystem (Box 2). In addition, CBDCs could coexist with other payment systems already in place and are not an either/or solution.Box 2.Improving Cross-Border Payment SystemsGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS)Led by the six central banks of the GCC (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates)What will it do?The GCC RTGS will provide an overarching regional payment system connecting the individual domestic RTGS payment systems of each of the six GCC countries, enabling an efficient delivery of intra-GCC payments in the fiat currencies of the six countries. For example, a Saudi riyal payment originated in the United Arab Emirates and destined for a beneficiary in Saudi Arabia would occur over the domestic United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabian payment systems, instead of relying on bilateral correspondent banking frameworks.What are the benefits?The GCC RTGS would create standardization, drive efficiency, bring predictability, and reduce costs, as cross-border payments would previously be delivered using domestic payment system architecture. This would bring the experience of a pan-regional cross-border payment closer to that of a domestic payment.Arab Regional Payment System (known as BUNA)Led by the Arab Monetary FundWhat will it do?The system aims to create a central routing agent to provide a standardized payment experience across the Arab countries. With a common set of operating rules and a standardized SWIFT platform, BUNA would bring together the markets of the GCC and the Middle East and North Africa for all intraregional payments, covering not just the fiat currencies of the Arab countries but also key principally traded currencies such as the US dollar and euro.What are the benefits?Already \\u201clive\\u201d with the Emirati dirham, Egyptian pound, and Saudi Arabian riyal, BUNA is looking to augment currencies, countries, and commercial bank participation over the near to medium term to provide efficiency and standardization to intraregional cross-border payments. Soon, BUNA aims to enhance the platform further by introducing instant and real-time delivery of pan-regional cross-border payments and providing the foundation to support other financial market infrastructure.Sources: Arab Monetary Fund; andChan and others (2021).4. Financial Systems and Financial Stability Implications of CBDCs in ME&CAUnderstanding ME&CA financial systems will help to ascertain how CBDCs may affect financial stability in the ME&CA region. The relatively healthy financial systems in the region could support CBDC adoption. However, a country-specific analysis is paramount, including given the heterogeneity of financial systems across the region.A. ME&CA Financial SystemsME&CA financial systems are primarily dominated by banks (Figure 9). Nonbank financial institutions\\u2014 pension funds, asset management and finance companies, and insurance\\u2014are underdeveloped in the region and are generally not involved in credit intermediation. Banks\\u2019 total assets reached $2.4 trillion in 2021 (185 percent of GDP), up from $1.7 trillion in 2016 (149 percent of GDP).14,15Still, there is significant heterogeneity across the region.In the GCC, financial systems are large, having grown in recent years thanks to buoyant economic activity fueled by large hydrocarbon proceeds and abundant liquidity. At the end of 2021, banks\\u2019 lending to GDP reached $2.7 trillion (or 198 percent of non-oil GDP) compared to other emerging markets (44 percent of GDP). Bahrain (the smallest GCC economy) ranks first in terms of banking system size with a ratio of banking system assets to non-oil GDP of 552 percent, while Saudi Arabia (by far the largest economy in the region) has the smallest ratio of banking system assets to non-oil GDP of 100 percent.Financial sectors in the CCA region are relatively small and underdeveloped. Georgia has the largest banking sector in the region and is close to the global average of emerging markets, as measured by banking system assets to GDP. In contrast, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan have relatively small banking sectors, less than half the size of the average banking sector in the region.Banking systems in the MENAP region are relatively heterogeneous. Jordan and Morocco have the largest banking sectors within this subregion. Despite the relative size of the economy, Pakistan\\u2019s banking sector is relatively small (47 percent of banking system assets to GDP).View Full SizeFigure 9.Bank Asset Structure in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Fitch Connect; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Figure uses 2021 values.

        "value": "The introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is poised to have significant impacts on the traditional banking system and financial stability over the next five years. Here are some key considerations based on the available reference materials:\n\n1. **Impact on Traditional Banking:**\n   - **Bank Disintermediation:** CBDCs could potentially lead to disintermediation of traditional banks, as consumers might prefer holding CBDCs directly with central banks over traditional bank deposits. This could lead to reduced bank deposits, affecting banks' ability to lend and potentially increasing their reliance on equity and wholesale funding (Cameron Academy, European Economy).\n   - **Competition and Innovation:** CBDCs could spur competition in the payment market by lowering costs and encouraging innovation. They might simplify access to financial services and open the market for new players, including fintech companies, to offer innovative payment solutions (IMF, European Economy).\n   - **Role of Banks:** Banks might play a different role in distributing CBDCs, potentially acting as intermediaries in a two-tier system where they distribute CBDCs issued by the central bank. This could impact their revenue models and necessitate adaptation to new operational roles (Cameron Academy, European Economy).\n\n2. **Financial Stability:**\n   - **Monetary Policy Transmission:** CBDCs could enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy by providing central banks with better tools to control the money supply directly. This could lead to more efficient monetary policy transmission and potentially enhance financial stability (Cameron Academy).\n   - **Risk Management:** There are concerns regarding the operational risks for central banks managing CBDCs, including cybersecurity threats and privacy issues. Effective implementation will require robust cybersecurity frameworks and privacy measures to maintain trust and security (Cameron Academy, IMF).\n   - **Cross-Border Transactions:** CBDCs could improve the efficiency of cross-border payments by reducing costs and processing times, thus potentially enhancing financial stability by facilitating international trade and reducing transaction frictions (IMF).\n\n3. **Regulatory and Policy Frameworks:**\n   - To ensure a balanced impact on financial stability, comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be needed. These frameworks should address issues such as cybersecurity, data privacy, and the interoperability of CBDCs with existing financial systems (Cameron Academy, European Economy).\n\nIn conclusion, while CBDCs offer opportunities for improving payment systems and financial inclusion, their introduction will require careful consideration of their impacts on traditional banking and financial stability. Policymakers will need to address potential risks through robust regulatory frameworks and ensure that the benefits of CBDCs are realized without undermining the existing financial system."

These benefits are also largely applicable to digital currencies like CBDCs. Digital payments tend to be cheaper, better and faster than physical cash transactions, which makes them instrumental for increasing financial inclusion and reducing transaction costs for individuals and businesses. CBDCs aim to combine the benefits of digital currencies with the reliability of traditional financial systems. The introduction of CBDCs could also impact international financial stability, as countries would need to navigate the complexities of cross-border digital currency transactions. CBDCs could lead to more resilient and inclusive financial systems, reducing the dependence on physical cash and traditional banking infrastructure.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their potential impact on ...\\nURL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42521-023-00090-0\\nCONTENT: Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their potential impact on traditional banking and monetary policy: an initial analysis | Digital Finance The economics of Central Bank Digital Currency.

This study\\u2019s objectives are as follows: 1) To show how the model variables react to shocks in CBDC uncertainty in terms of equal-interval and time-point impulse responses, and expose the lagged relationship between CBDC uncertainty and financial variables in terms of the TVP-SV-VAR model; 2) To demonstrate the volatility spillover effects among financial variables by using the BEKK-MGARCH model; and 3) To determine whether CBDC uncertainty has varying impacts on financial variables at different frequencies (under normal and extreme conditions) by employing WQC analysis.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[9]:\\nTITLE: CBDC and banking stability: Modeling cascading effects on reserves ...\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090944324000693\\nCONTENT: It is based on this observation that this article aims to analyse the potential impact of the introduction of CBDCs on the banking system, with a focus on the effects of excess confidence in CBDCs, the effects of covering each CBDC issuance with mandatory reserves in fiat currency, the effects of higher interest rates in the context of CBDC issuance, and the effects of rapid growth in the creation of scriptural money in the context of CBDCs. To achieve our objective, we employ dynamic modelling of the behaviour of the main economic agents, namely the central bank and secondary banks, to derive a dynamically stable unique equilibrium model.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nQuery: how will CBDCs affect banks over the next five years\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: CBDCs will further fragment the global economy\\u2014and could threaten the ...\\nURL: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/cbdcs-will-further-fragment-the-global-economy-and-could-threaten-the-dollar/\\nCONTENT: By the end of 2023, over 130 central banks representing 98 percent of global GDP will have initiated programs to develop central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Most central banks are working on both retail and wholesale CBDCs. Central banks expect to launch a little later than they expected to last year. The likelihood that a wholesale CBDC will be issued within the next six years is now greater than that for retail.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Outlook 2025: Will central banks pick up the pace on CBDCs?\\nURL: https://currencyinsider.com/2025/01/10/outlook-2025-will-central-banks-pick-up-the-pace-on-cbdcs/\\nCONTENT: Holding limits, the maximum amount of digital currency that users could hold in an account, is another concern that central banks would need to address.

The OMFIF said technical challenges are no longer a serious obstacle for the vast majority of central banks; in previous surveys, technical features like offline payments, privacy and interoperability with existing payment systems were cited as barriers to a CBDC. The survey also found that the share of central banks responding that they were more inclined to issue a CBDC dropped to 18%, down from 38% in 2022.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: Preserving the Dollar: The Role of CBDCs in Securing Economic Stability ...\\nURL: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2024/07/16/preserving-the-dollar-the-role-of-cbdcs-in-securing-economic-stability-for-future-generations/\\nCONTENT: Issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can help developed countries including the United States counteract these trends. ...

Opening this service to various providers would have the most serious impact on banks, however restricting it to the Central Bank only, will also deprive banks of profits from transaction processing due to outflow of deposits in fiat currency to CBDC. The most impactful approach would allow direct exchange of banking deposits in fiat currencies into CBDC.

A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a form of digital currency issued by a country's central bank. A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is the digital form of a country's fiat currency. A nation's monetary authority, or central bank, issues a CBDC, which promotes financial inclusion and simplifies the implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. Understanding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) CBDCs, backed by a government and controlled by a central bank, would give households, consumers, and businesses a secure means of exchanging digital currency.

The IMF Working Paper authored by Romain Bouis, Gaston Gelos, Paavo Miettinen, Fumitaka Nakamura, Erlend Nier, and Gabriel Soderberg, from the International Monetary Fund\\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets department, examines the implications of retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on financial stability. The authors highlight that the financial stability effects of CBDCs depend on several key factors, including the size of the issuance, the initial conditions of the financial system, and how both banks and central banks react. One of the central concerns raised in the paper is that the issuance of CBDCs could lead to disruptions in the traditional banking system, particularly in terms of financial intermediation.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: (PDF) The Impact of Digital Currencies on Traditional Banking: A ...\\nURL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388490670_The_Impact_of_Digital_Currencies_on_Traditional_Banking_A_Comparative_Study_of_Emerging_Markets\\nCONTENT: CBDCs are designed to work within the existing banking infrastructure, they could still undermine traditional banks by providing a direct digital alternative to bank deposits.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Examining the impact of a central bank digital currency on the access ...\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521924001522\\nCONTENT: Lastly, the fifth strand explores the link between CBDCs and the banking sector, proposing a model in which CBDCs afford central banks greater autonomy over the banking system, potentially impacting the role of commercial banks due to the possibility of central banks gaining a monopoly over bank deposits (Fernandez-Villaverde et al., 2021\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: The future of the international financial system: The emerging CBDC ...\\nURL: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rego.12520\\nCONTENT: The technical and regulatory complexity of CBDC requires central banks to have sufficient capacity to meet these issues.

These currencies work without central banks and governments using cryptography as a security means. They are alternatives to conventional banking systems. Bitcoin is the first currency of this kind, and since then, many others have been developed, such as Ethereum and Ripple.\\nThis increasing demand for digital currency traces back to a constantly rising need for decentralized systems, hence enabling efficient transactions with fewer intermediaries. These systems thus save cost while efficiently facilitating the process of transaction. As digital currency becomes popular, it is going to affect traditional banking.\\nIn this context, financial institutions are threatened with potential disruptions in their established business model and hence require a re-evaluation of strategy to integrate digital currency into their services. In this scenario, the transition would also have a change in consumer behavior as user behavior changes for ease and security in a transaction of digital currency.  \\nThis paper addresses the impact of digital currencies on traditional banking, looking at the challenges and opportunities ahead, and the ever-changing regulatory landscape. By studying these factors, a better understanding of the future of banking in the era of digital currencies will be developed.\\nWhat is a digital currency?\\nDigital currency is a medium of exchange that only comes in electronic form and is widely known as digital money, electronic money, electronic currency, or cybercash. In contrast with traditional currency, digital currencies do not have a physical counterpart and therefore cannot be physically handled or stored. They allow consumers and businesses to conduct transactions and trade in a virtual environment.\\nTypes of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currency is a broad term encompassing various forms of currency that exist solely in the electronic domain. Generally, digital currencies can be categorized into three main types:\\nCryptocurrencies\\nCryptocurrencies are digital currencies that deploy the use of cryptography not only to secure and confirm transactions in a network but also to govern creation. Notable examples comprise Bitcoin and Ethereum. The use of cryptocurrencies is regulated at a country-by-country and often viewed as virtual, as they live purely in the digital environment.\\nVirtual Currencies\\nVirtual currencies are unregulated digital currencies managed by developers or a founding organization composed of various stakeholders. They may also be governed by a specific network protocol. An example of a virtual currency is a gaming network token, whose economic framework is determined by its developers.\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\\nA central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a regulated digital currency issued by a country's central bank. In contrast to the traditional fiat currencies having physical and digital forms, the CBDC is purely digital. It is government-backed and seeks to make payments more efficient, reduces risks associated with cash handling, and promotes financial inclusion.\\nAdvantages of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currencies provide several significant benefits:\\nFast Transfers: The transactions are efficient and often free, happening directly between parties with no necessary intermediaries, unlike traditional banking systems.\\nNo Physical Manufacturing: They eliminate the need for the production of physical currency, which would otherwise be defective and contaminated.\\nMonetary Policy Implementation: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) allow governments to distribute payments directly to citizens, simplifying monetary processes without physical currency logistics.\\nLower Transaction Costs: Digital currencies enable direct payments within networks, reducing costs compared to physical currencies by cutting out middlemen.\\nDecentralization: Many digital currencies operate without government or financial institution control, enhancing resistance to censorship and manipulation.\\nPrivacy: Transactions are not tied to personal data, providing users with anonymity and confidentiality.\\nGlobal Accessibility: Anyone with internet access can use digital currencies, making them especially valuable in regions lacking traditional banking services.\\nDisadvantages of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currencies come with several notable drawbacks:\\nStorage and Infrastructure Issues: Although physical wallets are not required, digital currencies necessitate reliable internet access, smartphones, and secure online wallets for storage and processing.\\nHacking Vulnerability: The digital nature of these currencies makes them targets for hacking. Instances of stolen currencies from online wallets highlight the ongoing challenges of securing digital assets.\\nPrice Volatility: Digital currencies can experience significant price fluctuations, driven by market speculation and investor sentiment. This volatility can complicate their use as stable forms of currency.\\nLimited Acceptance: Many retailers and businesses do not yet accept digital currencies, making it difficult to use them for everyday transactions despite their growing popularity.\\nIrreversibility: Transactions made with digital currencies are final and cannot be reversed. This can pose challenges in cases of errors or fraud, particularly for newcomers who may lack familiarity with the technology.\\nEvolution of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currencies have evolved significantly since their inception, beginning with early concepts in the 1980s. David Chaum introduced\\u00a0eCash\\u00a0in 1983, a precursor to modern cryptocurrencies, which allowed for anonymous transactions. The late 1990s saw attempts like\\u00a0B-money\\u00a0and\\u00a0Bit Gold, but these did not achieve widespread success.\\nThe true breakthrough came in 2009 with the launch of\\u00a0Bitcoin\\u00a0by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who introduced blockchain technology, enabling secure, decentralized transactions without intermediaries. This innovation spurred the creation of thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), each aiming to improve upon Bitcoin's framework.\\nBy 2023, digital currencies had gained mainstream attention, with various countries exploring regulatory frameworks and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to integrate these innovations into traditional financial systems, marking a significant shift in the landscape of global finance.\\nWhat are Traditional Banking Systems?\\nTraditional banking systems are physical finance facility that accepts, deposits, provides loans, and facilitates payments and investments. The government authorities regulated the banking system which was operated through branches and ATMs, thereby being stable and protecting consumers as well as significant to the economy while facilitating various financial transactions.\\nAdvantages of Traditional Banking\\nIn-Person Visits: Traditional banks cater to customers who are skeptical about transacting through the internet. Customers can go to these banks within official working hours for several financial services like depositing cash, withdrawing, international transfers, and opening new accounts. There are also safe deposit boxes offered for customers to store valuable things and face-to-face contact that protects against fraud and identity theft.\\nFinancial Security: Traditional banking ensures security whereby money is safe and insured in case of any bank-related problems. There is a minimal threat of hackers or impersonators to account information if the customers are careful.\\nAccess to Loans: Traditional banks, having been around for ages in lending, have strict rules in place regarding interest rates and repayment terms. This is a sure guarantee that customers get the fairest of deals, unlike the predatory digital loan platforms that prey on borrowers with outrageous interest rates.\\nDisadvantages of Traditional Banking\\nCost of Transactions: Traditional banks impose fees for a range of services, from ATM maintenance to balance inquiries. These fees can accumulate over time, particularly if account holders do not maintain minimum balances or frequently transfer funds to other banks.\\nComplexity in Handling Customer Complaints: Although traditional banks offer face-to-face customer service, the complaint-resolution process might take a long time compared to an online bank. This is because the resolution often involves paperwork and bureaucratic procedures, which takes time.\\nAvailability: Traditional banks have special office hours that limit a customer's duration of accessing banking services. In case, the customer runs into problems outside office hours, he or she has either to refer the problem to online representatives or wait till the next business day.\\nStructure of Traditional Banking\\nThe structure of traditional banking consists of various components that work together to provide financial services. Key elements include:\\nHeadquarters: The central office where top management and corporate functions are located, overseeing the entire banking operations.\\nBranches: Physical locations where customers can access banking services, including opening accounts, depositing funds, and applying for loans. Branches are strategically placed to serve local communities.\\nATMs: Automated Teller Machines allow customers to perform basic banking transactions, such as withdrawals, deposits, and bala[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.digipay.guru/blog/rise-of-digital-currencies-and-impact-on-traditional-banking/\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nDigital Currencies: The Rise & Impact on Traditional Banking\\n\\nPlatform\\nSolutions\\nUse Cases\\nResources\\nCompany\\nRequest a Demo\\nMobile Payment ,\\nThe rise of digital currencies and their potential impact on traditional banking\\nThe rise of digital currencies and their potential impact on traditional banking\\nUpdated on February 22, 2023\\n9 min read\\nSHARE\\nDigital currencies, or virtual currencies, are digital or virtual forms of money that use cryptography for security. They are decentralized and operate independently of central banks or governments. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known digital currency, was created in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.\\nSince the creation of Bitcoin, a growing number of digital currencies have been developed. Some notable examples include Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin. These currencies have gained increasing attention and adoption over the past decade, with the total market capitalization of digital currencies namely bitcoin reaching over $1.28 trillion in 2021.\\nThis blog post will explore the rise of digital currencies and their potential impact on traditional banking. It will examine the factors driving the growth of digital currencies, the changes that may occur to financial institutions' business models, and the potential challenges and opportunities for banks in the face of this emerging trend.\\nAdditionally, the blog post will also cover the current regulatory landscape and potential future developments in government oversight of digital currencies.\\nThe rise of digital currencies\\nThe use of digital currencies has been steadily increasing over the past decade. According to a report by Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, there were an estimated 35 million unique digital currency users in 2021, with this number expected to continue to grow. In addition, a growing number of businesses, both online and offline, have begun to accept digital currencies as a form of payment.\\nApart from that, the digital currency market is dominated by a few key players. Bitcoin, the first and largest digital currency, has a market capitalization of over $421.35 billion in 2023. Other major players include Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin, each with market capitalizations of over $100 billion.\\nMoreover, the growth of digital currencies is driven by several factors. One major factor is increased interest in decentralized and trustless systems, as digital currencies operate independently of central banks or governments.\\nAdditionally, the growth of digital currencies has been driven by increasing recognition of their potential as a store of value and means of payment, as well as the increasing ease of buying and using digital currencies.\\nThe growing adoption of digital currencies by both individuals and businesses, as well as the increasing number of options for storing and using digital currencies, has also contributed to their growth.\\nAdvantages of Digital Currencies for Traditional Banks\\nThe popularity of digital currencies has been rising due to the myriad advantages that it provides. Some of the major advantages of digital currencies are mentioned below:\\n\\nSpeed and efficiency\\nFintech solutions like digital currencies have transformed the banking industry as it uses decentralized systems and blockchain technology, which allows for faster and more efficient transactions.\\nTransactions can be processed 24/7 without the need for intermediaries, such as banks. This means that transactions can be completed in a matter of minutes, rather than the days or weeks it can take with traditional banking.\\n\\nRead More: Top fintech solutions transforming the banking industry\\n\\nDecentralization and security\\nDigital currencies operate on a decentralized system, meaning that no single entity controls the currency. This decentralization also makes digital currencies more secure as there is no central point of failure. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger (the blockchain) which is secure and transparent.\\nLower transaction costs\\nDigital currencies can have lower transaction costs compared to traditional banking. This is because digital currencies do not require intermediaries such as banks, which can charge high fees for services like currency exchange and wire transfers.\\nAdditionally, digital currencies can also eliminate the need for physical currency, which can be costly to produce and distribute.\\nImproved customer experience\\nThe use of digital currencies has resulted in improved customer experience. Such currencies are renowned for their unparalleled convenience and seamlessness when used to carry out transactions.\\nUnlike traditional banks which come with difficult processing times, prolonged paperwork, and limited banking hours, digital currencies deliver instant and swift transactions. Through this, they present customers with a persuasive value proposition that traditional banks are finding challenging to reach.\\nNew revenue streams\\nTraditional banks can tap into new revenue streams as digital currencies become more prevalent.\\nThis means that banks can leverage the growing popularity of digital currencies by extending their customer base to include digital currency enthusiasts and businesses preferring digital currencies for their transactions. By doing so, they can create a more diverse customer base, while also boosting revenue streams.\\nThe potential impact of digital currencies on traditional banking\\nDigital currencies have the potential to greatly impact traditional banking. One of the most significant ways is by providing an alternative to traditional banking systems, which could lead to a decrease in the need for traditional banks.\\nDigital currencies allow for peer-to-peer payment app transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks. This could lead to lower transaction fees and faster, more efficient transactions.\\nChanges to financial institutions' business models\\nThe rise of digital currencies has the potential to significantly disrupt traditional banking business models. Digital currencies operate on decentralized systems, which do not rely on the intermediation of financial institutions and can be done through various digital payment apps.\\nThis could lead to disintermediation, where financial institutions are removed from the process of intermediating transactions. This could also lead to a reduction in revenue for traditional banks, as they would no longer be able to charge fees for services such as currency exchange and international money transfers.\\nEffects on consumer behavior and transaction processes\\nThe use of digital currencies could lead to changes in consumer behavior and transaction processes. Digital currencies allow for faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions, which could lead to increased adoption by consumers.\\nThis could also lead to changes in the way transactions are processed, as digital currencies operate on decentralized systems, which do not rely on the intermediation of financial institutions.\\nBoosting cross-border transactions\\nDigital currencies and other innovations in payment systems, such as mobile money and blockchain technology, have the potential to revolutionize the way we make transactions.\\nThey offer the possibility of faster, cheaper, and more efficient domestic and cross-border transactions, making it easier for people to access financial services and participate in the global economy.\\nFor example, by using digital currencies, people living in remote or rural areas, who may not have access to traditional banking services, can now easily transfer money to relatives or make payments for goods and services via digital banking. Thus, financial technologies like digital currencies are transforming international remittances.\\n\\nRead More: Impact of fintech on international remittances\\n\\nHence, digital currencies have the potential to greatly impact traditional banking by providing an alternative to traditional banking systems, increasing financial inclusion, and changing the way we think about money and financial systems.\\nHowever, the extent of this impact is still uncertain, and more research and development are needed to fully understand the implications of digital currencies on traditional banking.\\nPotential challenges and opportunities for banks\\nThe rise of digital currencies poses both challenges and opportunities for traditional banks. On one hand, digital currencies could lead to disintermediation and a reduction in revenue for banks.\\nOn the other hand, banks could explore ways to integrate digital currencies into their existing business models, such as offering cryptocurrency digital wallet solutions or facilitating the exchange of digital currencies.\\nAdditionally, some banks have started to research and invest in digital currencies and blockchain technology, which would allow them to stay competitive in the ever-changing market.\\nGovernment regulations and oversight\\nCurrent regulatory landscape\\nThe regulatory landscape for digital currencies varies by country. Some countries, such as Japan and South Korea, have embraced digital currencies and have implemented regulations to support their growth.\\nOther countries, such as China and India, have taken a more cautious approach and have placed restrictions on the use and trading of digital currencies. In the United States, digital currency regulations are still evolving, with different states and federal agencies taking different approaches.\\nThe U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued guidance on how existing regulations apply to digital currencies, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued guidance on how digital currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are considered securities.\\nFuture developments\\nAs the use of digital currencies continues to grow, government regulations and oversight will likely continue to evolve. Some experts predict that governments will eventually implement regulations to preven[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443123001324\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nImplications of central bank digital currency for financial stability: Evidence from the global banking sector - ScienceDirect\\nSkip to main contentSkip to article\\n\\n\\n\\nJournals & Books\\n\\n\\nHelp\\n\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n\\nMy account\\nSign in\\n\\nView\\u00a0PDF\\nDownload full issue\\n\\nSearch ScienceDirect\\n\\nJournal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money\\nVolume 89, December 2023, 101864\\n\\nImplications of central bank digital currency for financial stability: Evidence from the global banking sector\\nAuthor links open overlay panelHiep Ngoc Luu a, Canh Phuc Nguyen b, Muhammad Ali Nasir b c\\nShow more\\nAdd to Mendeley\\nShare\\nCite\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.intfin.2023.101864Get rights and content\\nUnder a Creative Commons license\\nopen access\\nHighlights\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nThe adoption of CBDC contributes to financial stability.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nA CBDC helps to reduce leverage and portfolio and asset risks.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nAdoption of a CBDC is found to be associated with increased lending.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nCBDC adoption has a more positive impact in emerging economies than in advanced economies.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nRetail CBDC promotes stability, whereas wholesale CBDC hampers it.\\n\\n\\nAbstract\\nThis study analyses the implications of central bank digital currency (CBDC) for financial stability, specifically in the banking sector. Drawing on an international database on CBDC adoption, data on 1176 banks operating in 86 countries from 2010 to 2021 were used to construct a time-varying CBDC adoption index. Our key results suggest that the adoption of CBDC contributes to financial stability. Furthermore, bank size, capitalization, operational strategy, deposit funding and domestic investment also contribute positively while loan loss reserve negatively affects bank stability. These findings are robust to a comprehensive set of tests. We further find that CBDC helps to reduce leverage and asset risks. Other evidence suggests that the adoption of CBDC can be associated with expanded lending, increased asset quality and reduced loan loss reserves. However, the impact of CBDC is only pronounced for banks of reasonable size but not for smaller banks. Moreover, CBDC adoption appears to have a more positive impact in emerging economies than in advanced economies. Finally, retail CBDC is found to promote stability, whereas wholesale CBDC hampers it.

We\\u2019ll also explore how blockchain innovations, like\\u00a0Lightchain Tokens (LCAI), are paving the way for decentralized systems that could either complement or challenge the rise of CBDCs.\\nWhat are Central Bank Digital Currencies?\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital forms of a nation\\u2019s fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and represent a direct liability of the central bank, ensuring stability and trust.\\nThey are designed to complement physical cash, providing a digital alternative for transactions and payments. CBDCs can be categorized into two types. retail and wholesale. Retail CBDCs are intended for use by the general public, facilitating everyday transactions, while wholesale CBDCs are designed for financial institutions to streamline large-scale interbank transfers and settlements.\\nThe implementation of CBDCs aims to enhance payment efficiency, promote financial inclusion, and provide a secure, government-backed digital payment option. As of 2023, numerous central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting CBDCs to adapt to the evolving digital economy and maintain monetary sovereignty.\\nHow Do CBDCs Work?\\nEach country may have its own unique approach to implementing CBDCs, but in general, they work similarly to traditional fiat currencies. The main difference is that CBDCs are entirely digital and operate on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform. This allows for real-time, secure transactions, with the central bank acting as the intermediary.\\nConsumers can hold their CBDCs in digital wallets provided by commercial banks or directly through the central bank. Transactions using CBDCs can be conducted online or offline, making them easily accessible and convenient for everyday use.\\nCentral banks may also have control over the supply of CBDCs, allowing them to implement monetary policies more effectively. They may also have the ability to monitor transactions and combat illegal activities like money laundering.\\nThe Role of Lightchain AI in the CBDC Landscape\\nLightchain AI\\u00a0is poised to transform the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) landscape by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism enhances transaction security by validating operations through AI-driven computations, ensuring robust protection against fraud and cyber threats.\\nThe platform\\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) facilitates scalable solutions for centralized digital currencies, enabling efficient processing of high-volume transactions essential for CBDC implementation.\\nBy merging AI with blockchain,\\u00a0Lightchain AI offers\\u00a0a secure, scalable, and efficient framework for central banks exploring digital currency issuance, potentially revolutionizing the future of digital finance.\\nPotential Impact on Traditional Banking Systems\\nThe introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could significantly impact traditional banking systems. One primary concern is the potential for bank disintermediation, where customers might prefer holding funds in CBDCs over traditional bank deposits, perceiving them as safer or more convenient. This shift could reduce the deposit base of commercial banks, affecting their ability to lend and manage liquidity.\\nTo mitigate such risks, central banks might implement measures like limiting individual CBDC holdings or ensuring that CBDCs are non-interest-bearing, making them less attractive as a savings vehicle compared to bank deposits.\\nAdditionally, the coexistence of CBDCs and traditional bank money necessitates functional consistency to prevent fragmentation in payment systems. Establishing common operational characteristics across all forms of regulated digital money is essential to maintain stability and public confidence in the financial system.\\nLightchain Tokens (LCAI) A Disruptive Force in the CBDC Landscape\\nLightchain AI\\u00a0is a blockchain ecosystem that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance scalability, privacy, and decentralization.

A February 2025 Guide\\nContent:\\nChina's e-CNY is one of the biggest global CBDC experiments and is now expanding to Hong Kong.\\nAs digital transformation continues to reshape the financial landscape, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are emerging as a pivotal development. This article delves into what CBDCs are, their purpose, how they compare to traditional currencies andcryptocurrencies, and their advantages and challenges. By the end, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of CBDCs and their potential impact on the global economy.\\nA Central Bank Digital Currency is a digital form of a country's fiat currency issued by its central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and regulated by the government. They represent a digital equivalent of physical cash, aimed at modernizing the financial system and improving monetary policy efficiency. The concept of CBDCs has evolved over the years, driven by advancements in digital technology and the growing need for efficient payment systems.\\nThere has been alot of research doneon the benefits of shifting to digital payments. These benefits are also largely applicable to digital currencies like CBDCs. Digital payments tend to be cheaper, better and faster than physical cash transactions, which makes them instrumental for increasing financial inclusion and reducing transaction costs for individuals and businesses.\\nFor central banks, who are typically the organizations that are responsible for developing and launching CBDCs, CBDCs can help to maintain monetary sovereignty in the face of growing cryptocurrency usage and alternative digital payments. This was one of the key drivers behind China\\u2019s push to launch the e-CNY in the face of increasing competition from Alipay and WeChat Pay in the mainland China financial industry.\\nCBDCs offer the same functions as traditional currency but in a digital format. They can be used for payments, savings and investments, with the added benefits of reduced physical cash handling and improved transaction traceability.\\nMost CBDCs are accessed through adigital walleton a smartphone or device. Certain implementations of CBDCs like the e-CNY in China also provide for physical offline cards that can be used for contactless transactions, not unlike a traditional credit card. This format is particularly important where digital infrastructure is lacking as it allows for completely offline transactions.\\nCBDCs sit in the middle cash, federal reserves and bank accounts.\\n\\nUnlike decentralized cryptocurrencies likeBitcoinBitcoin, CBDCs are issued and regulated by central banks, ensuring stability and trust. CBDCs aim to combine the benefits of digital currencies with the reliability of traditional financial systems.\\nIn addition, as CBDCs are typically pegged 1:1 with traditional currencies, they don\\u2019t have the volatility that plagues most crypto-currencies as they are designed to be stable representations of traditional currency.\\nCBDCs can either be considered eitherwholesale or retail CBDCs.\\nRetail CBDCs are digital currencies available to the general public. They can be used for everyday transactions, similar to cash or bank deposits. Retail CBDCs aim to enhance financial inclusion by providing a digital payment option accessible to everyone.\\nWholesale CBDCs are intended for financial institutions and are used for interbank settlements and large-value transactions. They improve the efficiency and security of financial transactions between banks.\\nOne of the most significant advantages of CBDCs is the potential to enhance financial inclusion. In many parts of the world, a substantial portion of the population remains unbanked or underbanked, lacking access to traditional financial services. CBDCs can help ameliorate this by offering a digital payment method that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status.\\nThis can be particularly impactful in developing countries where banking infrastructure is limited. By enabling direct access to central bank funds, CBDCs can empower individuals and small businesses, fostering economic participation and reducing inequality.\\nCBDCs can also significantly reduce transaction costs for both consumers and businesses. Traditional payment systems often involve multiple intermediaries, each adding their own fees to the transaction process. CBDCs streamline this by enabling peer-to-peer transactions directly between parties without the need for intermediaries.\\nThis not only lowers costs but also speeds up transaction times. For businesses, especially those operating on tight margins, the reduction in transaction costs can translate into substantial savings, improving profitability and encouraging more efficient business operations.\\nSecurity is a critical concern in the digital age, and CBDCs offer enhanced security features compared to traditional cash and current digital payment systems. CBDCs leverage advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and protect against fraud. Unlike physical cash, which can be lost or stolen, digital currencies can be tracked and authenticated, reducing the risk of theft.\\nAdditionally, central banks can implement stringent security protocols and continuous monitoring to detect and prevent cyber threats. This enhanced security framework not only protects individual users but also contributes to the overall stability of the financial system.\\nTraditional banking systems can be slow, especially for cross-border transactions, which often take several days to settle. CBDCs can facilitate near-instantaneous transactions, both domestically and internationally. This increased speed can improve cash flow for businesses, reduce waiting times for consumers and enhance the overall efficiency of the financial system. Faster transaction speeds are particularly beneficial in emergency situations where immediate access to funds is crucial.\\nThe implementation of CBDCs raises significant privacy concerns. Unlike cash transactions, which are inherently private, digital transactions can be monitored and tracked by central authorities. This level of surveillance can lead to concerns about the erosion of personal privacy and the potential for misuse of transaction data.\\nFurthermore, the centralization of financial data in a CBDC system could create a single point of failure, making it an attractive target for cybercriminals. Ensuring that robust privacy protections and data security measures are in place will be crucial to addressing these concerns.\\nCBDCs are susceptible to cybersecurity threats, including hacking, digital fraud and other malicious activities. The digital nature of CBDCs means they require advanced security measures to protect against these threats.\\nCentral banks will need to invest heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and continuously update their systems to combat evolving threats. The risk of large-scale cyber attacks poses a significant challenge, as a successful breach could undermine trust in the entire financial system.\\nThe widespread adoption of CBDCs could disrupt existing financial systems. Traditional banks play a crucial role in the economy by providing loans and other financial services. If consumers and businesses move their deposits from commercial banks to CBDCs, it could reduce the banks' ability to lend, potentially leading to a credit crunch.\\nAdditionally, CBDCs could alter the dynamics of monetary policy. Central banks would have to manage the supply and demand of digital currency carefully to avoid inflation or deflation. The introduction of CBDCs could also impact international financial stability, as countries would need to navigate the complexities of cross-border digital currency transactions.\\nSeveral countries are at the forefront of CBDC adoption, each exploring different models and approaches. China, for example, has made significant strides with its e-CNY, and after conducting extensive pilot programs in major cities, the digital currency is now live across the country and increasingly overseas. These initiatives aim to modernize payment systems, enhance financial inclusion and increase the efficiency of transactions.\\nSimilarly, Sweden is testing the e-krona as part of its efforts to reduce the reliance on physical cash. These pilot programs provide valuable insights into the practical applications of CBDCs and highlight the benefits and challenges of digital currencies.\\nOther countries, such as the Bahamas with its Sand Dollar and Nigeria with its eNaira, have also launched their own CBDCs, focusing on improving financial access and economic resilience. The global trend towards CBDCs reflects a growing recognition of the need to innovate and adapt to the digital economy.\\nThe future of CBDCs looks promising, with the potential to revolutionize global economies by improving payment systems, enhancing financial inclusion and providing more efficient monetary policies. As more countries explore and adopt CBDCs, significant advancements in the digital currency landscape are expected.\\nCBDCs could lead to more resilient and inclusive financial systems, reducing the dependence on physical cash and traditional banking infrastructure. They may also foster greater innovation in financial services, driving the development of new payment solutions and financial products, especially as cross-border CBDC payment infrastructure improves.\\nHowever, the successful implementation of CBDCs will require addressing various challenges, including ensuring robust cybersecurity measures, protecting user privacy, and managing economic impacts. The collaboration between central banks, financial institutions and technology providers will be crucial in shaping the future of digital currencies.\\nCBDCs represent a significant shift in the way we perceive and use money. By understanding what CBDCs are, their benefits and the challenges they pose, we can better appreciate their potential impact on the future of finance.

They are designed for payment, store of value, and unit of account. They can offer various benefits, such as reducing transaction costs, increasing financial inclusion, and improving transparency and security.\\nOne of the critical areas where CBDCs have the potential to make a significant impact is monetary policy and financial stability. Monetary policy refers to the actions central banks take to regulate the money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives such as price stability and full employment. CBDCs could give central banks more significant control over the money supply and interest rates, allowing for more effective implementation of monetary policy.\\nSimilarly, CBDCs could also impact financial stability, which refers to the soundness and resilience of the financial system. CBDCs could potentially improve financial stability by reducing the risk of fraud and increasing transparency while also offering the potential for greater financial inclusion. However, there are also potential risks and challenges associated with CBDCs, which must be carefully considered and addressed to maximize their potential benefits.\\nMonetary policy refers to the actions taken by a central bank to regulate the money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives such as price stability and full employment. CBDCs could significantly impact monetary policy, given their digital nature and central banks\\u2019 control over issuance and circulation.\\nOne of the potential benefits of CBDCs for monetary policy is that they could give central banks more significant control over the money supply and interest rates. Because CBDCs are digital, they can be created and distributed more quickly and efficiently than physical currency, allowing central banks to respond more rapidly to changes in economic conditions. CBDCs could also enable central banks to implement more precise and targeted monetary policies since they could track money movement more closely and adjust interest rates more quickly.\\nAnother potential benefit of CBDCs for monetary policy is enabling central banks to implement negative interest rates more quickly. Negative interest rates refer to a situation where depositors are charged to keep their money in a bank rather than earning interest on their deposits. This is a tool that central banks have used in the past to stimulate spending and investment during periods of economic weakness. Still, it can take time to implement effectively using physical currency. However, with CBDCs, negative interest rates could be implemented more quickly since central banks could adjust the interest rate on CBDC balances.\\nHowever, there are also potential challenges associated with implementing CBDCs in conjunction with other monetary policy tools. For example, if CBDCs become widely adopted, they could crowd out different forms of money, such as bank deposits or physical currency. This could have unintended consequences for monetary policy and financial stability, requiring careful management and coordination by central banks. Additionally, introducing CBDCs could require significant changes to the existing monetary policy framework, which must be carefully considered and communicated to ensure a smooth transition.\\nFinancial stability refers to the soundness and resilience of the financial system and is essential in preventing financial crises that can have widespread economic consequences. CBDCs could significantly impact financial stability, given their digital nature and potential for greater transparency and security.\\nOne of the potential benefits of CBDCs for financial stability is that they could offer greater transparency and reduce the risk of fraud. CBDCs would be issued and backed by a central bank, which would provide greater assurance to users that their funds are safe and secure. Additionally, CBDC transactions could be recorded on a blockchain, potentially providing greater transparency and traceability than traditional financial transactions.\\nAnother potential benefit of CBDCs for financial stability is that they could offer greater financial inclusion. CBDCs would be accessible to anyone with a smartphone or internet connection, which could provide payment and financial access to individuals who traditional financial institutions currently underserve. This could reduce inequality and promote economic growth.\\nHowever, there are also potential challenges related to privacy and security concerns associated with CBDCs. Since CBDC transactions would be recorded on a blockchain, there could be concerns about the privacy and security of user data. Additionally, there could be concerns about the potential for cyber attacks or other security breaches that could compromise the integrity of the CBDC system.\\nTo ensure that CBDCs contribute to financial stability, it will be necessary to consider these potential risks and challenges carefully and to develop appropriate safeguards and regulatory frameworks to mitigate them. This will require collaboration and coordination between central banks, financial regulators, and other stakeholders to ensure that CBDCs are introduced responsibly and sustainably.\\nWhile CBDCs offer potential benefits for monetary policy and financial stability, some risks and challenges must be considered. These include:\\nDisintermediation and potential impact on banks: CBDCs have the potential to disrupt the traditional banking system by allowing users to hold and transact directly with the central bank. This could lead to disintermediation, where banks lose deposits and become less able to provide credit to the economy. This could have unintended consequences for monetary policy and financial stability, requiring careful management by central banks.\\nCybersecurity risks: CBDCs are digital assets and are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other forms of digital fraud. Any system that handles CBDCs must be robustly secured and regularly tested to minimize the risk of theft or fraud. Additionally, introducing CBDCs could require significant investments in cybersecurity infrastructure to ensure the system is secure and resilient.\\nPotential for increased volatility in financial markets: CBDCs could introduce new volatility sources into financial markets. For example, if CBDCs are issued faster than physical currency, this could lead to inflation and changes in exchange rates. Additionally, introducing CBDCs could lead to changes in the demand for other forms of money, such as bank deposits or physical currency, which could have unintended consequences for financial stability.\\nTo minimize these potential risks and challenges, it will be necessary for central banks and other stakeholders to carefully consider the implications of CBDCs for monetary policy and financial stability and to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks and risk management strategies to mitigate these risks. This will require collaboration and coordination between central banks, financial regulators, and other stakeholders and a commitment to ensuring that CBDCs are introduced responsibly and sustainably.\\nIn conclusion, CBDCs have the potential to significantly impact monetary policy and financial stability, offering benefits such as greater control over the money supply and increased transparency and financial inclusion while also introducing potential risks such as disintermediation and cybersecurity risks. As such, the development and implementation of CBDCs must be approached with careful consideration and planning.\\nCentral banks and other stakeholders must work together to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks, risk management strategies, and cybersecurity infrastructure to mitigate the potential risks associated with CBDCs. This will require a collaborative effort to ensure CBDCs are introduced responsibly and sustainably, focusing on maximizing benefits while minimizing risks.\\nWhile introducing CBDCs will undoubtedly present challenges, it also offers an opportunity to enhance the financial system\\u2019s efficiency, security, and inclusiveness. With careful planning and coordination, CBDCs could strengthen monetary policy and financial stability and promote more significant economic growth and prosperity.\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-macroeconomic-implications-of-cbdc-a-review-of-the-literature.htm\\nTitle: The Fed - The Macroeconomic Implications of CBDC: A Review of the Literature\\nContent:\\nNovember 2022\\nSebastian Infante,Kyungmin Kim,Anna Orlik,Andr\\u00e9 F. Silva, andRobert J. Tetlow\\nAbstract:\\nThis paper provides an overview of the literature examining how the introduction of a CBDC would affect the banking sector, financial stability, and the implementation and transmission of monetary policy in a developed economy such as the United States. A CBDC has the potential to improve welfare by reducing financial frictions in deposit markets, by boosting financial inclusion, and by improving the transmission of monetary policy. However, a CBDC also entails noteworthy risks, including the possibility of bank disintermediation and associated contraction in bank credit, as well as potential adverse effects on financial stability. A CBDC also raise important questions regarding monetary policy implementation and the footprint of central banks in the financial system. Ultimately, the effects of a CBDC depend critically on its design features, particularly remuneration.\\nKeywords:Financial stability, Monetary policy, banking, central bank digital currency, central banking\\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2022.076\\nPDF:Full Paper\\nRelated Materials:Accessible materials (.zip)\\nDisclaimer:The economic research that is linked from this page represents the views of the authors and does not indicate concurrence either by other members of the Board's staff or by the Board of Governors.

As central banks globally explore the possibilities of CBDCs, their progress, challenges, and potential impact on traditional banking are subjects of significant interest and debate.\\nProgress in CBDC Development:\\nSeveral central banks around the world are actively researching and experimenting with CBDCs. China, with its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) project, has made substantial strides, piloting CBDCs in various cities and testing their application in real-world scenarios. Other countries, including the United States, the European Union, and Japan, are also exploring the development of CBDCs, each with its unique approach and considerations.\\nThe potential benefits of CBDCs include increased efficiency in payment systems, enhanced financial inclusion, and the ability for central banks to have more direct control over monetary policy. However, these advantages come with their own set of challenges and considerations.\\nChallenges in CBDC Implementation:\\nTechnological Infrastructure: Developing a secure and scalable technological infrastructure is a primary challenge in CBDC implementation. The distributed ledger technology (DLT) or blockchain, often considered for CBDCs, must accommodate large transaction volumes while ensuring robust security measures to prevent cyber threats.\\nPrivacy Concerns: CBDCs raise concerns about privacy, as digital transactions can potentially be traced more easily than traditional cash transactions. Striking a balance between privacy and regulatory oversight is crucial to ensure public trust in the new digital currency.\\nCross-Border Compatibility: For CBDCs to realize their full potential, they need to be interoperable across borders. This requires international cooperation and the development of common standards to facilitate cross-border transactions seamlessly.\\nImpact on Commercial Banks: The introduction of CBDCs may disrupt the traditional banking sector. If consumers opt to hold CBDCs directly with the central bank, it could reduce the amount of funds held in commercial banks, impacting their ability to lend and potentially altering the dynamics of the traditional banking system.\\nPotential Impact on Traditional Banking:\\nChanging the Payments Landscape: CBDCs have the potential to revolutionize the payments landscape by offering a faster, more efficient, and cost-effective alternative to traditional payment systems. This could lead to a decline in the use of physical cash and traditional banking services for day-to-day transactions.\\nFinancial Inclusion: CBDCs can address issues of financial inclusion by providing a digital currency accessible to individuals who may not have access to traditional banking services. This can bridge the gap between the banked and unbanked populations, fostering greater economic participation.\\nMonetary Policy Tools: CBDCs grant central banks more direct control over monetary policy. With the ability to implement negative interest rates or distribute funds directly to citizens, central banks can respond more effectively to economic challenges. However, this also requires careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences.\\nCommercial Banks' Role Redefined: The introduction of CBDCs may redefine the role of commercial banks. If consumers can hold digital currency directly with the central bank, traditional banks may need to adapt their business models, potentially focusing more on value-added services rather than serving as custodians of deposits.\\nConclusion:\\nAs central banks advance in their exploration and implementation of CBDCs, the financial landscape is on the brink of significant transformation. The progress made in CBDC development is a testament to the potential benefits these digital currencies could bring, from increased efficiency to financial inclusion. However, the challenges, including technological hurdles, privacy concerns, and the potential impact on traditional banking, must be navigated carefully.\\n*Join our WhatsApp Channel to get the latest news, exclusives and videos on WhatsApp*\\n_____________\\nDisclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

It suggests policy options, including careful CBDC design, to mitigate these risks and balance the benefits with financial stability.\\nThe IMF Working Paper authored by Romain Bouis, Gaston Gelos, Paavo Miettinen, Fumitaka Nakamura, Erlend Nier, and Gabriel Soderberg, from the International Monetary Fund\\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets department, examines the implications of retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on financial stability. This detailed study looks at how the issuance of a CBDC to the general public could impact the balance sheets of both central banks and commercial banks, with a particular focus on the risks and opportunities this transition might present. The authors highlight that the financial stability effects of CBDCs depend on several key factors, including the size of the issuance, the initial conditions of the financial system, and how both banks and central banks react. Through scenario analysis, the paper explores how balance sheets might change in different environments, whether under normal conditions or during crises, and the potential impacts on financial stability.\\nRisks to Financial Intermediation\\nOne of the central concerns raised in the paper is that the issuance of CBDCs could lead to disruptions in the traditional banking system, particularly in terms of financial intermediation. The scenarios outlined in the study suggest that if CBDCs replace a significant portion of commercial bank deposits, the banking system could face challenges in maintaining stable and low-cost funding. This is particularly true when commercial banks do not have excess reserves to absorb the demand for CBDCs, forcing central banks to expand their balance sheets by providing more reserves. In such cases, banks may need to rely on more costly or volatile wholesale funding, which could lead to higher lending costs and reduce the overall availability of credit to businesses and consumers. Additionally, during periods of financial stress, there is a risk of \\\"digital bank runs,\\\" where depositors rapidly move their funds from traditional banks into CBDCs, exacerbating liquidity crises.\\nImpact on Bank Profitability and Lending\\nThe paper also discusses the potential consequences of CBDC adoption on banks' profitability. As banks lose cheaper deposit funding and are forced to replace it with more expensive central bank or wholesale funding, their profitability could decline. This, in turn, could lead to increased risk-taking as banks try to maintain profit margins, or it could prompt a reduction in lending to the private sector, which would have negative implications for economic growth. The authors argue that these risks are particularly pronounced when CBDC adoption is rapid or occurs during a financial crisis, as banks may struggle to adjust to the new environment in which deposits are being diverted into digital currencies.\\nMacroprudential Policies and Central Bank Lending\\nIn exploring potential policy responses to these challenges, the paper suggests several options that central banks and regulators might consider. One possibility is to adjust macroprudential policies to account for the new risks introduced by CBDCs, such as tightening capital and liquidity requirements for banks. However, the authors note that macroprudential policies alone are unlikely to be sufficient to fully mitigate the risks associated with CBDC issuance. Another potential solution is to expand central bank lending to the commercial banking system, particularly during times of stress. By providing additional liquidity through mechanisms such as longer-term refinancing operations, central banks could help ensure that banks have the necessary funding to continue lending, even if they face significant deposit outflows due to CBDC adoption.\\nDesigning CBDCs to Mitigate Risks\\nNevertheless, the most promising approach, according to the study, is to carefully design CBDCs in a way that limits their potential to disrupt the banking system. Specifically, the authors advocate for CBDC designs that encourage their use as a means of payment rather than as a store of value. This could be achieved through features such as imposing limits on the amount of CBDC individuals can hold or offering zero or negative interest rates on CBDC balances. These design choices would help prevent large-scale shifts of deposits from commercial banks into CBDCs, thereby reducing the risk of financial instability. Moreover, ensuring interoperability between CBDCs and traditional bank-operated payment systems could further mitigate these risks by allowing for a smoother integration of CBDCs into the existing financial system.\\nBalancing Benefits with Financial Stability\\nThe paper concludes by emphasizing that while CBDCs offer several potential benefits such as reducing the costs of producing and handling cash, improving financial inclusion, and enhancing the efficiency of payment systems these benefits must be weighed against the potential risks to financial stability. The authors argue that without careful consideration of these risks, CBDCs could lead to significant disruptions in the banking system, particularly if they are widely adopted in a short period of time or during times of economic stress. Therefore, central banks must carefully design CBDCs and consider a range of policy tools to ensure that their introduction does not inadvertently harm the broader financial system.\\n TRENDING \\n OPINION / BLOG / INTERVIEW \\n DevShots \\n Latest News \\n\\n\\r\\n                    Controversy Over Early Leave for Ramzan Sparks Political Debate in Telangana\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                    Delhi Sessions Court Stays Magistrate Order Over FIR Against Police in 2020 Riots Case\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                    Honda Achieves 2-Crore Milestone in Southern India\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                    City's Markets to Shine: Night Sweeping Initiative Launched\\r\\n                \\n\\n Connect us on \\n Email: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15 \\n\\u00a9 Copyright 2025\\n\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://fxpredator.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdcs/\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nThe Pros and Cons of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\\nFXPredator\\n\\u00b7\\n\\u00b7\\nTable of Contents\\nCBDCs: Exploring the Digital Divide of Centralized Control\\nIntroduction\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital forms of fiat currencies issued and regulated by central banks.

        "value": "The introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is poised to significantly impact the traditional banking system and financial stability over the next five years. Several factors underscore this potential transformation, including changes in consumer behavior, alterations to financial institutions' business models, and implications for monetary policy and financial stability.\n\n### Impact on Traditional Banking Systems\n\n1. **Disintermediation and Consumer Behavior**: CBDCs may encourage consumers to hold their funds directly with central banks instead of commercial banks, which could lead to disintermediation. This shift means fewer deposits for traditional banks, affecting their ability to provide loans and manage liquidity effectively. If consumers perceive CBDCs as safer and more convenient, this could exacerbate existing challenges for banks, particularly smaller institutions that lack substantial capital reserves to absorb such changes (https://www.currencyinsider.com).\n\n2. **Revenue Challenges for Banks**: As CBDCs might reduce the transaction fees banks currently earn from payment processes, traditional banking revenue sources could dwindle. Banks may need to adapt their business models, focusing more on value-added services rather than solely relying on custodianship of deposits. This adaptation may challenge existing banks to identify new revenue streams while facing potential profitability declines (https://www.analyticsinsight.net).\n\n3. **Changes in Payment Systems**: The efficiency of CBDCs in facilitating faster, cheaper transactions could lead to a general shift in payment preferences. With lower transaction costs and improved processing times, consumers might prefer using CBDCs for both everyday transactions and larger financial transfers, potentially diminishing the relevance of traditional banking services (https://www.digipay.guru).\n\n### Financial Stability Implications\n\n1. **Enhanced Financial Stability**: CBDCs can promote financial stability by improving transparency and offering a safer alternative to private cryptocurrencies. For instance, CBDCs issued by central banks are backed by state authority, which provides assurance against fraud (https://www.imf.org). Studies indicate that well-designed CBDCs could reduce leverage and associated risks in the banking sector, particularly in emerging economies (https://www.sciencedirect.com).\n\n2. **Regulatory and Monetary Policy Changes**: The adoption of CBDCs allows central banks to have direct control over the money supply and implement monetary policies more effectively. This capability includes potential measures such as direct monetary relief through CBDC distributions in times of economic distress, thereby enhancing the agility of central banks in responding to economic changes (https://www.forbes.com). However, if CBDCs are designed to replace a significant portion of bank deposits, it could risk limiting the effectiveness of traditional monetary policy tools (https://www.macroeconomic implications).\n\n3. **Cybersecurity Risks and Stability**: While CBDCs enhance security through advanced technology, they also carry cybersecurity risks. A successful cyber attack on CBDC infrastructure could undermine public trust in the entire financial system, prompting bank runs or rapid shifts of deposits to CBDCs during crises (https://www.fxpredator.com). Thus, the design and implementation of robust cybersecurity measures will be crucial in maintaining financial stability as CBDCs are rolled out (https://www.devdiscourse.com).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOver the next five years, the introduction of CBDCs is expected to challenge the traditional banking system by altering consumer behavior and revenue dynamics, necessitating an adaptation by financial institutions. Simultaneously, CBDCs hold the potential to enhance financial stability through improved transparency and the ability to implement effective monetary policies. However, to achieve these benefits, central banks will need to carefully consider the design features of CBDCs, address cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and potentially implement regulations to mitigate risks of disintermediation. This balancing act will be vital to harnessing the full potential of CBDCs while safeguarding the integrity of the financial system."

The experiences of China e-CNY deployment have raised interesting research questions on central bank digital currency that deserve further investigation.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: GlobalData Survey Reveals Challenges in Consumer Adoption of CBDCs\\nURL: https://defi-planet.com/2025/01/globaldata-survey-reveals-challenges-in-consumer-adoption-of-cbdcs/\\nCONTENT: Crypto Crypto Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are facing challenges in adoption, even in countries where they have been officially launched. Blandina Szalay, a banking and payments analyst at GlobalData, attributes the limited adoption of CBDCs in countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, and Nigeria to the absence of compelling incentives for consumers to transition from traditional payment methods. Meanwhile, a September 2024 report from the Atlantic Council revealed that 134 countries, covering 98% of the global economy, are exploring CBDCs. Over 65 nations, including India, Australia, and Brazil, are in the advanced stages of piloting or launching digital currency projects. \\u201cTake control of your crypto portfolio with MARKETS PRO, DeFi Planet\\u2019s suite of analytics tools.\\u201d Crypto Crypto Crypto\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Central bank digital currencies: Consumer data-driven sustainable ...\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523005528\\nCONTENT: It assesses if CBDC policy should be guided by consumer data.

The IMF Working Paper authored by Romain Bouis, Gaston Gelos, Paavo Miettinen, Fumitaka Nakamura, Erlend Nier, and Gabriel Soderberg, from the International Monetary Fund\\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets department, examines the implications of retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on financial stability. The authors highlight that the financial stability effects of CBDCs depend on several key factors, including the size of the issuance, the initial conditions of the financial system, and how both banks and central banks react. One of the central concerns raised in the paper is that the issuance of CBDCs could lead to disruptions in the traditional banking system, particularly in terms of financial intermediation.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: What Risks Are Associated with CBDCs? - cbdcstrategies.com\\nURL: https://cbdcstrategies.com/what-risks-are-associated-with-cbdc/\\nCONTENT: Though there are a lot of advantages that come with CBDCs, there are also setbacks that central banks and policymakers should deal with. Such are some of the highlighted risks in the issuance and use of CBDCs: 1. Financial Stability Risks.

According to the report, more than 90 per cent of central banks currently engage in some form of CBDC work, and around two-thirds of central banks consider that they were likely to or might possibly issue a retail CBDC in either the short or medium term. Avoiding the \\u201cDigital Bank Run: In times of financial stress, CBDCs might become a safer haven than commercial bank deposits, enabling rapid fund transfers and potentially triggering a \\u201cdigital bank run.\\u201d To mitigate this, central banks need to design CBDCs that emphasise transactional use rather than long-term holding.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: A literature review on the design and implementation of central bank ...\\nURL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42495-023-00125-9\\nCONTENT: Next category deals with the mainstream theoretical research on the potential macro policy and financial stability implications of CBDCs; yet also extends into alternative topics, such as the indispensable role of central bank money in payment networks,Footnote 1 currency competition, and private and public money coexistence schemes. Besides the functional monetary policy improvements purported by macro policy and financial stability research, most of the expected benefits of introducing CBDCs need more evidence to make a winning case for central bank digital currencies. Alternative literature partly focuses on the practical results from regulatory preparations and adoption challenges, while some scholars study relevant historical arguments for CBDCs. The socioeconomic impact of the digitalization of money, currency competition between private and public money, and direct access to central bank liabilities are vital themes that researchers focus on to bridge past research with the recent rise of digital currencies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: PDF\\nURL: https://www.bis.org/review/r221031j.pdf\\nCONTENT: Thus the challenges of the economic of cbdc require a) the analysis the potential impact on the role of supervised financial intermediaries and on the transmission of monetary policy and financial stability and b) the ability to meet the end-user needs including privacy issues and the integration with existing retail payment schemes/systems; The introduction of a CBDC can influence the transmission of monetary policy and financial stability through several channels that are mainly related to the substitution of commercial bank deposits with a public digital currency.

Associated with this trend, in the last few decades the literature has substantially increased. The recent development of intensive computational tools that can transform text into data, provides additional ways to analyse and corroborate the benefits of greater communication and central banks' sentiment. Textual analysis has become itself a source of information and feedback for central banks.\\n\\nContribution\\n\\nWe use unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to turn the text that private banks send to their clients about the Mexican economy into vectors of topics. Then, we use NLP to determine the issues that the economic analysts discuss the day before and the day after of the Monetary Policy Announcement (MPA), and also the day before and the day after of the Monetary Policy Minutes in Mexico.\\n\\nFindings\\n\\nWe find that every time, private banks cover a large diversity of topics and words before the MPA with no evident consensus of topics, and that almost always the quantities of terms and topics are reduced and repeated by almost every bank after the MPA indicating some surprise, and that the topics vary depending on the date of the MPA. We also found weak evidence that a measure of the size of the changes in the private bank's communication with their clients is positively correlated to changes in the long-term yields but negatively correlated to the size of exchange rate movements.\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nWe determine if the communication of private banks to their clients with financial interests in Mexico changes or not after Mexico's Central Bank communicates its monetary policy decision (MPD) and also two weeks later, with the publication of the minutes of Mexico's Central Bank monetary policy decision (MMPD) between 2011 and 2019. We use unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to turn the text that private banks send to their clients about the Mexican economy into vectors of topics. We find that every time, private banks cover a large diversity of topics and words before the MMPD with no evident consensus of topics, and that almost always the quantities of terms and topics are reduced and repeated by almost every bank after the MMPD indicating some surprise (notable exception: the liftoff in December 2015), and that the topics vary depending on the date of the MMPD. The fact that private banks discuss the same topics and write to their clients with sentences that contain the exact same words indicates that the private banks react to the MMPD, independent of their opinion about the Central Bank's statements. We also found weak evidence that a measure of the size of the changes in the private bank's communication with their clients is positively correlated to changes in the long-term yields but negatively correlated to the size of exchange rate movements.\\n\\nJEL classification: C6, E5, E6.\\n\\nKeywords: natural language processing, unsupervised sentence embedding, central bank communication, Mexico.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-future-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-opportunities-and-challenges/: HTTP 404: Not Found\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fintech-notes/Issues/2022/02/07/Progress-with-Central-Bank-Digital-Currencies: Error: <StreamReset stream_id:1, error_code:2, remote_reset:True>\\n\""

Central banks want to use CBDCs to modernize financial systems and improve how people transact. Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized systems, whereas CBDCs are centralized digital currencies regulated by governments. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are a new form of digital currency that some governments are considering rolling out to support and supplement their own money and financial systems. Additionally, CBDCs offer central banks a chance to modernize financial systems using digital technology. This centralized set-up gives the central bank the power to oversee and regulate transactions involving CBDCs. Understanding the rollout of a potential digital pound in the UK can help unpack the way CBDCs work: Retail CBDCs: Central banks issue digital currencies directly to the public and companies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: Central Bank Digital Currencies - CRS Reports\\nURL: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11471\\nCONTENT: Central Bank Digital Currencies Policymakers have debated whether the Federal Reserve (Fed) should create a central bank digital currency (CBDC)\\u2014a \\\"digital dollar.\\\" A CBDC would share some of the features of cryptocurrencies (crypto)\\u2014that is, private digital currencies such as Bitcoin, which are unsupported by any government authority.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Central bank digital currencies - Executive Summary\\nURL: https://www.bis.org/fsi/fsisummaries/cbdcs.htm\\nCONTENT: In contrast, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are a direct liability of the central bank and as such do not carry any credit risk. There are two types of CBDC. Retail CBDCs (rCBDCs) are intended for the general public, aiming to provide a risk-free and digital means of payment for everyday transactions.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: What Does Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Mean? - Forbes\\nURL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/what-does-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc-mean/\\nCONTENT: As digital transformation continues to reshape the financial landscape, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are emerging as a pivotal development. These benefits are also largely applicable to digital currencies like CBDCs. Digital payments tend to be cheaper, better and faster than physical cash transactions, which makes them instrumental for increasing financial inclusion and reducing transaction costs for individuals and businesses. CBDCs aim to combine the benefits of digital currencies with the reliability of traditional financial systems. The introduction of CBDCs could also impact international financial stability, as countries would need to navigate the complexities of cross-border digital currency transactions. CBDCs could lead to more resilient and inclusive financial systems, reducing the dependence on physical cash and traditional banking infrastructure.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Central Bank Digital Currencies: Policy Issues - CRS Reports\\nURL: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46850\\nCONTENT: Central Bank Digital Currencies: Policy Issues The recent proliferation of private digital currencies or cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, has led to questions of whether the Federal Reserve (Fed) should create a central bank digital currency (CBDC)\\u2014a digital dollar that would share some of the features of these private digital currencies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Central bank digital currencies: A critical review - ScienceDirect\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521923005471\\nCONTENT: Central bank digital currencies: A critical review - ScienceDirect Central bank digital currencies: A critical review This critical literature survey offers a comprehensive understanding of the key aspects and implications of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a rapidly evolving area of academic and policy research.

This article delves into what CBDCs are, their purpose, how they compare to traditional currencies and cryptocurrencies, and their advantages and challenges. By the end, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of CBDCs and their potential impact on the global economy.\\nUnderstanding Central Bank Digital Currency\\nWhat Does Central Bank Digital Currency Mean?\\nA Central Bank Digital Currency is a digital form of a country's fiat currency issued by its central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and regulated by the government. They represent a digital equivalent of physical cash, aimed at modernizing the financial system and improving monetary policy efficiency. The concept of CBDCs has evolved over the years, driven by advancements in digital technology and the growing need for efficient payment systems.\\nWhy Use CBDCs?\\nThere has been a lot of research done on the benefits of shifting to digital payments. These benefits are also largely applicable to digital currencies like CBDCs. Digital payments tend to be cheaper, better and faster than physical cash transactions, which makes them instrumental for increasing financial inclusion and reducing transaction costs for individuals and businesses.\\nFor central banks, who are typically the organizations that are responsible for developing and launching CBDCs, CBDCs can help to maintain monetary sovereignty in the face of growing cryptocurrency usage and alternative digital payments. This was one of the key drivers behind China\\u2019s push to launch the e-CNY in the face of increasing competition from Alipay and WeChat Pay in the mainland China financial industry.\\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR\\n\\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\\nBy Kevin Payne, Contributor\\n\\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\\nBy Cassidy Horton, Contributor\\nHow CBDCs Compare To Traditional Currency\\nCBDCs offer the same functions as traditional currency but in a digital format. They can be used for payments, savings and investments, with the added benefits of reduced physical cash handling and improved transaction traceability.\\nMost CBDCs are accessed through a digital wallet on a smartphone or device. Certain implementations of CBDCs like the e-CNY in China also provide for physical offline cards that can be used for contactless transactions, not unlike a traditional credit card. This format is particularly important where digital infrastructure is lacking as it allows for completely offline transactions.\\nCBDCs sit in the middle cash, federal reserves and bank accounts.\\n\\u00a9 Peterson Insitute for International Economics, republished with permission\\nHow CBDCs Compare To Cryptocurrencies\\nUnlike decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Bitcoin , CBDCs are issued and regulated by central banks, ensuring stability and trust. CBDCs aim to combine the benefits of digital currencies with the reliability of traditional financial systems.\\nIn addition, as CBDCs are typically pegged 1:1 with traditional currencies, they don\\u2019t have the volatility that plagues most crypto-currencies as they are designed to be stable representations of traditional currency.\\nTypes of CBDCs\\nCBDCs can either be considered either wholesale or retail CBDCs.\\nRetail CBDCs\\nRetail CBDCs are digital currencies available to the general public. They can be used for everyday transactions, similar to cash or bank deposits. Retail CBDCs aim to enhance financial inclusion by providing a digital payment option accessible to everyone.\\nWholesale CBDCs\\nWholesale CBDCs are intended for financial institutions and are used for interbank settlements and large-value transactions. They improve the efficiency and security of financial transactions between banks.\\nAdvantages of CBDCs\\nFinancial Inclusion\\nOne of the most significant advantages of CBDCs is the potential to enhance financial inclusion. In many parts of the world, a substantial portion of the population remains unbanked or underbanked, lacking access to traditional financial services. CBDCs can help ameliorate this by offering a digital payment method that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status.\\nThis can be particularly impactful in developing countries where banking infrastructure is limited. By enabling direct access to central bank funds, CBDCs can empower individuals and small businesses, fostering economic participation and reducing inequality.\\nReduction In Transaction Costs\\nCBDCs can also significantly reduce transaction costs for both consumers and businesses. Traditional payment systems often involve multiple intermediaries, each adding their own fees to the transaction process. CBDCs streamline this by enabling peer-to-peer transactions directly between parties without the need for intermediaries.\\nThis not only lowers costs but also speeds up transaction times. For businesses, especially those operating on tight margins, the reduction in transaction costs can translate into substantial savings, improving profitability and encouraging more efficient business operations.\\nEnhanced Security\\nSecurity is a critical concern in the digital age, and CBDCs offer enhanced security features compared to traditional cash and current digital payment systems. CBDCs leverage advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and protect against fraud. Unlike physical cash, which can be lost or stolen, digital currencies can be tracked and authenticated, reducing the risk of theft.\\nAdditionally, central banks can implement stringent security protocols and continuous monitoring to detect and prevent cyber threats. This enhanced security framework not only protects individual users but also contributes to the overall stability of the financial system.\\nFaster Transaction Speeds\\nTraditional banking systems can be slow, especially for cross-border transactions, which often take several days to settle. CBDCs can facilitate near-instantaneous transactions, both domestically and internationally. This increased speed can improve cash flow for businesses, reduce waiting times for consumers and enhance the overall efficiency of the financial system. Faster transaction speeds are particularly beneficial in emergency situations where immediate access to funds is crucial.\\nChallenges And Risks Of CBDCs\\nPrivacy Concerns\\nThe implementation of CBDCs raises significant privacy concerns. Unlike cash transactions, which are inherently private, digital transactions can be monitored and tracked by central authorities. This level of surveillance can lead to concerns about the erosion of personal privacy and the potential for misuse of transaction data.\\nFurthermore, the centralization of financial data in a CBDC system could create a single point of failure, making it an attractive target for cybercriminals. Ensuring that robust privacy protections and data security measures are in place will be crucial to addressing these concerns.\\nCybersecurity Threats\\nCBDCs are susceptible to cybersecurity threats, including hacking, digital fraud and other malicious activities. The digital nature of CBDCs means they require advanced security measures to protect against these threats.\\nCentral banks will need to invest heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and continuously update their systems to combat evolving threats. The risk of large-scale cyber attacks poses a significant challenge, as a successful breach could undermine trust in the entire financial system.\\nEconomic Implications\\nThe widespread adoption of CBDCs could disrupt existing financial systems. Traditional banks play a crucial role in the economy by providing loans and other financial services. If consumers and businesses move their deposits from commercial banks to CBDCs, it could reduce the banks' ability to lend, potentially leading to a credit crunch.\\nAdditionally, CBDCs could alter the dynamics of monetary policy. Central banks would have to manage the supply and demand of digital currency carefully to avoid inflation or deflation. The introduction of CBDCs could also impact international financial stability, as countries would need to navigate the complexities of cross-border digital currency transactions.\\nGlobal Adoption Of CBDCs\\nSeveral countries are at the forefront of CBDC adoption, each exploring different models and approaches. China, for example, has made significant strides with its e-CNY, and after conducting extensive pilot programs in major cities, the digital currency is now live across the country and increasingly overseas. These initiatives aim to modernize payment systems, enhance financial inclusion and increase the efficiency of transactions.\\nSimilarly, Sweden is testing the e-krona as part of its efforts to reduce the reliance on physical cash. These pilot programs provide valuable insights into the practical applications of CBDCs and highlight the benefits and challenges of digital currencies.\\nOther countries, such as the Bahamas with its Sand Dollar and Nigeria with its eNaira, have also launch[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521923005471\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nCentral bank digital currencies: A critical review - ScienceDirect\\nSkip to main contentSkip to article\\n\\n\\n\\nJournals & Books\\n\\n\\nHelp\\n\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n\\nMy account\\nSign in\\n\\nView\\u00a0PDF\\nDownload full issue\\n\\nSearch ScienceDirect\\n\\nInternational Review of Financial Analysis\\nVolume 91, January 2024, 103031\\n\\nCentral bank digital currencies: A critical review\\nAuthor links open overlay panelLambis Dionysopoulos, Miriam Marra, Andrew Urquhart\\nShow more\\nAdd to Mendeley\\nShare\\nCite\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.irfa.2023.103031Get rights and content\\nUnder a Creative Commons license\\nopen access\\nHighlights\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nWe provide a critical literature survey of CBDCs.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nWe discuss the motivations as well as their various designs.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nWe review arguments laid out on the implications their introduction will cause.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nWe identify sub-areas of CBDC research that need further study.\\n\\n\\nAbstract\\nThis critical literature survey offers a comprehensive understanding of the key aspects and implications of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a rapidly evolving area of academic and policy research.

Our key focus is on whether and how a CBDC could improve on an already safe and efficient U.S. domestic payments system.\\n\\nCBDC is generally defined as a digital liability of a central bank that is widely available to the general public. Today in the United States, Federal Reserve notes (i.e., physical currency) are the only type of central bank money available to the general public. Like existing forms of money, a CBDC would enable the general public to make digital payments. As a liability of the Federal Reserve, however, a CBDC would be the safest digital asset available to the general public, with no associated credit or liquidity risk.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve Board has issued a discussion paper that examines the pros and cons of a potential U.S. CBDC. As part of this process, we sought public feedback on a range of topics related to CBDC.

Adapt to a digital financial ecosystem shaping the next era of finance.\\n\\nIn the dynamic realm of finance, where change is the only constant, a transformative force is quietly reshaping the traditional contours of banking. Enter the era of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a paradigm shift that is fundamentally altering the way we perceive, interact with, and benefit from our financial systems. As we bid farewell to the familiar landscape of brick-and-mortar banking, we find ourselves standing at the crossroads of tradition and innovation, ready to unravel the profound impact CBDCs are set to have on the future of banking and the broader financial ecosystem.\\n\\nIn the tapestry of financial history, the traditional banking system has long been the guardian of our monetary affairs, its foundations rooted in physical institutions and tangible currency. But now, the stage is set for a grand performance where CBDCs take center stage, marking a departure from the traditional script and propelling us into the uncharted territories of a digital financial ecosystem.\\n\\nAs we delve into this exploration, we\\u2019ll first glance over the familiar landscape of traditional banking. From the local bank branch to the tangible feel of cash in hand, the traditional system has been a reliable companion on our financial journeys. Yet, as the digital winds of change sweep through, CBDCs emerge as key protagonists, ushering in an era where transactions are not just digital but represent a fundamental reimagining of how we engage with money.\\n\\nOur journey unfolds with a simple yet powerful realization: the future of banking is no longer confined to physical vaults and paper trails; it\\u2019s a dynamic landscape where bits and bytes replace bricks and mortar. The emergence of CBDCs acts as a catalyst, prompting us to explore not just the technological advancements but the societal and economic shifts that accompany this digital revolution.\\n\\nIn the chapters that follow, we\\u2019ll unravel the layers of CBDCs and their impact on the financial ecosystem, deciphering the opportunities, challenges, and transformative potential they bring. The landscape is evolving, and understanding this evolution is not merely a choice but a necessity for anyone navigating the currents of the modern financial world.\\n\\nSo, join me as we embark on this riveting journey into the heart of digital banking, where CBDCs hold the key to unlocking a future that is not just digital but a testament to adaptability, innovation, and the continuous evolution of our financial narratives. Welcome to the exploration of CBDCs and the Future of Banking \\u2014 a journey into the digital heartbeat of our financial future.\\n\\nUnlocking the Cipher of CBDCs: A Journey into Digital Currency Dynamics\\n\\nIn the digital age, where every tap and click resonates in the vast expanse of cyberspace, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) stand as keystones, poised to reshape the very essence of how we conceive and engage with money. Join us as we embark on an odyssey of understanding, decrypting the intricate code that is CBDCs.\\n\\nDefinition and Basic Concepts of CBDCs: Navigating the Digital Financial Frontier\\n\\nAt its most fundamental level, a CBDC is the offspring of traditional currency and digital innovation, a digital representation of a nation\\u2019s monetary unit backed and regulated by its central bank. Gone are the days of tangible bills and metallic coins; CBDCs usher in a new era where currency is no longer confined to the physical realm but seamlessly integrated into the digital landscape. Picture your wallet transformed into pixels, with CBDCs in digital wallets accessible at the tap of a screen. The core concept revolves around convenience, accessibility, and the digital evolution of our monetary systems.\\n\\nDifferent Types of CBDCs: Retail vs. Wholesale\\n\\nNot all CBDCs are created equal. Enter the Retail CBDC, the digital currency crafted for the everyday consumer. It\\u2019s the currency you use for your morning coffee, online shopping sprees, and dinner outings. Contrastingly, Wholesale CBDCs cater to the financial behemoths, facilitating large-scale transactions between banks and financial institutions. Think of it as the backstage pass that enables the seamless flow of funds in the vast theater of financial operations. Understanding these distinctions is akin to deciphering the unique roles each type plays in the grand symphony of the digital financial orchestra.\\n\\nHistorical Context and Evolution Leading to the Development of CBDCs: Tracing the Digital Footprints\\n\\nThe emergence of CBDCs is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of a digital evolution that has been in motion for decades. Rewind to the era of electronic banking, the first whispers of a cashless society. As technology advanced, so did the idea of a digital currency backed by the central authority. CBDCs represent the contemporary zenith of this journey, a response to the technological zeitgeist and the changing dynamics of global finance. Understanding the historical context is like tracing the digital footprints that have led us to the brink of a cash-to-code metamorphosis.\\n\\nIn deciphering the cipher of CBDCs, we unravel not just a digital currency but the fabric of a future where financial landscapes are redefined. These definitions, types, and historical insights serve as the compass, guiding us through the uncharted territories of a financial future marked by the transformative potential of Central Bank Digital Currencies.\\n\\nKey Features and Benefits of CBDCs\\n\\nAs we navigate the digital frontier ushered in by Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), it becomes paramount to decipher not just their definition but the transformative features and benefits they bring to the financial table. Picture a world where transactions are not only digital but executed with unprecedented efficiency, where financial inclusion is more than a buzzword, and the specter of fraud and illicit activities is minimized. CBDCs emerge not only as a technological upgrade but as architects of a financial utopia.\\n\\nOne of the symphonic movements orchestrated by CBDCs is the increased efficiency in payments and settlements. Imagine a world where transactions are executed with the speed of thought, where the delays of traditional banking systems are replaced by seamless digital transactions. CBDCs cut through the red tape, offering a real-time, 24/7 payment infrastructure that not only benefits consumers but transforms the landscape for businesses and financial institutions. It\\u2019s a swift, harmonious symphony of digital transactions where time is no longer a barrier\\n\\n2. Enhanced Financial Inclusion and Accessibility\\n\\nCBDCs hold the promise of being the great equalizer in the financial realm, fostering enhanced financial inclusion and accessibility. In a world where geographical distances and socio-economic barriers often restrict access to traditional banking, CBDCs extend a digital olive branch. They provide a gateway for the unbanked and underbanked populations to step into the financial fold, offering them a chance to participate in the global economy. It\\u2019s not just about digital currency; it\\u2019s about building bridges to financial opportunities previously out of reach\\n\\n3. Potential for Reduced Fraud and Illicit Activities\\n\\nIn the digital age, where the flow of money intersects with the lurking shadows of fraud and illicit activities, CBDCs emerge as sentinels, fortifying the digital fortress of financial systems. The transparent nature of blockchain technology, often the backbone of CBDCs, enhances traceability and accountability in transactions. This, coupled with robust security measures, has the potential to significantly minimize fraud and illicit financial activities. CBDCs don\\u2019t just offer convenience; they usher in a new era of financial integrity.\\n\\nIt becomes evident that these digital currencies are not merely disruptors; they are architects of a financial ecosystem where efficiency, inclusion, and security converge to shape a future that transcends the limitations of traditional finance.\\n\\nChallenges and Concerns Surrounding CBDCs\\n\\nAs Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) take center stage in the unfolding drama of financial evolution, it\\u2019s imperative to cast a discerning eye on the challenges and concerns that accompany their ascent. While CBDCs promise a multitude of benefits, they also cast shadows that demand our attention and scrutiny. From the delicate dance between privacy and security considerations to the ripple effects on commercial banks and monetary policies, and the prevailing skepticism echoing through the public sphere, CBDCs tread a path that requires careful navigation through the intricacies of the digital revolution.\\n\\nIn a world where data is both currency and vulnerability, the introduction of CBDCs raises pertinent questions about privacy and security. The transparency of blockchain, the technology often underpinning CBDCs, is a double-edged sword. While it ensures traceability and accountability, concerns arise about the potential compromise of user privacy. Striking the delicate balance between transparency and individual privacy is a challenge that policymakers and technologists must grapple with to ensure the integrity of CBDCs as a secure and private digital medium.\\n\\n2. Impact on Commercial Banks and Monetary Policy: Winds of Change in Traditional Banking\\n\\nAs CBDCs gain traction, the financial landscape stands on the precipice of transformation, prompting concerns about their impact on commercial banks and established monetary policies. The digitization of currency challenges the traditional role of banks as intermediaries, potentially altering the dynamics of lending, interest rates, and money supply. Adapting to this n[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.bis.org/fsi/fsisummaries/cbdcs.htm\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nCentral bank digital currencies \\u2013 Executive Summary\\n\\nToday, money exists in two forms. Public money is issued by a central bank via banknotes and central bank reserves, while private money is issued by commercial banks in the form of deposits and non-bank financial institutions in the form of electronic money (e-money). Banknotes are the only form of public money available to the general public. Banks, in contrast, also have access to public money in electronic form, via central bank reserves.\\n\\nThe only digital money to which the general public currently has access is issued by commercial banks or e-money issuers. As a liability on their balance sheets, such money carries the credit risk of its issuer. In contrast, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are a direct liability of the central bank and as such do not carry any credit risk.\\n\\nThere are two types of CBDC. Retail CBDCs (rCBDCs) are intended for the general public, aiming to provide a risk-free and digital means of payment for everyday transactions. Wholesale CBDCs (wCBDCs), on the other hand, are designed for use among financial intermediaries and operate like central bank reserves but with added functionalities enabled by tokenisation.1\\n\\nBenefits and challenges\\n\\nA risk-free, digital and programmable means of payment can offer a range of benefits:\\n\\nIntroducing rCBDCs may come with challenges. Key among those are the following:\\n\\nApproaches to mitigating these risks include caps to CBDC holdings, remuneration policies that imply a premium for commercial bank money and robust data governance regimes.\\n\\nArchitecture\\n\\nIntroducing CBDCs requires an adjusted division of labour between the central bank and providers of private money in respect of execution and recording of payments and client servicing. In that regard, three models have emerged:\\n\\nAssessing the merits of each approach is an area of ongoing research. A key design choice is whether a CBDC should rely on a trusted central authority to maintain the transactions ledger, or whether it should be based on a platform with decentralised governance as provided by distributed ledger technology (DLT).3\\n\\nCross-border aspects\\n\\nInternational cooperation is required to allow for the cross-border use of CBDCs. A challenge in that regard is the use of a digital identity (digital ID) outside the country of origin. Overcoming this challenge by working towards a supranational digital ID does not appear to be realistic. Instead, international efforts towards mutually recognising national ID credentials are a more promising approach.4\\n\\nThis approach includes work on (i) strengthening KYC rules and sharing information on identity across borders; (ii) reviewing the interaction between data frameworks and cross-border payments; and (iii) reflecting cross-border usage in CBDC designs. A way to achieve these objectives is through multi-CBDC (mCBDC) arrangements, which coordinate national CBDCs. Three models for mCBDC arrangements have been identified:\\n\\n1 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Tokenisation is the process of representing claims, eg for money, digitally on a programmable platform. As tokenised assets, CBDCs could be programmed for automatic transfer if certain conditions are met. See the BIS AER 2023 for more on tokenisation.\\n\\n2 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 This is referred to as atomic settlement because the legs of a transaction cannot be split.\\n\\n3 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 DLT enables nodes in a network to securely propose, validate and record changes or updates to a synchronised ledger that is distributed across the network's nodes.\\n\\n4 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 See the G20 roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments.\\n\\nThis Executive Summary and related tutorials are also available in FSI Connect, the online learning tool of the Bank for International Settlements.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies: HTTP 403: Forbidden\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-future-banking-cbdcs-amb-prof-bitange-ndemo/\\nTitle: Exploring the future of banking with CBDCs\\nContent:\\nContrary to the beliefs of sceptics, the development and adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is an inevitable shift already underway. This transformation is driven by changing business models and the increasing preference for alternative modes of payment over traditional cash. Reports from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) affirm this trend and shed light on the ongoing efforts to shape the future of finance.\\nCentral banks from various countries, including Canada, the European Union, Japan, Switzerland, England, Sweden, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Bank for International Settlements, play a crucial role in developing thefoundational principles and core featuresof CBDCs. These institutions have conducted extensive research and produced valuable reports on key aspects of CBDC implementation.\\nReports onSystems Design and Interoperability,user needs and adoption, andfinancial stability implicationsprovide essential insights into the potential opportunities and challenges associated with CBDCs. They acknowledge that the evolution of money is inevitable given the increasing digitalization of economies, rapidly changing user needs and the transformative impact of innovation on financial services.\\nFurthermore, the use of cash for transactions is declining in many jurisdictions, while non-bank private sector entities are introducing new forms of digital money, such as stablecoins. These developments highlight the need for central banks to adapt and explore how they can fulfil their public policy objectives in a rapidly changing financial landscape.\\nHowever, it is worth noting that while preparations for CBDCs are underway in the global north, discussions and plans for adopting digital currencies in the south are still frozen. This disparity could lead to capacity issues and challenges for countries in the south as they try to catch up with the rest of the world during CBDC adoption.\\nIn conclusion, the shift towards CBDCs is a reality that cannot be ignored. Central banks and international organizations are diligently working to shape the future of finance by laying the groundwork for CBDC implementation. The reports and research being produced highlight both the potential opportunities and challenges, reaffirming that the evolution of money is an inevitable and necessary response to the changing dynamics of our digital economies. However, addressing the potential disparities and ensuring a more inclusive and coordinated approach to adopting CBDCs worldwide is crucial.\\nThe writer is Kenya\\u2019s Ambassador to Belgium, Mission to the European Union, Organization of African Caribbean and Pacific States and World Customs Organization. The article is written at a personal level.\\nCreation addict\\nAt times it feels as if these developments are just to fill the hunger for control. Order may be needed, but this may not necessarily be filled in by governments/central banks. A single base unit for ease of valuation may be needed, but only as a reference-tool. If central banks feel they need some form of control, at least let them agree on a universal adoption of a single cbdc. It would be good if such a currency is backed by assets rather than govt guarantees.\\nManaging Director at Privvycon Limited\\nWith what we're seeing in China. Wouldn't it be prudent to be cautious of the kind of control that governments through Central banks will hold over the populace?\\nThe Wise Realizes His Ignorance - Thomas Sowell\\nCBDCs do not solve the persistent issue of fluctuating exchange rates between state currencies. Instead, we should consider adopting a single international scientific unit as a currency, such as kWh (kiloWatt-hour), where 1 coin equals 1 kWh. This would alleviate poverty while we should also be addressing land distribution and reducing global population in a positive manner. The Western countries' significant pollution has resulted in over 50% of males being unable to father children. Rather than being offended, we should accept this as a consequence. Personally, if I reach a point where I cannot care for myself and have no one, not even an Elon Musk robot, to assist me, I would prefer to pass away, expressing thankful gratitude to the world and the people who made my time here wonderful. While we are at it - significantly important in line with CBDC is - to plant trees. I have planted around 400 trees in the most recent 12 years. We should all plant some trees every year. 10, 15, 20 - but plant them. Maintain them until they are 3-4 meters tall, then they can take care of themselves. Plant where no trees are...\\nThe Wise Realizes His Ignorance - Thomas Sowell\\nAlso inevitable are the new upcoming digital stable coins. We do not see many of these as they are not profit making for the owner or maker of it, they are rather international currencies. I am participating in one network of corporations creating such a stable coin around energy. It will become yet a new dawn for stablecoins as this one here is even more boring than the rest as it cannot even inflate, which is the last bastion for making cash out of cash. Seemingly uninteresting it may become a coin for the masses as it will work directly contradictory to any CBDC or usual coin in that it will maintain it's value no matter what happens in the market. It can therefore not become speculated against as anyone \\\"investing\\\" in it will inevitably lose out, while any consumer holding on to it will be protected exactly against the very same inflation. So. While indeed CBDC will happen, this other trend will provide a bastion to cling on to for billions of people world wide. This may over time when it become wide spread, therefore totally undermine the forever inflationing national currencies, even though it will neither provide us not anyone else with any financial benefits.

        "value": "The introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is poised to significantly impact the traditional banking system and financial stability over the next five years. This potential impact can be analyzed through various aspects.\n\n### 1. **Transformation of the Banking Landscape**\nCBDCs could alter the role of commercial banks in the financial ecosystem. As CBDCs are direct liabilities of central banks, they offer consumers a risk-free option for digital transactions, which may lead to a shift away from traditional bank deposits. If individuals increasingly hold CBDCs instead of bank deposits, it could reduce the funds available for banks to lend, potentially causing a credit crunch. This shift could challenge banks\u2019 traditional role as intermediaries and impact their profitability, given that a significant portion of their income comes from interest on loans. Consequently, banks may need to adapt their business models to maintain relevance in a digital finance landscape where customers favor CBDCs for safety and convenience.\n\n### 2. **Financial Stability Concerns**\nThe widespread adoption of CBDCs presents certain financial stability risks. As consumers can instantly shift their assets into CBDCs, during financial stress or banking crises, this could lead to rapid outflows from commercial banks, destabilizing them. This phenomenon would create pressure on liquidity and potentially exacerbate existing vulnerabilities within the banking sector. Policymakers and regulators need to carefully monitor and manage these transitions to mitigate systemic risks.\n\n### 3. **Monetary Policy Implications**\nCBDCs may also influence how central banks implement monetary policy. Direct access to a national digital currency could complicate the management of the money supply and interest rates, as central banks would need to balance the demand for CBDCs against traditional forms of money. There is a concern that if CBDCs become too popular, central banks might face challenges controlling inflation and executing effective monetary policy. The introduction of CBDCs may necessitate new frameworks for monetary policy that accommodate the unique characteristics of digital currencies.\n\n### 4. **Enhanced Financial Inclusion**\nOn the positive side, CBDCs have the potential to enhance financial inclusion. With the capability to provide digital payment methods accessible to unbanked and underbanked populations, CBDCs could enable greater participation in the economy. This could foster economic stability in the long run by integrating more individuals into the financial system, increasing the overall resilience of the economy.\n\n### 5. **Cybersecurity and Privacy Challenges**\nAs CBDCs become part of the financial system, issues related to cybersecurity and privacy will also emerge. The implementation of CBDCs may raise concerns over the centralization of financial data and the potential for surveillance by Central Banks. Ensuring robust cybersecurity measures will be crucial to maintain public trust and protect the financial system from cyber threats. Additionally, striking a balance between transaction traceability for fraud prevention and individual privacy will be vital.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the next five years will likely see significant shifts driven by the implementation of CBDCs, affecting traditional banking operations, financial stability, and monetary policy dynamics. The balance between leveraging the benefits of CBDCs\u2014such as efficiency and inclusivity\u2014and addressing the risks they introduce will be pivotal for policymakers and the financial industry as a whole. As this landscape evolves, continuous research and adaptation will be essential in navigating the complexities of a digital currency-driven economy."

Besides the functional monetary policy improvements purported by macro policy and financial stability research, most of the expected benefits of introducing CBDCs need more evidence to make a winning case for central bank digital currencies. Alternative literature partly focuses on the practical results from regulatory preparations and adoption challenges, while some scholars study relevant historical arguments for CBDCs. The socioeconomic impact of the digitalization of money, currency competition between private and public money, and direct access to central bank liabilities are vital themes that researchers focus on to bridge past research with the recent rise of digital currencies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Central bank digital currency (CBDC) information security and ...\\nURL: https://www.bis.org/publ/othp81.htm\\nCONTENT: Central bank digital currency (CBDC) information security and operational risks to central banks Central bank digital currency (CBDC) information security and operational risks to central banks Introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) will have far-reaching implications for the operations of the issuing central bank and the risk it faces.

These protections are built upon select security and operational frameworks that guide system operators through risk assessments and the subsequent implementation of security controls based on the sensitivity of the data stored on the information system. The shared ownership and distributed character of a DLT-based CBDC mean that system responsibilities would not fall to one particular operator, and therefore, the implementation of security practices derived from frameworks like those highlighted in this note may benefit from institutional and end-user coordination, as well as the use of shared standards.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: PDF\\nURL: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2023072pap.pdf\\nCONTENT: Indeed, banks play a crucial role in today\\u2019s financial system, in part due to their ability to create liquid-ity through maturity transformation\\u2014i.e., by financing long-maturity assets with short-term liabilities.8 The economies of scope\\u2014or synergies\\u2014that arise from combining lending and deposit-taking activities give banks a natural advantage in providing liquidity (Acharya and Mora, 2015), protecting firms and households against idiosyncratic and systemic liquidity shocks (Gatev and Strahan, 2006, Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein, 2002), and thereby promoting economic growth (Bencivenga and Smith, 1991, Berger and Sedunov, 2017).9 To illustrate how issuing a retail CBDC could affect banks and the broader financial system, we start with a picture of the financial system as a chain of assets and liabilities.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[9]:\\nTITLE: PDF\\nURL: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2024021pap.pdf\\nCONTENT: 28 Tool Type of tool Effect on run incentives Potential Adverse Side effects Tiered Remuneration Price tool Discourage flight-to-safety for moderate stress levels Discourage use of CBDC as a medium of exchange during a crisis if not implemented properly Access limits Quantity tool Reduce risk of runs originating from the entities on which the restrictions are placed Harm the medium of exchange role of CBDC, increase the incentives for regulatory arbitrage Transaction size limits Quantity tool Discourage flight-to-safety for moderate stress levels Discourage use of CBDC as a medium of exchange if not implemented properly Holding limits Quantity tool Prevent hoarding of CBDC above the limits in all instances Ineffective if the limit is not chosen adequately for different entities; regulatory arbitrage; amplification of runs if set at aggregate level Convertibility limits Quantity tool Stop a run if their implementation is unanticipated Pre-emptive runs; multiple secondary markets for CBDC Table 2: Tools to Mitigate Flight-to-CBDC We study the ability of each potential tool to mitigate harmful runs on financial institutions during times of crisis.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nQuery: examples of countries implementing CBDCs and outcomes\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: CBDC - Central Bank Digital Currency - Vajiram & Ravi\\nURL: https://vajiramandravi.com/quest-upsc-notes/central-bank-digital-currency/\\nCONTENT: As countries like the Bahamas, China, and India have begun piloting or implementing CBDCs, global adoption is steadily growing.

There is an urgent need to clarify aspects such as consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorism financing within the context of CBDCs. In Africa, many countries face similar challenges in developing adequate legal and regulatory frameworks for CBDCs, often due to a lack of capacity and expertise in financial technology and digital currency regulation. To achieve successful CBDC implementation in developing countries, a strategic and holistic approach is needed that includes building public trust, investing in infrastructure, establishing clear legal frameworks, mitigating the impact on the financial sector, addressing socio-economic barriers, and ensuring strong privacy protection.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Snapshot: Which countries have made the most progress on CBDCs so far ...\\nURL: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/which-countries-have-made-the-most-progress-in-cbdcs-so-far-in-2023/\\nCONTENT: To dive deeper into these countries, follow our CBDC tracker, where we track and update developments in 119 countries, representing more than 95 percent of the world's GDP.

Central bank digital currency (CBDC) was developed to improve payment convenience, boost security, foster financial innovation, and safeguard the overall stability of financial systems (Hoque, Billah, Alam, & Lucey, 2024; Wang, Ma, & Ren, 2022). This study proposes a comprehensive financial regulatory framework that integrates privacy-preserving techniques and blockchain technology to address the challenges of the modern digital economy. Specifically, under our proposed framework, financial institutions can calculate financial regulatory indicators without disclosing sensitive data, which can help regulators to accurately understand the operation and status of financial markets using blockchain technology to achieve distributed computing and intelligent data transmission.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: How the Legal Framework for CBDCs Work? - Ruedex\\nURL: https://rue-dex.com/understanding-the-legal-framework-for-cbdcs/\\nCONTENT: 1.

To support the infrastructure needs of a Central Bank Digital Currency, it must be interoperable with other forms of money and existing payment systems. Given the claim that a Central Bank Digital Currency would give the government the potential to monitor and control transactions, how should anti money laundering legislation evolve? Laws must also address the programmability of digital currencies, to avoid ambiguity between cryptocurrencies and CBDCs. The issuing of money is central to any economy, and the potential of systemic risk of a CBDC has to be considered.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: CBDC Canada: What Is It? - Forbes Advisor Canada\\nURL: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/ca/investing/cryptocurrency/cbdc-what-is-it/\\nCONTENT: No concrete plan for issuing a CBDC in Canada has been put forward, so no solid regulatory framework has been established.

As digital versions of fiat currencies, CBDCs are poised to create a ripple effect on international financial systems, posing complex challenges related to cryptocurrency technology and regulation. China and Russia have pursued a more centralized approach towards digital currencies, banning or heavily restricting cryptocurrencies while supporting state-controlled CBDCs. These countries view CBDCs as tools for digitizing their economies and exerting control over transaction data, which is crucial for implementing effective monetary policies.

Financial privacy protection may be jeopardized if CBDCs are implemented in a fashion that permits central authorities to track and gather information on all transactions. Ultimately, how much privacy CBDCs provide will also depend on how well-informed users are about privacy concerns and how much control they have over their own data. Additional concerns include malware and ransomware, which can infect users\\u2019 devices, compromise CBDC transactions or demand ransom payments in CBDCs.

These attributes enable CBDC to serve as effective tools for the calibration of national monetary policies, consequently improving the precision and efficacy of monetary policy transmission mechanisms (Lee et al., 2021) and ensuring stability within the macroeconomic framework. For instance, numerous scholars have explored the effects of CBDC on household budget constraints (Agur et al., 2022), output (Bindseil, 2019; Barrdear and Kumhof, 2022), payment systems (Bech et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2021), the banking system (Keister and Sanches, 2023; Kim and Kwon, 2023), monetary policy transmission (Lee et al., 2021), and financial system stability (Greenwood et al., 2016; Stevens, 2017; Bindseil, 2019).\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: PDF\\nURL: https://ijrar.org/papers/IJRAR23C3267.pdf\\nCONTENT: on introducing a CBDC following the enactment of relevant legislation.

This paper enriches the existing literature in several key ways: firstly, by linking the issuance of CBDCs to corporate financing, it addresses a significant gap in both business-level literature and empirical studies about CBDCs. Secondly, it delves into the effects of CBDCs on enterprise financing through variables such as bank lending rates, the scope of credit, and the ease of accessing finance, thereby offering new insights into the corporate financial landscape following the issuance of CBDCs.

Thus, the interest rate channel would be strengthened, as interest rates on savings and credit would either shift by more, 61 Traditionally, several channels of monetary policy transmission have been discussed in the literature, including the following: the interest rate channel (Mishkin, 1995), the credit channel (Bernanke and Blinder, 1988; Bernanke and Gertler, 1995; Gilchrist and Zakraj\\u0161ek, 2012), the bank lending channel (Kashyap and Stein, 1995, 2000; Stein, 1998), the bank balance sheet channel (Van den Huevel, 2002; Lenel et al., 2019), and the deposits channel (Drechsler et al., 2017).\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[10]:\\nTITLE: IMF's Take On CBDCs: Balance Sheet Analysis And Policy Choices - Forbes\\nURL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/11/06/ifms-take-on-cbdcs-balance-sheet-analysis-and-policy-choices/\\nCONTENT: As central banks all over the world are exploring the potential benefits of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published October 11 2024, a report evaluating the financial stability implications of the issuance of CBDCs.

The IMF Working Paper authored by Romain Bouis, Gaston Gelos, Paavo Miettinen, Fumitaka Nakamura, Erlend Nier, and Gabriel Soderberg, from the International Monetary Fund\\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets department, examines the implications of retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on financial stability. The authors highlight that the financial stability effects of CBDCs depend on several key factors, including the size of the issuance, the initial conditions of the financial system, and how both banks and central banks react. One of the central concerns raised in the paper is that the issuance of CBDCs could lead to disruptions in the traditional banking system, particularly in terms of financial intermediation.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: The Ripple Effect of CBDCs on Bank Lending and Profitability\\nURL: https://ncfacanada.org/the-ripple-effect-of-cbdcs-on-bank-lending-and-profitability/\\nCONTENT: If the benefits are more like putting money in a bank, it should be less private.

Impact of Digital Currencies on Traditional Banking Digital currencies tend to alter the traditional banking model because they have alternative possibilities, which can gradually reduce the demand for intermediate players like banks and thus make for more efficient, low-cost transactions in a changing traditional financial business process.

This article will explore the impact of CBDCs on banks and analyze potential challenges and opportunities. CBDCs are digital fiat currencies that central banks issue on a centralized blockchain network. Central banks can significantly reduce the traditional role of banks as intermediaries by providing CBDCs directly to consumers and businesses. Central banks bear the responsibility of implementing and managing CBDCs. This transition represents a significant operational shift for central banks, requiring them to effectively adapt their processes and systems to accommodate digital currencies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: CBDC and banking stability: Modeling cascading effects on reserves ...\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090944324000693\\nCONTENT: It is based on this observation that this article aims to analyse the potential impact of the introduction of CBDCs on the banking system, with a focus on the effects of excess confidence in CBDCs, the effects of covering each CBDC issuance with mandatory reserves in fiat currency, the effects of higher interest rates in the context of CBDC issuance, and the effects of rapid growth in the creation of scriptural money in the context of CBDCs.

In addition to these operational considerations, the broader impact on financial intermediation activity is an important consideration in assessing the economic impact of CBDCs. Just like cash, CBDCs can be designed to maximise usefulness in payments, without giving rise to large inflows onto the central bank's balance sheet.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: CBDCs will further fragment the global economy\\u2014and could threaten the ...\\nURL: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/cbdcs-will-further-fragment-the-global-economy-and-could-threaten-the-dollar/\\nCONTENT: China Digital Currencies Economy & Business Europe & Eurasia International Markets United States and Canada By the time the final report regarding the Project Cedar experiment had been published in May 2023, the policy landscape in the United States regarding digital currencies had shifted significantly.

There is an urgent need to clarify aspects such as consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorism financing within the context of CBDCs. In Africa, many countries face similar challenges in developing adequate legal and regulatory frameworks for CBDCs, often due to a lack of capacity and expertise in financial technology and digital currency regulation. To achieve successful CBDC implementation in developing countries, a strategic and holistic approach is needed that includes building public trust, investing in infrastructure, establishing clear legal frameworks, mitigating the impact on the financial sector, addressing socio-economic barriers, and ensuring strong privacy protection.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: CBDCs: Key Regulatory Considerations & Effective Implementation Strategies\\nURL: https://hakia.com/central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdcs-regulatory-considerations-and-implementation/\\nCONTENT: As you look into the regulatory landscape surrounding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), it becomes clear that several critical components must be considered to ensure their successful implementation.

By representing a country\\u2019s noble currency in digital form and issuing them as central bank money, CBDCs can greatly increase financial inclusion, facilitate transactions and improve payment efficiency and provide concrete authority for monetary policy implementation. They could also pose several questions about banking itself, financial stability, and even the role of private sector financial institutions. This article traces the effects of CBDCs on banking, investigating their merits, potential challenges, and the possible restructuring of their financial ecosystem.\\n\\nComprehending Central Bank Digital Currencies\\n\\nUnlike digital coins like Bitcoin, the CBDCs are state-aided and regulated. Far beyond the conventional decentralized cryptocurrencies, and unlike coins that are not based on anything and independent of the governments, a CBDC is issued and controlled by a central bank, ensuring complete support, reliability, and proper management. This becomes manifest in the two categories that:\\n\\nIn various countries, the governments and central banks, including the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the People\\u2019s Bank of China, are conducting research into, or issuing pilot programs for, CBDCs with a view to modernizing financial systems and enhancing economic efficiency. Using cutting-edge technologies, CBDCs could transform payment processes, cut transaction costs, and improve transparency in financial transactions.\\n\\nAdvantages of CBDCs for Banks\\n\\n1. Improvement of Payment Systems\\n\\nCBDCs are expected to improve the working of payment infrastructure by minimizing the dependency on intermediaries. They facilitate real-time processing of transactions at lower fees; thus, delays related to conventional banking networks are minimized. For another thing, it can improve the efficiency of cross-border payment and reduce transaction costs and settlement times. Coupled with the digital payments system in which CBDCs are embedded, the government\\u2019s businesses can take advantage of doing faster and cheaper transactions that would create an impetus for economic growth while scaling back the use of traditional, cash-based transactions.\\n\\n2. Economic Participation\\n\\nCBDCs directly cater to mobile users\\u2019 needs and, therefore, generally provide unbanked populations with access to banking services. CBDC thereby closes the financial gap developing economies are facing against a backdrop of poor traditional banking infrastructure and, therefore, encourages participation in the economy.\\n\\nWith the CBDCs safely providing an alternative to government-approved digital wallets, access to financial services, especially in remote or underserved areas, can be facilitated. In doing this inclusively, they create economic stability and provide more opportunities for people to work.\\n\\n3. Intensified Implementation of Monetary Policy Improvement\\n\\nCBDC praises its central banks with the potential motive to improve an effective monetary policy transmission system; for example, negative interest rates may be easily applied as a direct manipulation of digital currency holdings. Such an approach could be significant for the tackling of economic recessions. CBDCs further differ from conventional arrangements as they will allow central banks to trace spending patterns and economic tendencies more accurately, thus making policies based more on data and dynamically responsive to economic fluctuation but also stabilizing it.\\n\\n4. Decrease Costs and Fraud\\n\\nThe operational costs associated with cash printing, distribution, and security are reduced by using CBDCs. Digital transactions leave an audit trail, thus making illicit financial activities like money laundering and tax theft very tedious to perform. Money-saving by businesses and governments will be due to a reduced handling of cash, along with increasing transaction security. Digital traceability will ensure that all financial transactions are transparent as well as strengthen the regulatory oversight. It will also discourage any fraudulent activities in the financial system.\\n\\nThe Challenges CBDCs Pose to Traditional Banking\\n\\n1. Disintermediation of Commercial Banks\\n\\nSuch threats as deleveraging from commercial banks are strong influences of CBDC. A possible example would be that individuals and firms start preferring to hold their CBDC balances directly with the central bank rather than through commercial banks/wallets. In such a scenario, commercial banks are deprived of deposits, limited by a decrease in lending, and find themselves with liquidity-short matched assets, triggering a search for alternative means to mobilize resources (e.g., issuing bonds or relying on wholesale funding) to cover the short-run liquidity misalignment because they are likely to seek a higher cost of funds due to competition with retail holders for funding. Such a combination of measures ultimately raises the costs associated with their activities and diminishes profitability. Banks must then innovate by improving the intrinsic value of services offered, creating additional value to prevent the mass exodus of customers to CBDC.\\n\\n2. Effect on Interest Rates and Credit Accessibility\\n\\nThe transition from commercial bank funds into central bank digital currency (CBDC) accounts could severely disrupt banks\\u2019 loan issuance capabilities. Deposits from clients are the banks\\u2019 lifeblood for lending, and should a sufficient volume of these deposits shift to CBDCs, it is quite likely that banks will be compelled to raise deposit interest rates, thereby resulting in higher borrowing costs. Economic activities may see a reduction in borrowings by both the businesses and consumers. Banks could therefore change their lending paradigm based on proper risk management strategies focussing on sustainability in an environment that is suddenly characterized by changeable deposit levels.\\n\\n3. Cybersecurity Risks and Privacy Concerns\\n\\nCBDC brings a robust risk with regards to cybersecurity when assets become the prime target of attacks by hackers. Furthermore, centralized digital currencies create alarm over government surveillance and privacy of data whereby, in real-time, central banks could have control or keep record of financial transactions; most importantly, invasion in the infrastructure of CBDC will create a worldwide shock of financial instability that will have an impact on millions of users.Governments and financial institutions will have to set up well-structured mechanisms of robust encryption, fraud detection, and cyber defenses in order to safeguard their systems against threats. Strong regulations and the trust of the public at the time of CBDC implementation will also be determining factors to strike a balance between keeping the appropriate level of privacy and ensuring security.\\n\\n4. Cross-Border Implications and Regulatory Challenges\\n\\nInternational boundaries are set for cross border implications and regulatory challenges. What are the challenges with CBDC for global financial stability? In the future, countries will have to have regulatory frameworks for handling cross-border transactions, preventing illicit financial flows, and interoperating different CBDC systems. Once again, it will require the work of central banks to avoid currency manipulation and make international trade smooth. Issue relating to legality in the use of CBDCs in foreign territories will have to be resolved to avoid possible disputes and ensure that global networks continue to function within international regulations.\\n\\nHow Banks Can Adapt to the CBDC Age\\n\\n1. Embracing The Digital Innovativeness\\n\\nFor commercial banks to keep up with times, they must embark on a digital transformation to provide more competitive financial products and services, improve current technology by integrating blockchain, fortifying cybersecurity, and utilizing artificial intelligence in provision for the sharpening competitive edge. They need to upgrade the legacy systems, install real-time payments, and allow API integration so that they are positioned for agility in an increasingly digitalized financial ecosystem. Even industries outside of finance, such as event photographers, are leveraging digital transformation to streamline operations and enhance client experiences, highlighting the widespread impact of technological advancements.\\n\\n2. Developing Hybrid Financial Models\\n\\nThe laboratories of banks and central banks can concoct hybrid financial models whereby CBDCs and traditional banking operations can be integrated. The provision of digital wallets for CBDC transactions, for example, with the provision of other value-adding banking financial services, to keep the banks\\u2019 customers engaged, will be a good partnership.Collaboration with Fintech is, among other things, likely to increase customer experience with regards to digital banking, diversify their entire range of financial products, and fasten CBDC related transactions. Additionally, integrating a Wetransfer alternative for secure and efficient data exchange could enhance banking operations and streamline financial communication.\\n\\n3. Enhancing Customer Experience\\n\\nA lot of efforts have gone into improving the experience for customers with a suite of personalized, consumer-friendly, and safe digital banking services which actually maintain market domination by bringing these customers even closer through loyalty programs, personalized financial recommendations, and smooth, easy-to-use digital interfaces. The advanced mobile banking applications will further enhance customer engagement and satisfaction through customer analytics and AI chatbots, ultimately redefining customer experience in the digital era.\\n\\nFor financial institutions, managing operations efficiently in an evolving digital ecosystem requires the right tools.

Expert Subroto Das shares insights on benefits, drawbacks, and global trends in CBDC adoption.\\n\\nSubroto Das, a financial sector expert, has decades of experience in banking and investments. He has been exposed to international finance and economics. He has also worked with an Indian financial sector regulatory body. He has studied economics at Columbia University and has a MBA from FMS, Delhi University. He has studied International Business at IIFT, Delhi.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time for this interview. Before we get started, could you briefly introduce yourself to our readers?\\n\\nThank you for having me. I\\u2019m a banker and financial sector professional with decades of experience, having worked in both the international and Indian banking sectors. I have studied economics at Columbia University, New York, and hold an MBA from FMS, Delhi University. My work in fintech, financial inclusion, and digital transformation has allowed me to observe the evolving world of digital currencies closely.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s dive right into the topic\\u2014Central Bank Digital Currencies or CBDCs. What exactly is a CBDC, and how is it different from regular money?\\n\\nIn simple terms, a CBDC is the digital form of a country\\u2019s fiat currency. It is a digital rupee that\\u2019s issued directly by the central bank\\u2014just like the paper money you have in your wallet but purely electronic. The difference is, unlike your bank account or mobile wallet, which also holds digital money, CBDCs are a direct claim on the central bank, not a commercial bank.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s driving central banks to explore and launch CBDCs?\\n\\nCentral banks see several reasons to jump on the CBDC bandwagon. For one, it\\u2019s a way to modernize the payment system, making it faster, more efficient, and inclusive. They also want to keep pace with the rise of cryptocurrencies, which operate outside their control. Let\\u2019s not forget that digital payments are already huge, but they largely depend on private intermediaries. A CBDC offers a more sovereign option\\u2014governments like being in control of money! And for countries where cash use is declining, it\\u2019s a way to maintain direct public access to central bank money in digital form.\\n\\nAre there any societal or economic benefits to CBDCs?\\n\\nDefinitely! A well-designed CBDC could improve financial inclusion, especially in countries where access to banking is limited. Imagine a scenario where anyone with a mobile phone can store and transfer digital currency, even if they don\\u2019t have a bank account. CBDCs could also reduce the costs and inefficiencies in cross-border payments, which are often slow and expensive. Another advantage is better traceability and transparency, which could help in fighting financial crimes like money laundering and tax evasion. Of course, this might feel like Big Brother watching over your shoulder, but hey, with great transparency comes great responsibility!\\n\\nWhat are the downsides of CBDCs? Surely, it\\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows?\\n\\nOh, definitely not. The main concern is privacy. If central banks can track every digital transaction, people may feel uncomfortable, especially in countries with less robust privacy laws. There\\u2019s also the risk of disintermediation\\u2014if people prefer holding CBDCs over traditional bank deposits, commercial banks could lose out on funding, which might make lending more expensive. And let\\u2019s not forget cybersecurity risks. Hackers would love to get their hands on a digital vault of central bank money! Lastly, CBDCs could become a tool for negative interest rates. Imagine your digital money shrinking just because the economy needs a nudge\\u2014sounds dystopian, doesn\\u2019t it?\\n\\nAs a fintech expert, can you explain how are CBDCs different from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?\\n\\nGreat question! The main difference is that CBDCs are centralized and backed by a government or central bank, whereas cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are decentralized and have no central authority. Think of it like this: CBDCs are the well-behaved cousin of Bitcoin\\n\\nwho refuses to follow the rules. CBDCs are stable and predictable, while most cryptocurrencies are volatile and subject to speculation.\\n\\nIndia launched its pilot for the digital rupee. Given your background as an international finance expert, how does this compare with other countries like the US, China, and the European Union?\\n\\nIndia\\u2019s digital rupee pilot is part of a larger global trend. China has been leading the race with its digital yuan, already being tested in Beijing and Shanghai. The US is more cautious\\u2014no digital dollar yet. The Cato Institute, a Washington-based think tank, has raised concerns about CBDCs, saying they could give the government too much control over citizens' financial privacy. In Europe, the European Central Bank is exploring a digital euro, but like the US, they\\u2019re proceeding carefully. Japan is in the research phase. Each country has its own approach, with some focusing on domestic payments, while others are eyeing cross-border transactions.\\n\\nAs an economist, do you think CBDCs are good for society?\\n\\nIt depends on how they\\u2019re implemented. A well-thought-out CBDC can bring significant benefits\\u2014greater financial inclusion, faster payments, and improved monetary policy tools. But without careful planning, we could end up with privacy issues and financial instability. It\\u2019s like giving a teenager the keys to a Ferrari\\u2014if they know how to drive, great; if not, disaster! So, central banks need to balance innovation with caution.\\n\\nIn conclusion, are CBDCs the future of money?\\n\\nThey\\u2019re part of the future, though I wouldn\\u2019t say they\\u2019ll completely replace cash or traditional banking anytime soon. Think of CBDCs as one tool in the toolbox of modern finance.\\n\\nThank you so much for your insights. I\\u2019m sure our readers will find this topic much clearer now!\\n\\nMy pleasure! If you ever need more explanations or just want to chat about digital money, you know where to find me.

Like to have dollars in your pocket? CBDC is that, but digital.\\n\\nSo, what\\u2019s up with normal banks then? Well, they need to keep up. CBDC makes moving money fast, easy, and often cheaper. You won\\u2019t need a bank to hold or send digital dollars. This means banks must find new ways to be useful.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s a bank\\u2019s answer to CBDC? They can\\u2019t sit back. Some are making their own tech to work with CBDC. Others might offer special services. Like giving loans or new savings plans. Banks must show they\\u2019re still a big deal in a world full of digital cash.\\n\\nAnalyzing the Disruption: How CBDC May Reshape Banking Operations\\n\\nThis CBDC wave could crash hard on traditional banking. Bank jobs will change, for sure. People in banks might work more with tech stuff. They might talk lots about \\u201cblockchain\\u201d \\u2013 that\\u2019s the tech CBDCs often ride on.\\n\\nAnd for the big banks? They could see less cash to work with. That\\u2019s because CBDCs could take over some things banks used to handle. It\\u2019s not just about a teller giving you cash. It\\u2019s about the big money moves that let banks earn their keep.\\n\\nWhen people and companies use CBDCs, they could skip the bank. This means less money banks can use to make more money. This is called \\u201cprofitability,\\u201d and it\\u2019s a big deal for banks. Less money moving through them can mean they have to get creative to stay useful.\\n\\nRisk comes with CBDCs, too. Banks are good at keeping money safe. But with CBDCs, there are new tech risks to wiggle through. Think like hackers and bugs. Banks must be strong against these, or we\\u2019re in trouble.\\n\\nThey talk about CBDCs like they\\u2019ll fix money problems for everyone. People out of the banking loop could get in easier. That means more people using bank-like services, which is great. But the banks themselves need to step up to stay at the heart of the game.\\n\\nBanks need to talk nice with CBDC systems. This is called \\u201cinteroperability.\\u201d It\\u2019s when you can move money between CBDC and regular banks without a headache.\\n\\nCBDCs and banks will both live on, for a while at least. But CBDCs mean banks need to hustle. They have to find fresh ways to help us. They must keep our money safe and keep it moving. Banks always need to bring their A-game, or they could miss out. The digital dollar rise is both a cool chance and a big challenge for banks. It\\u2019s a bit like banks got a new playground. They must figure out how to swing, climb, and slide in this techie world, or they\\u2019ll just be watching from the sidelines.\\n\\n\\n\\nStrategies for Traditional Banks Facing the CBDC Revolution\\n\\nAdapting Banking Services: Embracing CBDC-integrated Solutions\\n\\nBanks today face a big change. Digital currencies, called CBDCs, are starting to show up. They are like cash but digital. Banks need new plans to keep up. They can mix their services with CBDCs. This means they will let people use digital money just like real money. It\\u2019s huge. It will change how we pay for things and send money to others.\\n\\nBanks must think fast and smart. They should watch how CBDCs work and learn. They need to find ways to let CBDCs work with what they offer now. Banks can make apps that use both types of money. This way, people can pay the way they want.\\n\\nWorking with CBDCs can help banks. They can save money and make things faster for you. So, it\\u2019s good for banks to join in. This makes paying with digital money easy and safe. If banks do this well, they will stay strong even when things change.\\n\\nBalancing Profitability and Innovation: The Role of Banks in a CBDC-Dominant Market\\n\\nBanks make money by lending and helping with payments. But, as CBDCs come into play, they will have to change. They will need to find new ways to make money. They can no longer just count on old methods.\\n\\nCBDCs can make things better, like sending money over borders and making sure people who don\\u2019t have much money can use banks. But, banks have to be careful, too. They have to keep your money safe and follow new rules for CBDCs.\\n\\nThe key is to be both careful and bold. Banks have to be brave and try new ideas. They can make new kinds of services that use both CBDCs and the money we use now.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s also about being fair. Banks must make sure all people can use these new services. This means not leaving out people who might find it hard to use digital stuff.\\n\\nAnd of course, they need to keep your trust. They need tight security for all this digital money. Banks have a big role to fill. But if they handle it right, they can make you happy and keep making profits. They can even make the whole financial world more stable.\\n\\nIn short, CBDCs will shake things up. But it\\u2019s not the end for banks. Not at all. It\\u2019s just a new chapter. And it\\u2019s up to banks to make the best of it. They need to use CBDCs to help you more. And that\\u2019s a win for everyone.\\n\\n\\n\\nImplications of CBDC on Bank Regulations and Financial Stability\\n\\nNavigating New Regulatory Landscapes with the Advent of CBDCs\\n\\nCentral banks are jumping into digital currency. They are making their own type called CBDC. This means banks must follow new rules. For example, they need to keep money safe and follow laws about money. When a bank starts using CBDC, they have to change some stuff to follow these new rules. This takes work and smart thinking. But they can do it if they try hard and learn about CBDC.\\n\\nBanks need to make sure CBDCs are used right. They watch how people use them and check the rules. They also learn from what other banks are doing. This helps them stay safe and not break any rules.\\nSome rules might change because of CBDCs. Banks have to keep up and change the way they work. This keeps the money safe and the bank out of trouble. People are still figuring out the best way to use CBDC.\\nSome folks worry that CBDCs might shake things up too much. But if banks are careful and wise, they can handle it. They can use CBDCs to make things better for everyone.\\n\\nAssessing the Effect of CBDCs on Bank Capital and Compliance Protocols\\n\\nWhen banks start using CBDCs, they need to have enough money to back them up. This is called capital. Banks have to make sure they have enough so people trust them. They also have to follow new rules about CBDCs. This makes sure they don\\u2019t do anything wrong.\\n\\nThe rules for CBDCs can be tricky. They make sure banks have enough money and use CBDCs right. Banks have checklists to follow these rules. This helps them stay on track and not mess up.\\nCBDCs are still new. So, banks have to keep learning and getting better at using them.\\nThey talk to experts and other banks to learn the best tricks. This helps them use CBDCs in a good way. They also make sure their computers and systems are really strong.\\nThis stops hackers from stealing money. Banks have to do all this and still make money.\\n\\nCBDCs change how banks work every day. They have to plan and be ready for any kind of weather. But that\\u2019s okay. Banks are good at dealing with changes. They have smart people who know a lot about money. These people help banks use CBDCs in a good way.\\n\\nSo, CBDCs can be a bit scary at first. But they can be really good if used right. They can make sending money faster and safer. They can help people have better access to banking. That\\u2019s a big win for everyone. Banks just have to be strong and smart. They can lead the way to a cooler way to bank in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\nPreparing for the Future: Banking in the Era of Digital Currency\\n\\nThe Transition of Bank Branches and Job Roles in the Age of CBDCs\\n\\nCBDCs are the new kids on the block. Their arrival could change how we use money. Banks must get ready for this big change. They have to think about the future of their local branches. They also need to consider the jobs people do there.\\n\\nBanks will see shifts in how they work. CBDCs make many transactions faster and easier. So, some jobs in the banks will need to change or disappear. But think positive! New jobs will come. Jobs like managing digital systems and helping folks understand CBDCs. Banks can train their people for these new roles.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s talk about bank branches. They will become places for advice, not just transactions. With CBDCs, you don\\u2019t need to go there to move your money. You can do it from your phone! But if you need smart advice on saving or investing, a bank branch helps a lot.\\n\\nEnsuring Secure Transactions: Cybersecurity in the Wake of CBDC Adoption\\n\\nNow, security is a big deal. Banks have always kept our money safe. With CBDCs, they\\u2019ve got to protect our digital dollars too. Banks must step up their game in cybersecurity. They need to watch out for hackers and keep our digital wallets safe.\\n\\nThis means banks will invest more in tech gurus. These are folks who know how to fight off cyber threats. They will work hard to make sure our money\\u2019s safe online. Banks will also teach us how to spot scams and protect our own info.\\n\\nBanks are used to handling cash and cards. But with CBDCs, they\\u2019re moving into a new [TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389239045_Disruptive_Impacts_of_Central_Bank_Digital_Currencies_on_the_Traditional_Financial_System_A_Regulatory_Framework_Perspective: HTTP 403: Forbidden\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.smartsight.in/financial-services/central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdcs-its-impact-and-how-to-implement-it/\\nTitle: Untitled\\nContent:\\n\\n\""

This detailed study looks at how the issuance of a CBDC to the general public could impact the balance sheets of both central banks and commercial banks, with a particular focus on the risks and opportunities this transition might present. The authors highlight that the financial stability effects of CBDCs depend on several key factors, including the size of the issuance, the initial conditions of the financial system, and how both banks and central banks react. Through scenario analysis, the paper explores how balance sheets might change in different environments, whether under normal conditions or during crises, and the potential impacts on financial stability.\\nOne of the central concerns raised in the paper is that the issuance of CBDCs could lead to disruptions in the traditional banking system, particularly in terms of financial intermediation. The scenarios outlined in the study suggest that if CBDCs replace a significant portion of commercial bank deposits, the banking system could face challenges in maintaining stable and low-cost funding. This is particularly true when commercial banks do not have excess reserves to absorb the demand for CBDCs, forcing central banks to expand their balance sheets by providing more reserves. In such cases, banks may need to rely on more costly or volatile wholesale funding, which could lead to higher lending costs and reduce the overall availability of credit to businesses and consumers. Additionally, during periods of financial stress, there is a risk of \\\"digital bank runs,\\\" where depositors rapidly move their funds from traditional banks into CBDCs, exacerbating liquidity crises.\\nThe paper also discusses the potential consequences of CBDC adoption on banks' profitability. As banks lose cheaper deposit funding and are forced to replace it with more expensive central bank or wholesale funding, their profitability could decline. This, in turn, could lead to increased risk-taking as banks try to maintain profit margins, or it could prompt a reduction in lending to the private sector, which would have negative implications for economic growth. The authors argue that these risks are particularly pronounced when CBDC adoption is rapid or occurs during a financial crisis, as banks may struggle to adjust to the new environment in which deposits are being diverted into digital currencies.\\nIn exploring potential policy responses to these challenges, the paper suggests several options that central banks and regulators might consider. One possibility is to adjust macroprudential policies to account for the new risks introduced by CBDCs, such as tightening capital and liquidity requirements for banks. However, the authors note that macroprudential policies alone are unlikely to be sufficient to fully mitigate the risks associated with CBDC issuance. Another potential solution is to expand central bank lending to the commercial banking system, particularly during times of stress. By providing additional liquidity through mechanisms such as longer-term refinancing operations, central banks could help ensure that banks have the necessary funding to continue lending, even if they face significant deposit outflows due to CBDC adoption.\\nNevertheless, the most promising approach, according to the study, is to carefully design CBDCs in a way that limits their potential to disrupt the banking system. Specifically, the authors advocate for CBDC designs that encourage their use as a means of payment rather than as a store of value. This could be achieved through features such as imposing limits on the amount of CBDC individuals can hold or offering zero or negative interest rates on CBDC balances. These design choices would help prevent large-scale shifts of deposits from commercial banks into CBDCs, thereby reducing the risk of financial instability. Moreover, ensuring interoperability between CBDCs and traditional bank-operated payment systems could further mitigate these risks by allowing for a smoother integration of CBDCs into the existing financial system.\\nThe paper concludes by emphasizing that while CBDCs offer several potential benefits such as reducing the costs of producing and handling cash, improving financial inclusion, and enhancing the efficiency of payment systems these benefits must be weighed against the potential risks to financial stability. The authors argue that without careful consideration of these risks, CBDCs could lead to significant disruptions in the banking system, particularly if they are widely adopted in a short period of time or during times of economic stress. Therefore, central banks must carefully design CBDCs and consider a range of policy tools to ensure that their introduction does not inadvertently harm the broader financial system.\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378248849_THE_INTRODUCTION_OF_A_CENTRAL_BANK_DIGITAL_CURRENCY_CASE_STUDIES_AND_EXPERIENCES_FROM_OTHER_COUNTRIES: HTTP 403: Forbidden\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/09/Picture-this-The-ascent-of-CBDCs: Error: <StreamReset stream_id:1, error_code:2, remote_reset:True>\\n\""

Image: World Economic Forum, Central Bank Digital Currency Global Interoperability Principles\\nVarious complex types of cryptography are explained in the World Economic Forum\\u2019s Digital Currency Governance Consortium White Paper Series. These include zero-knowledge proofs, which ensures only the required level of data about an account or transaction is shared, rather than all the data.\\n\\u201cZero-knowledge proofs can be used to prove that a transaction is legitimate, while hiding the data, or for revealing information about a CBDC account balance without revealing the balance itself,\\u201d the white paper says. \\u201cFor instance, the central bank could calculate an interest payment or benefits for a stimulus payment for a certain account, without seeing the size of the account balance.\\u201d\\nExamples of CBDC privacy protections in practice\\nSweden\\u2019s central bank, the Riksbank, has put in place privacy architecture for its pilot of the e-krona CBDC. This involves the use of an open-source distributed ledger that ensures information is only shared to central bank authorities, financial regulatory authorities and financial intermediaries on a need-to-know basis.\\n\\u201cThis allows for a level of privacy that is akin to the two-tiered model used by central banks today,\\u201d the World Economic Forum Digital Currency Governance Consortium White Paper Series says.\\n\\nSweden\\u2019s privacy architecture for its CBDC.

        "value": "The introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is likely to have profound implications for the traditional banking system and financial stability in the coming five years. This analysis synthesizes prior insights with updated perspectives gleaned from recent resources.\n\n### 1. **Transformation of the Banking Landscape**\nCBDCs represent direct liabilities of central banks, making them a sovereign and secure digital alternative to commercial bank deposits. While it's accurate to highlight their safety, it's essential to qualify this. Users may still face risks related to platform vulnerabilities, systemic cyber threats, and potential government oversight. The expectation that individuals will prefer holding CBDCs could reduce deposits in commercial banks, thereby impacting their ability to lend. In countries where CBDC pilots are in progress, data show varying consumer behaviors that suggest a significant, though not absolute, shift may occur. For example, the experience in China with the digital yuan indicates an increased willingness among consumers to experiment with state-backed digital currencies.\n\n### 2. **Financial Stability Concerns**\nWidespread CBDC adoption raises substantial risks to financial stability. The concern over \"digital bank runs\" during times of financial stress is valid; if individuals can quickly convert traditional bank deposits into CBDCs, this could exacerbate liquidity crises. A report from the International Monetary Fund notes that a significant shift of deposits could pressure commercial banks to seek alternative funding sources\u2014often at a higher cost\u2014leading to reduced lending and increased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses (IMF Working Paper). Past financial crises, where rapid asset movement created instability, exemplify these risks.\n\n### 3. **Monetary Policy Implications**\nCBDCs could significantly alter monetary policy implementation. Concerns about their popularity causing central banks to struggle with inflation and interest rate controls are justified. Marked adoption metrics, such as transaction volumes and adoption rates, will be crucial in evaluating how CBDCs might be utilized as tools for monetary policy. Central banks may need to innovate policy frameworks to address the dynamic relationship between CBDCs and traditional cash assets, with potential adjustments to interest rates for CBDC holdings suggested to manage demand effectively.\n\n### 4. **Enhanced Financial Inclusion**\nOn the positive side, CBDCs potentially foster greater financial inclusion, particularly in regions underserved by traditional banking infrastructures. Evidence from current CBDC trials, like those in Nigeria and India, shows that mobile access to government-backed digital wallets facilitates economic participation. This inclusion could not only empower individuals but also contribute to a more resilient overall economy by broadening the economic base.\n\n### 5. **Cybersecurity and Privacy Challenges**\nAs CBDCs become integrated into the financial landscape, they will require robust cybersecurity frameworks to deter cyber threats. Central banks are aware of these risks and must implement new technologies and protocols to enhance security. The related privacy concerns pose a challenge, as extensive transaction tracking could lead to public apprehension regarding government surveillance. Innovative cryptographic measures, like zero-knowledge proofs, are being explored to maintain user confidentiality while allowing regulators to prevent illegal activities (World Economic Forum).\n\n### 6. **Industry Adaptation and Innovation**\nTo remain competitive, banks will need to embrace digital transformation strategies that integrate CBDCs. This involves enhancing existing infrastructure, developing hybrid financial models, and offering value-added services that combine CBDC transactions with traditional banking offerings. Banks may increasingly collaborate with fintech companies to innovate their product offerings and improve customer experiences, ensuring they are not sidelined in an increasingly digital cash environment (Payline Data and others).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe introduction of CBDCs threatens to reshape traditional banking operations and poses significant implications for financial stability. Banks must prepare for this shift by adapting their business models, innovating services, and ensuring robust cybersecurity. Policymakers will also play a critical role in designing and regulating CBDCs to minimize potential disruptions while maximizing their benefits, such as improved financial inclusion and effective monetary policy. Continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies will be essential as the landscape evolves over the coming years."

It could benefit from examples of potential threats and corresponding strategies to mitigate them.\"\n\n  - statement: \"The related privacy concerns pose a challenge, as extensive transaction tracking could lead to public apprehension regarding government surveillance.\"\n    reason: \"While the concern is valid, it would add depth to discuss specific examples of how transaction tracking has previously affected public trust and to quantify public apprehension concerning government surveillance linked to CBDCs.\"\n\n  - statement: \"To remain competitive, banks will need to embrace digital transformation strategies that integrate CBDCs.\"\n    reason: \"This statement is somewhat vague and could benefit from specific examples of what these digital transformation strategies might entail. Providing case studies of banks innovating successfully with CBDCs would offer clearer prospects.\"\n\n  - statement: \"Policymakers will also play a critical role in designing and regulating CBDCs to minimize potential disruptions while maximizing their benefits.\"\n    reason: \"The statement makes a valid point, yet it does not elaborate on what 'minimizing disruptions' might involve or provide guidelines on effective policymaking for CBDCs. Including current regulatory challenges and proposed solutions would strengthen this discussion.\"\n\n```"

Our results are relevant for commercial banks, contributing to better assessments of the impact of CBDCs on liquidity and profitability and help central banks to identify implementation costs for banks within historical and hypothetical interest rate environments.

The Covid-19 pandemic led to heightened cryptocurrency volatility as it became a perceived safe-haven asset amidst economic uncertainty, while the Russia-Ukraine military conflict showcased the impact of geopolitical events on cryptocurrency markets and the relevance of understanding market risks in portfolio management and investment strategies (Jobst et al., 2023).\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Digital Currency and Economic Crises: Helping States Respond\\nURL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03023\\nCONTENT: The current crisis, at the time of writing, has had a profound impact on the financial world, introducing the need for creative approaches to revitalising the economy at the micro level as well as the macro level.

Besides the functional monetary policy improvements purported by macro policy and financial stability research, most of the expected benefits of introducing CBDCs need more evidence to make a winning case for central bank digital currencies. Alternative literature partly focuses on the practical results from regulatory preparations and adoption challenges, while some scholars study relevant historical arguments for CBDCs. The socioeconomic impact of the digitalization of money, currency competition between private and public money, and direct access to central bank liabilities are vital themes that researchers focus on to bridge past research with the recent rise of digital currencies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: PDF\\nURL: https://www.snb.ch/dam/jcr:39ebbcc1-62d5-4c39-8574-404e191204d1/sem_2023_05_26_lamersdorf.n.pdf\\nCONTENT: After the market for reserves closes, banks face a re\\ufb01nancing shock: they learn that a (stochastic) fraction of entrepreneurs they fund needs to purchase more inputs, either with deposits or with CBDC.

The potential of blockchain technology to democratise financial services, enhance payment system efficiency, and streamline cross-border transfers by reducing costs and burdens has prompted central banks to consider central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a viable solution (Agur et al., 2022; Auer and B\\u04e7hme, 2020; Central Bank of Nigeria [CBN], 2021; Ozili, 2023b). These findings corroborate numerous studies (e.g., Ryu, 2018; Xu et al., 2017; Kleijnen et al., 2007) that have demonstrated the role of seamless transactions, perceived superiority, and time convenience in shaping user attitudes and intentions, particularly regarding the adoption of emerging technologies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nQuery: cybersecurity measures for CBDCs the central bank perspective\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: Central Bankers' New Cybersecurity Challenge - IMF\\nURL: https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/09/Central-bankers-new-cybersecurity-challenge-Fanti-Lipsky-Moehr\\nCONTENT: About the IMF Until recently, little work had been done publicly in the cybersecurity and central banking world to actually understand the specific cybersecurity and privacy risks associated with CBDCs. Few have considered whether CBDC designs could mitigate risks or perhaps even improve the cybersecurity of a financial system. Our new research, published in the Atlantic Council\\u2019s recent report, titled \\u201cMissing Key\\u2013The Challenge of Cybersecurity and CBDCs,\\u201d analyzes the novel cybersecurity risks CBDCs may present for financial systems and makes the case that policymakers have ample options to safely introduce CBDCs. There are many design variants for CBDCs, ranging from centralized databases to distributed ledgers to token-based systems. Many of the proposed design variants for CBDCs (particularly retail CBDCs) involve the centralized collection of transaction data, posing major privacy and security risks.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: Missing Key: The challenge of cybersecurity and central bank digital ...\\nURL: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/missing-key/\\nCONTENT: Crafting international CBDC cybersecurity and privacy regulations with democratic values is in the United States\\u2019 national security interest.

These protections are built upon select security and operational frameworks that guide system operators through risk assessments and the subsequent implementation of security controls based on the sensitivity of the data stored on the information system. The shared ownership and distributed character of a DLT-based CBDC mean that system responsibilities would not fall to one particular operator, and therefore, the implementation of security practices derived from frameworks like those highlighted in this note may benefit from institutional and end-user coordination, as well as the use of shared standards.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Cybersecurity and risk considerations for CBDCs\\nURL: https://digitalpoundfoundation.com/cybersecurity-and-risk-considerations-for-cbdcs/\\nCONTENT: Governments and central banks around the world are exploring the benefits that a central bank digital currency can bring to their economies.

As central banks globally explore the possibilities of CBDCs, their progress, challenges, and potential impact on traditional banking are subjects of significant interest and debate. The potential benefits of CBDCs include increased efficiency in payment systems, enhanced financial inclusion, and the ability for central banks to have more direct control over monetary policy. If consumers opt to hold CBDCs directly with the central bank, it could reduce the amount of funds held in commercial banks, impacting their ability to lend and potentially altering the dynamics of the traditional banking system.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: CBDC explained: How It Works, Types, and Examples\\nURL: https://www.supermoney.com/encyclopedia/cbdc\\nCONTENT: These digital forms of fiat currency, issued by central banks, offer a new method of facilitating transactions, improving financial inclusion, and potentially transforming global financial systems. Central banks are exploring CBDCs as a way to streamline their monetary systems, reduce transaction costs, and promote financial inclusion. In countries like Nigeria, where CBDCs have already been implemented, the goal is to provide individuals who lack access to traditional banking with a secure and stable way to conduct digital transactions. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are poised to revolutionize the global financial system by offering a secure, efficient, and inclusive form of digital currency. Unlike fiat currency, CBDCs are designed to function entirely in digital form, offering enhanced security, faster transaction times, and lower costs, especially for cross-border payments.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Central Bank Independence: CBDCs and Monetary Policy Autonomy\\nURL: https://fastercapital.com/content/Central-Bank-Independence--CBDCs-and-Monetary-Policy-Autonomy.html\\nCONTENT: 4.

CBDCs: an opportunity for the monetary system\\nURL: https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2021e3.htm\\nCONTENT: Although CBDCs and FPS have many characteristics in common, one difference is that CBDCs extend the unique features and benefits of today's digital central bank money directly to the general public.17 In a CBDC, a payment only involves transferring a direct claim on the central bank from one end user to another. In addition to these operational considerations, the broader impact on financial intermediation activity is an important consideration in assessing the economic impact of CBDCs. Just like cash, CBDCs can be designed to maximise usefulness in payments, without giving rise to large inflows onto the central bank's balance sheet.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nQuery: regulatory frameworks for CBDC across different countries\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: The Global Landscape of CBDCs: Different Approaches and Models\\nURL: https://totalbitcoin.org/global-landscape-cbdc/\\nCONTENT: The landscape of CBDCs encompasses variations between retail and wholesale models, alongside a complex interplay of regulatory frameworks and privacy-centric designs.

In the realm of traditional banking, CBDCs hold the potential to streamline payment systems, lower transaction costs, and enhance financial inclusion. The introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is expected to bring about significant changes in the financial intermediation landscape, impacting the flow of funds between savers and borrowers and potentially reshaping the traditional roles of financial institutions. The introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is set to disrupt existing payment systems, leading to significant changes in the financial transaction landscape. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have the potential to significantly impact the role of central banks in financial regulation.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Examining the impact of a central bank digital currency on the access ...\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521924001522\\nCONTENT: This study examines the potential social change associated with technological innovations such as a central bank digital currency (CBDC), via the CBDC's ability to reduce the level of a nation's unbanked and underbanked households. The study's findings make several new contributions to this nascent area investigating the impact of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on financial inclusion and social change. In a related study exploring the factors leading to the adoption of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the Netherlands, Bijlsma et al. These studies indicate that the adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) can decrease the number of unbanked individuals and enhance financial inclusion.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: PDF\\nURL: https://www.federalreserve.gov/files/macro-implications-of-cbdc-executive-summary-202211.pdf\\nCONTENT: There are also two appendices, one compares a CBDC to the Federal Reserve\\u2019s overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, while the other discusses the international experience with CBDCs. Regarding the banking sector, the paper notes four factors of importance: the remuneration of the CBDC; the competitive structure of the banking sector; access to alternative sources of funding to retail deposits; and the central bank\\u2019s policy in response to shifts in holdings between CBDC and reserves and currency on its balance sheet. But those same features facilitate run risk because they make a CBDC a near-perfect substitute for bank deposits: the introduction of widely accessible, fully safe asset, offered at a fixed administered rate, could incentivize agents to run from the financial sector in times of market stress.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: CBDC and banking stability: Modeling cascading effects on reserves ...\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090944324000693\\nCONTENT: It is based on this observation that this article aims to analyse the potential impact of the introduction of CBDCs on the banking system, with a focus on the effects of excess confidence in CBDCs, the effects of covering each CBDC issuance with mandatory reserves in fiat currency, the effects of higher interest rates in the context of CBDC issuance, and the effects of rapid growth in the creation of scriptural money in the context of CBDCs.

Impact of Digital Currencies on Traditional Banking Digital currencies tend to alter the traditional banking model because they have alternative possibilities, which can gradually reduce the demand for intermediate players like banks and thus make for more efficient, low-cost transactions in a changing traditional financial business process. Digital currencies have revolutionized the traditional banking system and financial activities.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nQuery: analysis of CBDC security vulnerabilities and risks\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC): Comprehensive Analysis ... - Medium\\nURL: https://medium.com/@altinvestbot/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc-comprehensive-analysis-of-global-development-benefits-and-21c7fe0c4e8e\\nCONTENT: Technical and Cybersecurity Challenges: CBDC systems, which are accessible to the public, may expose more security vulnerabilities, leading to technical and cyberattack risks.

Drawing on an international database on CBDC adoption, data on 1176 banks operating in 86 countries from 2010 to 2021 were used to construct a time-varying CBDC adoption index. Our key results suggest that the adoption of CBDC contributes to financial stability. Furthermore, bank size, capitalization, operational strategy, deposit funding and domestic investment also contribute positively while loan loss reserve negatively affects bank stability. These findings are robust to a comprehensive set of tests. We further find that CBDC helps to reduce leverage and asset risks. Other evidence suggests that the adoption of CBDC can be associated with expanded lending, increased asset quality and reduced loan loss reserves. However, the impact of CBDC is only pronounced for banks of reasonable size but not for smaller banks. Moreover, CBDC adoption appears to have a more positive impact in emerging economies than in advanced economies. Finally, retail CBDC is found to promote stability, whereas wholesale CBDC hampers it. Overall, our findings have profound implications for the adoption of CBDCs and their implications for financial stability.\\n\\nPrevious article in issue\\nNext article in issue\\n\\nKeywords\\nCBDC\\nFinancial stability\\nBanking sector\\nRetails CBDC\\nWholesale CBDC\\nCentral banking\\nCBDC adoption index\\nRecommended articles\\nData availability\\nData will be made available on request.\\nCited by (0)\\n\\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

CBDCs are a type of central bank digital currency that can be used for a wide range of purposes, including digital payment. Central banks have the potential to provide a cost-effective and inclusive digital payment solution also for the unbanked population and support economic growth. However, the impacts of CBDCs are still uncertain, both in terms of the magnitude and probability of effects. Central banks should have a multifaceted strategy that includes understanding, identifying, managing, and mitigating risks associated with CBDC design to manage unintended macroeconomic consequences. This involves assessing demand for CBDCs, evaluating deposit structures and vulnerabilities to disintermediation, examining the effectiveness of proposed measures like caps, and considering changes in money velocity and monetary policies regimes. Strengthening liquidity management is crucial to mitigate liquidity risks arising from CBDCs funded by bank deposits. Therefore, this paper focuses on the impact of CBDCs on monetary policy, including deposit disintermediation and increased volatility of commercial bank reserves.\\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.\\nAccess this article\\nLog in via an institution\\nSubscribe and save\\nSpringer+ Basic\\n$34.99 /Month\\n\\nGet 10 units per month\\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\\nCancel anytime\\n\\nSubscribe now\\nBuy Now\\nBuy article PDF USD 39.95\\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\\nRent this article via DeepDyve\\nInstitutional subscriptions\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\n\\nTowards Optimal Technological Solutions for Central Bank Digital Currencies\\nChapter \\u00a9 2022\\n\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies in the Global Economy: Lessons from China's Digital Yuan for the Development of the European Central Bank's Digital Euro\\nChapter \\u00a9 2024\\n\\nCentral bank digital currency, loan supply, and bank failure risk: a microeconomic approach\\nArticle Open access 06 December 2021\\nReferences\\n\\n\\nAhnert, T., Assenmacher, K., Hoffmann, P., Leonello, A., Monnet, C., & Porcellacchia, D.

Mechanisms that limit the transfer of risk, such as an unattractive interest rate, a quantity ceiling or the non-convertibility of cash and reserves into CBDC, are likely to discourage the use of CBDC as a medium of exchange and thus defeat the purpose of issuing CBDC.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nCentral banks and international institutions have been discussing the pros and cons of central bank digital currency (CBDC) over the past few years.Footnote 1 In the debate, the main distinction is between wholesale CBDC, which is available only to financial intermediaries, and retail CBDC, which is available to the public. Wholesale CBDC already exists in the form of sight deposits held by commercial banks at the central bank; issuing it in a different form or through a different technological medium would probably have little economic impact. In contrast, the issuance of retail CBDC would have significant economic implications. In this paper, we discuss the issuance of retail CBDC, which we refer to as CBDC for simplicity.\\n\\nThe idea of a central bank issuing a digital currency available to the public is not new; it goes back to Tobin (1987), who argued that \\u201cI think the government should make available to the public a medium with the convenience of deposits and the safety of currency, essentially currency on deposit, transferable in any amount by check or other order.\\u201d A number of arguments for issuing CBDC have been put forward in recent years, for example by Ahnert et al. (2022), Barrdear and Kumhof (2016), Bindseil (2020), BIS (2020), Bordo and Levin (2017), ECB (2023), Goodfriend (2016). The main purposes of issuing CBDCs are (1) to provide central bank money to the public as the use of cash declines, (2) to improve the resilience of electronic payments by providing a back-up system, (3) to promote diversity and sovereignty in payment systems, and (4) to enhance monetary policy.Footnote 2\\n\\nThere are significant challenges to achieving these purposes with a CBDC. The issuance of a CBDC in the current banking system can lead to a significant transfer of credit risk from commercial banks to the central bank. When depositors transfer their risky deposits to CBDC, the central bank responds to the demand to keep money-market rates and its monetary policy stance unchanged by taking on the banks\\u2019 credit risk on its balance sheet. To limit this transfer of credit risk, it is highly desirable for the central bank to limit and control the amount of CBDC. However, limiting the demand for or supply of CBDC is likely to discourage the use of CBDC as a medium of exchange and encourage the holding of CBDC as a store of value. If held as a store of value, CBDC may not achieve some of its intended purposes, such as the establishment of a sovereign electronic payment system. As long as the bulk of money in our monetary system is issued in the form of risky bank deposits, some purposes that CBDC is intended to serve would be better served by solutions based on bank deposits rather than central bank money.\\n\\n2 Implications of CBDC for the conduct of monetary policy\\n\\nWhat would happen if the central bank makes CBDC available to the public? The effects of CBDC on the conduct of monetary policy depends largely on the issuance model and any changes to the monetary system. In central banks and international institutions, the debate on the issuance of CBDC takes place in the context of the current fractional-reserve banking system. Central banks that discuss the possibility of issuing CBDC never do so with the aim of abolishing the fractional-reserve banking system, but rather with the aim of issuing CBDC within this system.Footnote 3 We therefore assume that the monetary and banking system remains unchanged, apart from the issuance of CBDC itself.Footnote 4 In order to fulfil its mandate of price stability, the central bank continues to influence the expansion of money and credit of commercial banks by steering money-market interest rates through the issuance of reserves and by setting the interest rate paid on these reserves.\\n\\n2.1 CBDC in the fractional-reserve banking system\\n\\nIn their primary role, banks perform three interrelated functions. First, banks are intermediaries for non-bank money holdings. Non-banks deposit their money with their bank, which holds reserves at the central bank. This is the two-tier dimension of the system. Second, banks lend to non-banks and play an important role in the credit market. And third, banks issue deposits in order to grant credit and play an key role in the process of money creation. This is the fractional-reserve dimension of the system. Contrary to popular belief, banks do not collect deposits in order to lend (as pension funds do, for example), but create the deposits they lend. Banks are therefore not credit intermediaries (because they create new deposits when they lend), but monetary intermediaries (because non-banks hold their money through banks).\\n\\nThe lending process by commercial banks is key to the monetary policy transmission mechanism, as it is when commercial banks lend that money first enters circulation in the form of customer deposits. This would remain the case if the central bank made CBDC available to the public. What would change, however, is that the public would be able to request the redemption of their bank deposits not only in cash but also in CBDC. That is not an insignificant detail, because the demand for CBDC could be considerably higher than the demand for cash. The redemption of deposits in cash is generally limited because cash is vulnerable to loss and theft and is less convenient than deposits for settling payments. However, the redemption of deposits into CBDC is likely to be on a much larger scale, as CBDC enjoys all the benefits of deposits without bearing credit risk. Thus, in normal times, the demand for CBDC is likely to be significantly higher than the demand for cash, especially when the opportunity cost of money holding, i.e. interest rates, is low. Moreover, the demand for CBDC is likely to increase further in times of crisis, as underlined by Agur et al. (2019), Bech and Garratt (2017), Jordan (2018) or Stevens (2017). Since it is much easier to transfer money from a bank deposit to a CBDC account (one click) than to withdraw cash at the counter, depositors will be much more likely to quickly convert their deposits into CBDC during periods of financial instability.\\n\\nWhat are the implications for the banking system? The literature is often inaccurate in describing the impact of CBDC on the economy. As CBDC would substitute for bank deposits, banks would have fewer deposits on their balance sheets and it is often said that banks would consequently lend less. Fewer deposits, fewer loans, the argument goes. This view is misguided because in the fractional-reserve banking system banks do not need deposits to lend because they create the deposits they lend.\\n\\nHowever, while banks do not need deposits to lend, they do need liquidity to fund the payment that usually follows the lending. As the CBDC would substitute for some of the bank deposits, banks would also have less liquidity on their balance sheets and this could hamper their lending as far as the money market is concerned. The money-market interest rate is the price that banks pay for borrowing liquidity. Therefore, the effect of CBDC on bank lending depends on the effect of CBDC on money-market rates.\\n\\nIf there were no central bank, the outflow of liquidity from banks would dry up the money market and push up interest rates, making it more difficult for banks to lend. However, since the central bank conducts monetary policy by keeping money-market rates close to its policy rate, it would automatically conduct the necessary operations to neutralise the possible effects of CBDC on the money market. If the central bank did not offset these effects, the demand for CBDC would lead to an autonomous change in its monetary policy stance, which would be contrary to its objective of price stability. For example, if the central bank did not meet the rising demand for central bank money, the scarcity would lead to an undesirable rise in money-market rates, which would slow down the process of bank credit expansion and cause inflation to fall below target. In the worst case, the scarcity of central bank money could lead to the failure of some banks, which is equivalent to a contraction of broad money and could lead to a debt-deflation spiral.Footnote 5 It is therefore realistic to assume that the central bank would keep money-market interest rates close to its policy rate, irrespective of the demand for CBDC.\\n\\nSince money-market conditions would not be affected by CBDC\\u00a0due to the central bank's accommodation, banks\\u2019 ability to lend and issue new deposits would also be unaffected, even if some of their previously issued deposits were substituted for CBDC. Andolfatto (2020) and Brunnermeier and Niepelt (2019) reach a similar conclusion, pointing out that a central bank committed to following an interest rate policy rule and acting as lender of last resort provides banks with the funds to substitute deposits.\\n\\nWould CBDC lead to disintermediation of banks? To the extent that non-banks hold CBDC directly rather than bank deposits, the role of banks as monetary intermediaries would be reduced. However, to the extent that banks are not credit intermediaries, their ability to lend would not be affected as long as the central bank keeps money-market conditions unchanged. In order to fulfil its price stability mandate, the central bank would thus be induced to meet the demand for C[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5147760\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nCentral Bank Digital Currency Launch and Financial Stability of Banks: Dynamic Panel Estimation\\n\\n8 Pages\\nPosted: 21 Feb 2025\\n\\nDennis Heitmann\\n\\nUniversity of Applied Sciences Kaiserslautern\\n\\nJascha-Alexander Koch\\n\\nUniversity Siegen - School of Economic Disciplines; University of Siegen\\n\\nMohammad Saiful Islam\\n\\nUniversity of Siegen\\n\\nSharmin Akter Eva\\n\\naffiliation not provided to SSRN\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nAround ninety percent of the central banks worldwide are currently running initiatives to explore central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Surprisingly, only four countries \\u2013 including the Bahamas, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and Jamaica \\u2013 have so far launched CBDCs. In this regard, it is of special importance to understand how launching a CBDC impacts the financial system. Therefore, we investigate the impact of launching a CBDC on banks\\u2019 financial stability. We use panel data of 57 commercial banks of these four countries using CBDCs for the period of 2010 to 2023. Applying two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) as dynamic panel estimation, we uncover the interesting result that launching a CBDC results in higher financial stability of banks.

They aim to explore potential benefits, risks, and the broad range of new capabilities CBDCs might offer. Some view CBDC exploration as an opportunity to rethink their existing, legacy payment systems and build a resilient and secure infrastructure using modern technologies. However, a CBDC creates a vast and complex ecosystem that amplifies existing risk exposures and surfaces new ones. Given the implications of issuing a CBDC, it should be seen as a fundamental change in the way the central bank operates.\\n\\nIt can be said that without security, there is no trust, and without trust, there is no money.3 A CBDC ecosystem will be a high-value target for a range of threat actors including nation-states and cyber criminals, and any successful attack or operational failure resulting in a service outage, data breach, or fraud will erode public trust and confidence with systemic implications. A well-functioning CBDC system therefore requires a resilient and efficient infrastructure, with the ability to onboard, authenticate, and support users on a large scale. It will necessitate an architecture that is flexible and scalable, expandable for future functionalities, and one that has security at its core.\\n\\nCBDC implementation involves a range of new, technical and operational considerations which do not apply to existing payment systems. These include the use of digital tools for life-cycle management of the currency, and the use of programmability and smart contracts for its utility and efficient transfer. To maintain service continuity, seamless switching between online and offline modality may also be necessary. In addition, it requires foundational factors to be in place at a national level, such as stable and efficient communication networks, digital and financial literacy and cyber risk awareness of payment system users, technological maturity of institutions, collaboration between stakeholders, and a stable geopolitical environment.\\n\\nCBDC design choices have policy and security implications, and this note covers the latter. CBDCs can be retail or wholesale, token or account-based. The underpinning architecture can be direct or intermediated; centralized or distributed; can use programmability and smart contracts; and be available offline or online. They could also use new technologies such as distributed ledgers (DLT) and artificial intelligence (AI) and be hosted in-house or in a cloud environment. These choices have different implications for operational and cyber resilience of a CBDC and the ecosystem within which it operates.\\n\\nThe design choices considered in this note relate to a retail CBDC given its higher complexity. A retail CBDC ecosystem is vast, complex, and highly interconnected. It includes participants who are outside the central bank\\u2019s purview and governed by a different rule book. It\\u2019s efficient operations are also highly reliant on telecom networks and national infrastructures. On the other hand, a wholesale CBDC ecosystem is only available to financial institutions and therefore comprises fewer participants who are largely within the supervision of financial sector authorities and can operate within closed loop managed networks. Cyber and operational risks related to wholesale CBDC ecosystems could almost be seen as a subset of those confronted by its retail counterpart. Essentially, the key risks in a wholesale CBDC come down to \\u201cinsider\\u201d threats.4\\n\\nAlthough there are examples of some live CBDCs, their adoption has been very low. Many countries are at various stages of exploration and experimentation which is largely focused on policy goals and functionality with little or no testing for cyber resilience. This limits practical intelligence required for the development of specific security guidance. However, lessons can be derived from existing information security frameworks for critical financial systems and services. Some work in this regard has already been completed by the BIS Innovation Hub. Insights from this work and from the results of CBDC experiments underway, will be leveraged in future updates to this note.5,6\\n\\nThis note considers experiences from live CBDCs and is informed by experiments conducted by central banks and international institutions for domestic use. It also draws from cybersecurity and resilience frameworks from standard-setting bodies. It is organized into four sections. Sections I and II introduce digital risks including cyber risks and their impact on an interconnected CBDC ecosystem. Section III describes the attributes and examines pros and cons of commonly considered design options in a domestic, retail CBDC implementation, and suggests potential mitigations. Section IV delves into best practices for developing a cyber-resilient CBDC ecosystem.\\n\\nSection I. Cyber Risk: Context and Overview\\n\\nAs a payment instrument in digital form, CBDCs are exposed to digital risks as well as payment systems risks. Digital risks encompass a broad range of threats and vulnerabilities associated with the use of digital technologies and digital transformation initiatives. They sit at the intersection of people, process, technology, and data, both internal to the institution and within its supply chain (Annex 1).\\n\\nCybersecurity is generally managed along three core principles, also called the \\u201cCIA Triad\\u201d or Information Security Trust principles. These are:\\n\\nConfidentiality, that data is only visible and accessible to authorized users and for specific purpose(s).\\n\\nIntegrity, that data is accurate and complete. Integrity needs to be ensured for data at rest and in motion and of code or logic used for its processing.\\n\\nAvailability, that the system and data are accessible and usable as needed, and functioning as expected. Availability controls should extend to all underlying components and interconnections that could cause outages or delays to an expected service.\\n\\nVulnerabilities in people, process, and technology can be exploited by cyber threat actors to launch cyberattacks, resulting in service outages, data breaches, and fraud. It should be noted that people vulnerabilities due to errors, malintent, or manipulation can significantly impact the effectiveness of processes and technology. Reportedly, over 80 percent of cyberattacks are due to the human element.7 In addition, 99 percent of cyberattacks can be avoided by practicing foundational security hygiene and organization-wide training and awareness.8, 9 There are several types of cyberattacks relevant to the financial sector (Table 1).\\n\\nTypes of Cyberattacks\\n\\nTypes of Cyberattacks\\n\\nType of Attack | Impact\\nDenial of service (DoS)/Distributed denial of service (DDoS) | Denial of access to legitimate users by artificially overwhelming the network bandwidth. A variant of this is DDoS which is executed from various and widely dispersed sources.

The issuance of central bank money takes also the form of deposit (Biondi, 2018, p. 4). Access to the second form of central bank money is generally granted only to designated banks and other authorized entities. These two forms represent central bank liabilities.[1]\\n\\nThe development of private virtual currencies and digital tokens, including those based on blockchain technology, as well as the declining use of cash as a means of payment, have generated a debate on the potential issuance of a new form of money\\u00a0\\u2013 central bank digital currency (CBDC). The questions in this regard focus mainly on the accessibility of central bank digital currency (wide or restricted) and the technology used (token- or account-based). They also include the potential implications of CBDC issuance for financial, monetary and payment system. Potential drivers of CBDC development in individual countries may relate to technological factors, i.e.\\u00a0digital infrastructure, innovation capacity and institutional quality, as well as perceived demand for a CBDC arising from financial inclusion, public interest in CBDC and cross-border transactions (Auer et\\u00a0al., 2020, pp. 11\\u201312).\\n\\nBoar and Wehrli (2021) present the results of a survey carried out among central banks in late 2020 regarding their engagement with CBDC. They show that the vast majority of central banks have already developed the concept of digital money.[2] Their motivations and intentions regarding CBDC issuance are different. Matters of concern include financial stability, monetary policy implementation and financial inclusion, as well as the efficiency and safety of payments, and they are shaped by local circumstances (Boar & Wehrli, 2021, p. 14). Central banks have made great efforts to identify the challenges of launching a CBDC and to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of the idea (Barontini & Holden, 2019, p. 12), including cross-border and global dimensions[3] (Boar et\\u00a0al., 2020, p. 9). In this respect, it is important to research the essence of contemporary money, especially that issued by central banks, and analyse the implications for different stakeholders arising from different technological, organizational and regulatory assumptions relating to the issue of central bank digital money.\\n\\nThe aim of the paper is to review and discuss the implications of a new form of central bank money\\u00a0\\u2013 central bank digital currency (CBDC)\\u00a0\\u2013 for central and commercial banks, identified in the literature and by central banks. The author\\u2019s intention is also to indicate possible differences in the approach to this issue by researchers and individual central banks. The study is based on a review covering both academic literature and central banks official documents on retail CBDC. It also includes a comparative analysis of CBDC concepts (disregarding the level of implementation) outlined by 13 European and non-European central banks in their official reports.\\n\\nThe rest of the article is organised as follows. Section 2 presents general concept and characteristics of CBDC. Section 3 provides a literature review on the implications of CBDCs for the banking system. Section 4 considers the implications of CBDC issuance for banking systems identified by central banks. Section 5 concludes.\\n\\n2 General Concept and Characteristics of CBDC\\n\\nContemporary monetary systems are generally based on central bank money and commercial bank money.[4] Central bank money takes the form of widely accessible cash, and account-based reserves with access limited to banks and some other institutions. Central banks support commercial bank money by allowing commercial banks to settle interbank payments using central bank money, enabling convertibility between commercial and central bank money through banknote provision, and offering contingent liquidity through the lender of last resort function (BIS, 2020, p. 4). The coexistence of central and commercial bank money (deposit money) in most countries and currency areas serves the public and financial system properly. This is especially due to efficient private retail payment systems and payment services infrastructure based mainly on public-private partnership (BIS, 2018, p. 1). The features of current forms of money and the relations between them have been described in detail by, inter alia: Ryan-Collins et\\u00a0al. (2011), Jackson and Dyson (2012), McLeay et\\u00a0al. (2014) and Huber (2017). The idea of central bank digital currency is related to upgrading the traditional central bank monopoly on paper money and bringing it into the digital age (Bjerg, 2017, p. 54).\\n\\nCentral bank digital currency is not clearly defined term and is used to refer to a number of concepts. In this paper, it is referred to as a new form of central bank money, representing a central bank liability, denominated in an existing unit of account, which serves both as a medium of exchange and a store of value (BIS, 2018). CBDC is a form of central bank money that takes the form of an electronic record widely available to the general public, and therefore differs from the money available to banks and other selected entities (financial institutions involved in the implementation of monetary policy) on accounts held with the central bank, on which minimum reserves are held or under which payment orders are settled. CBDC is also distinguished from stablecoin defined as a cryptocurrency aimed at maintaining its value stable with respect to official currencies (Fantacci & Gobbi, 2021). In fact, CBDC is official currency and a legal tender.\\n\\nThis study concentrates on general purpose retail CBDC.[5] There are two possible designs discussed in the literature: an account-based CBDC and a token-based (or valued-based) CBDC.[6] The distinction between token- and account-based money relates to the form of verification needed when it is used as a means of payment (Kahn & Roberds, 2009). In the case of token-based money, verification relies on the ability of the payee to verify the validity of the payment object, as in the counterfeiting of cash. Payments with account-based money depend fundamentally on the ability to verify the identity of the account holder. The simplest theoretical ways of launching a CBDC would be either to allow the public to hold deposit accounts with the central bank (C\\u0153ur\\u00e9, 2018, p. 13), or to issue electronic tokens by the central bank.\\n\\nFurther assumptions of the rules of CBDC issuance concern availability, anonymity, transfer mechanism, interest bearing and limits. They all matter for the consequences of the introduction of CBDC for the functioning of the banking system[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/a-pros-and-cons-analysis-of-the-cbdc\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nAchievers Corner\\n\\nPrelims\\n\\nMains & Interview\\n\\nCurrent Affairs\\n\\nDrishti Specials\\n\\nStudy Material\\n\\nState PCS\\n\\nTest Series\\n\\nVideos\\n\\n\\n\\nDaily Updates\\n\\nIndian Economy\\n\\nA Pros and Cons Analysis of the CBDC\\n\\nThis editorial is based on \\u201cCBDC in India \\u2014 the Pros and the Cons\\u201d which was published in The Hindu BusinessLine on 23/04/2022.

In December 2022, India started its CBDC pilot program to continue its transition towards a digitized payments economy. This paper presents the first empirical analysis utilizing detailed transaction data to explore the dynamics between CBDCs and existing digital payment methods, as well as the implications of increased CBDC usage on traditional bank deposits. Our findings reveal that policies which increase transaction costs for current digital payment methods catalyze a substitution effect, bolstering CBDC adoption. Furthermore, an uptick in CBDC usage is associated with a notable decline in bank, cash, and savings deposits, suggesting potential paths to bank disintermediation. This study contributes critical insights into the evolving competition between digital currencies and established financial infrastructures, highlighting the transformative potential of CBDCs on the broader economy.\\n\\n\\n\\nKeywords: CBDC, UPI, disintermediation, digital payments\\n\\nJEL Classification: E42, G21, G51, G38\\n\\nSuggested Citation:\\nSuggested Citation\\n\\nMarco Di Maggio\\n\\nImperial College Business School  ( email )\\n\\nSouth Kensington CampusExhibition RoadLondon SW7 2AZ, SW7 2AZUnited Kingdom\\n\\nHOME PAGE: http://marcodimaggio.net\\n\\nNational Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)  ( email )\\n\\n1050 Massachusetts AvenueCambridge, MA  02138United States\\n\\nPulak Ghosh\\n\\nIndia Institute of Management  ( email )\\n\\nBannerghatta RoadBangalore, Karn 560076BangaloreIndia\\n\\nSoumya Ghosh\\n\\nState Bank of India  ( email )\\n\\nIndia\\n\\nAndrew Wu (Contact Author)\\n\\nHarvard Business School  ( email )\\n\\nDo you have a job opening that you would like to promote on SSRN?\\n\\nPaper statistics\\n\\nRelated eJournals\\n\\nEmerging Markets: Finance eJournal\\n\\nEmerging Markets: Finance eJournal\\n\\nSubscribe to this fee journal for more curated articles on this topic\\n\\nCryptocurrency Research eJournal\\n\\nCryptocurrency Research eJournal\\n\\nSubscribe to this free journal for more curated articles on this topic\\n\\nHousehold Finance eJournal\\n\\nHousehold Finance eJournal\\n\\nSubscribe to this fee journal for more curated articles on this topic\\n\\nMonetary Economics: Central Banks - Policies & Impacts eJournal\\n\\nMonetary Economics: Central Banks - Policies & Impacts eJournal\\n\\nSubscribe to this fee journal for more curated articles on this topic\\n\\nMonetary Economics: Financial System & Institutions eJournal\\n\\nMonetary Economics: Financial System & Institutions eJournal\\n\\nSubscribe to this fee journal for more curated articles on this topic\\n\\nInvesting eJournal\\n\\nInvesting eJournal\\n\\nSubscribe to this fee journal for more curated articles on this topic\\n\\nPolitical Economy - Development: Fiscal & Monetary Policy eJournal\\n\\nPolitical Economy - Development: Fiscal & Monetary Policy eJournal\\n\\nSubscribe to this fee journal for more curated articles on this topic\\n\\nSSRN Quick Links\\n\\nSSRN Rankings\\n\\nAbout SSRN\\n\\nAll content on this site: Copyright \\u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc., its licensors, and contributors.

This article explores the dynamic relationship between traditional monetary instruments and new digital currencies, considering the transformative impact and regional nuances of CBDC. The article provides a historical overview of the evolution of the development and implementation of CBDC in the world, analyzes the key factors affecting its implementation in different regions, identifies key technological advances that are the disruptive force of QFS, as well as their impact on the transformation of traditional financial transactions. In the context of the development of CBDC and QFS, the legal frameworks that regulate their work, facilitate or hinder their broad integration into existing financial systems, their impact on traditional monetary policy and, accordingly, on economic stability, inflation and interest rates, and the format of the technological infrastructure are determined, which must be ensured for their successful implementation and operation, as well as the main challenges related to this and ways to solve security and privacy problems in their application. The paper combines qualitative and quantitative analysis to provide a comprehensive and validated dataset for a thorough understanding of digital financial paradigms. Qualitative research was conducted based on structured interviews with experts in the development and implementation of CBDC and QFS, as well as reporting and analytical information on central banks, regulators, and other financial institutions. The empirical study is based on the built OLS model, which describes the dependence coefficient using CBDC (the share of the population that uses it) on the traditional interest rate set by the central bank (taking into account the corrections for the possibility of variation of its changes and unobservable factors). The Python programming language with R libraries and the Stata software package are used for modeling. Tests confirmed the model\\u2019s statistical significance and high R-squared value (0.756 ) to begin its ability to explain a significant portion of the variability in CBDC adoption rates. The results showed that, on average, per skin unit increase in the traditional interest rate, post-CBDC rate growth is expected to be 1.74%; when the conventional interest rate is zero, the settlement rate after CBDC is 11.14%. The results of this study can be used to predict the dynamics of public perception of digital currencies. In addition, central banks can adjust interest rates to stimulate or moderate the adoption of CBDCs based on broader strategic macroeconomic measures: 1) during economic downturns, higher interest rates can be used to stimulate the adoption of digital currencies as an alternative financial instrument; 2) during periods of economic growth, interest rates may be lowered to mitigate the intended overheating of CBDC adoption.Keywords:digital currency, central bank, quantum financial system, acceptance of digital currencies, monetary policy, cryptocurrencies, interest rate.JEL Classification:E41, E42, E51, E58, G28, O31.Cite as:Shafranova, K., Navolska, N., Koldovskyi, A.

CBDCs present promising opportunities alongside\\nsignificant challenges, making them a key area for continued research, policy formulation, and\\ninnovation.\\nKeywords: Digital Currencies, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), Financial Inclusion,\\nBlockchain Technology.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThis paper is dedicated to a highly topical and dynamic topic in the field of financial technology:\\nthe development and introduction of digital currencies by central banks.\\nDevelopment of digital currencies\\nThe development of digital currencies, known as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), has\\nbeen a topic of significant interest and change in recent years. Digital currencies have experienced\\na rapid increase in popularity and acceptance. Initially, digital currencies were viewed primarily\\nas a novel concept with limited practical application. However, with the introduction of Bitcoin in\\n2009, the digital currency landscape began to change (Boros & Horv\\u00e1th, 2022).\\nEuropean Journal of Business, Economics and Accountancy Vol. 12, No. 1, 2024\\nISSN 2056-6018\\nProgressive Academic Publishing, UK Page 2 www.idpublications.org\\nThe concept of digital currencies has grown from a niche interest to a global phenomenon, with a\\nwide range of cryptocurrencies now available on the market. The development of digital currencies\\nhas been facilitated by advances in computer science and technology, particularly in the areas of\\nblockchain and cryptography.\\nThe use of digital currencies has raised important considerations regarding their regulation and\\nintegration into existing financial systems. As digital currencies become more widespread, the\\nneed to address issues related to security, privacy and regulatory compliance grows. Additionally,\\nthe emergence of central bank digital currencies has further shaped the digital currency landscape,\\nwith several countries exploring the possibility of issuing their own digital currencies (Riexinger\\net al., 2023).\\nMotivation to introduce a CBDC\\nThe introduction of central bank digital currencies is motivated by several factors. First, CBDCs\\nare seen as a possible tool to promote financial inclusion. It is argued that a well-designed and\\nimplemented CBDC can provide a viable solution to the problems of financial inclusion in\\ndifferent regions as it can digitize value chains, improve access to digital financial services, and\\nincrease the efficiency of digital payments (Ozili, 2021).\\nSecond, the adoption of CBDCs is motivated by the potential to modernize payment systems and\\nimprove the efficiency of financial transactions. CBDCs can offer low transaction costs and can\\nbe used offline when there is no internet connection, which can significantly improve the\\naccessibility and efficiency of digital payments (Ozili, 2021). In addition, the digitalization of\\ngovernment and the transition to a \\u201ccashless\\u201d society are also driving the discussion about CBDCs\\n(Hrytsai, 2023).\\nObjective & Relevance\\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies has led central banks to explore the potential of issuing their own\\ndigital currencies as a means of maintaining monetary sovereignty and managing the risks\\nassociated with private digital currencies (Opare & Kim, 2020).\\nAdditionally, potential impacts of CBDCs on monetary policy and financial stability are an\\nimportant motivating factor for their adoption. CBDCs can influence the transmission of monetary\\npolicy, and research has shown that the introduction of a CBDC has no adverse impact on banks'\\nlending activities and can even promote them (Andolfatto, 2018). Furthermore, the introduction of\\na CBDC allows the central bank to act as an intermediary on a large scale by competing with\\nprivate financial intermediaries for deposits (Fern\\u00e1ndez-Villaverde, 2020).\\nIn this work, various relevant countries are examined with regard to the introduction of CBDCs\\nand challenges and opportunities are developed and compared.\\nTheoretical framework\\nThis chapter explains the theoretical framework for central bank digital currencies, examines\\ndifferences to traditional currencies and analyzes potential impacts.\\nDefinition and characteristics of CBDC\\nThe definition and characteristics of CBDCs cover several key aspects. CBDCs can be defined as\\na form of digital or electronic currency that is issued by the central bank and represents a liability\\nEuropean Journal of Business, Economics and Accountancy Vol. 12, No. 1, 2024\\nISSN 2056-6018\\nProgressive Academic Publishing, UK Page 3 www.idpublications.org\\nof the central bank, but differs in its attributes from physical cash while performing the same\\nfunction as cash for payments (Goodell & Nakib, 2021).\\nThis distinction is important because it highlights the unique nature of CBDCs as a digital form of\\ncentral bank money that is risk-free and represents a liability on the central bank's balance sheet\\n(Goodell & Nakib, 2021).\\nIt is also important to consider the impact of CBDCs on financial inclusion, as they can potentially\\nimprove access to digital financial services and increase the efficiency of digital payments, while\\naddressing the challenges posed by private cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.

Benjamin Franklin famously printed currency with the phrase \\u201cto counterfeit is death\\u201d\\u2014and colonial England used fake currency to try to devalue the Continental Dollar during the American Revolution.\\nIn the modern era, security issues have multiplied with the rise of the Internet and the threat of cyberattacks. The United States Federal Reserve (Fed) considers cybersecurity a top priority and sees securing both the dollar and the international financial system as a core national security challenge. We are entering a new era of security and currency, one that requires responsible innovations in digital currency. This report examines the novel cybersecurity implications that could emerge if the United States issues a government-backed digital currency\\u2014known as a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or \\u201cdigital dollar.\\u201d\\nThis topic is fast-moving, consequential, and still somewhat nascent.\\nCBDCs have quickly landed on the international policy landscape. As of June 2022, according to Atlantic Council research, 105 countries representing 95 percent of the global GDP are researching and exploring the possible issuance of CBDCs. In the United States, spurred on by various domestic and international factors, the Fed has begun studying the issue and published a white paper in January 2022 that examines the potential benefits and risks of issuing a CBDC. In February 2022, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, released test code and key findings on what a possible US CBDC might look like. But the government has so far demurred on whether it will actually issue a digital dollar, calling upon Congress to authorize such a major decision. Further complicating matters is the rapid ascendance of privately issued crypto dollars, sometimes referred to as stablecoins, which now surpass $130 billion in total market capitalization. As Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard testified to the US House of Representatives\\u2019 Committee on Financial Services in May 2022, the recent collapse of the stablecoin TerraUSD raises new questions about the ways in which a CBDC could stabilize the digital asset ecosystem.\\nThe security of CBDCs has real-world import and is one of the major challenges to overcome if a CBDC is to be issued in the United States. Not just because of the classical counterfeiting scenarios or the possibility of a hacker looting the digital equivalent of Fort Knox, but also because a government-administered digital currency system could\\u2014depending on how it is designed\\u2014collect, centralize, and store massive amounts of sensitive data about individual Americans and granular details of millions of everyday transactions. For example, a CBDC could contain large volumes of personally identifiable information ranging from what prescription drugs you buy or where you travel each day. This could become a rich trove of data that could be stolen by advanced hackers or nation-states (similar to reams of personal data collected from federal employees that was stolen in 2016). Separately, other security issues could arise, for example, misuse or exfiltration of data by inside employees, smaller-scale identity theft, or \\u201cgray\\u201d charges via opaque fees. However, as our analysis shows, many of these risks already exist in the current system and could be mitigated through an effectively designed CBDC.\\nThe security of CBDCs has real-world import and is one of the major challenges to overcome if a CBDC is to be issued in the United States.\\nThe debate around CBDCs in the United States is also, relatively speaking, in its infancy, with the Fed and Treasury Department often taking the lead thus far, and several CBDC-related bills percolating through Congress. Part and parcel of the conversation about how and whether to develop a CBDC in the United States is what it will look like and how secure it could be. These intertwined questions of policy, design, and security should be an increasing focus of the conversation, both among federal agencies and between the executive branch and Congress. The United States can, and should, play a leading role in international standard setting. US President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\\u2019s recent executive order highlighted the importance of digital assets protecting democratic values.\\nThis report introduces key concepts, potential design trade-offs, and some policy principles that we hope can help federal stakeholders make foundational decisions around the future of CBDCs in the years ahead. While it is too early for a CBDC to be designed with ideal cybersecurity, efforts to dismiss a CBDC as uniquely and categorically vulnerable to cyberattacks have overstated the risk. This report puts forward a road map for policy makers to build secure CBDCs.\\nThis report examines the novel cybersecurity implications that could emerge if the United States or another country issues a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Central banks consider cybersecurity a major challenge to address before issuing a CBDC. The United States Federal Reserve (Fed) sees securing both the dollar and the international financial system as a core national security imperative. According to Atlantic Council research, currently 105 countries have been researching and exploring the possible issuance of CBDCs, with fifteen in pilot stage and ten fully launched.1\\u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency Tracker,\\u201d Atlantic Council, last updated June 2022,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/.Of the Group of Twenty (G20) economies, nineteen are exploring a CBDC with the majority already in pilot or development. This raises immediate questions about cybersecurity and privacy. A government-issued digital currency system could, but does not necessarily need to, collect, centralize, and store massive amounts of individuals\\u2019 sensitive data, creating significant privacy concerns. It could also become a prime target for those seeking to destabilize a country\\u2019s financial system.\\nThis report analyzes the intertwined questions of policy, design, and security to focus policy makers on how to build secure CBDCs that protect users\\u2019 data and maintain financial stability. Our analysis shows that privacy-preserving CBDC designs are not only possible, but also come with inherent security advantages, compared to current payment systems, that may reduce the risk of cyberattacks. Divided into three chapters, the report:\\n(1) provides a brief background on the Fed\\u2019s process as a baseline for central banks\\u2019 current cybersecurity measures;\\n(2) explores the novel cybersecurity implications of different potential CBDC designs in depth; and\\n(3) outlines legislative and regulatory principles for policy makers in the United States and beyond to set the conditions for secure CBDCs.\\nCurrent wholesale and retail payment systems face a complex cybersecurity landscape and represent a major point of attack for both organized crime and state-sponsored actors. Cybersecurity risks posed by CBDCs must be assessed relative to this landscape.\\nA targeted attack on wholesale payment infrastructures, such as the Fed\\u2019s domestic funds transfer system, Fedwire, could cause major global financial shocks, including severe liquidity shortfalls, commercial bank defaults, and system-wide outages that would affect most daily transactions and financial stability. There would also be secondary effects, including severe market volatility. To minimize the risk of cyberattacks and reduce the impact of successful hacks, the Fed\\u2019s current measures include regular contingency testing for high-volume and high-value Fedwire participants; redundancy requirements, such as backup data centers and out-of-region staff; and transaction value limits. Other risks for the wholesale payments infrastructure include attacks on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Telecommunications (SWIFT) messaging system. After recent attacks revealed significant vulnerabilities, SWIFT and its member banks have taken several steps to shore up their defenses, focusing on stronger security standards and quicker response.\\nKey cybersecurity risks for retail payment systems include credit and debit fraud, which collectively caused nearly $25 billion in damages in 2018 worldwide; fraud by system insiders affecting platforms like the Automated Clearing House (ACH) in the United States; and user error, such as falling prey to phishing scams. Risk management strategies for retail payments often rely on voluntary industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). To counter phishing and other types of user error, ACH and other platforms require unique user credentials and offer merchants additional steps like micro validation, tokenization and encryption, and secure vault payments.\\nIn sum, the various technical systems administered by the Fed, industry associations, and private banks already face c[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://academic.oup.com/cmlj/article/19/2/103/7615983: HTTP 403: Forbidden\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/attack-versus-defence-central-bank-digital-currencies-and-cybersecurity-threats/\\nTitle: Attack versus defence: central bank digital currencies and cybersecurity threats - Global Government Forum\\nContent:\\n\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/security-considerations-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency-20220203.html\\nTitle: The Fed - Security Considerations for a Central Bank Digital Currency\\nContent:\\nFebruary 03, 2022\\nTarik Hansen and Katya Delak1\\nThe concept of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) has gained traction in recent years, with an increasing number of central banks announcing efforts to explore CBDC use cases and designs. Institutions are in various stages of research and development, with some just beginning their research and others already entering pilot testing or even production, albeit on a limited scale. Discussions around CBDCs have included a variety of use cases and characteristics, including general-purpose and wholesale CBDCs, direct and indirect distribution of digital currency, and use of centralized and decentralized ledgers.\\nWhile there are many potential options for designing and implementing a CBDC, one important consideration that spans all the approaches is security. Like cash and conventional electronic payment systems, security considerations for a CBDC include the prevention of counterfeiting, fraud, and double spending. Given the likely importance of a CBDC to a jurisdiction's financial system and broader economy, other security considerations include anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, consumer protection, and financial stability.\\nA potential technology solution that is often discussed for a CBDC is distributed ledger technology (DLT).2The use of a decentralized ledger replicated across a distributed network could offer enhanced availability and minimize single points of failure, and the use of cryptographic hashes ensures the integrity of transaction records. While DLT may offer benefits, its use is not without security risks. For example, many of the purported benefits are associated with permissionless designs, yet security incidents involving these same designs demonstrate the continued existence of vulnerabilities.\\nRegardless of the technology used, security must remain an important consideration for a CBDC. The security considerations for a CBDC are not any different than those for conventional payment systems, online banking, and other financial activities. Attackers will continue to use phishing attacks and malware to obtain credentials or private keys, malicious insiders will continue to leverage their privileged access to steal assets, and nation-states will continue to engage in espionage to access information or wreak havoc on another nation's critical infrastructure. To prevent these attacks, a central bank issuing a digital currency must have a robust information security program in place.\\nWe begin this note by discussing why security is important for a CBDC. We then address how existing security frameworks can be used to design and implement a secure CBDC. Finally, for CBDC designs based on DLTs, we identify additional areas that a central bank should consider as part of its security-related activities during the system initiation and development phases.\\nSecurity is an important component of conventional electronic payment systems. It is no less critical in the design and implementation of a CBDC, where the ability to settle payments in real time and with immediate finality means that transactions cannot be easily stopped or reversed. While immediate and final settlement has existed in interbank payment systems for decades, it is more recent for retail payments. Security breaches from the systems that enable the use of CBDC could have immediate effects on payment systems and consumers. An attack or disruption of a CBDC arrangement may lead to follow-on effects that may pose broader risks to financial markets, economies, and currency-issuing institutions.\\nSupporting a Resilient Payment System\\nThe introduction of a CBDC may augment the existing payment infrastructure, which must operate in a smooth and efficient manner that enables secure transactions and prevents disruption in payment flows or erroneous or fraudulent payments. Settlement delays could result in the inability of businesses to make payments on goods and services and in potential credit and liquidity exposures, all having implications for financial stability. By adding a CBDC to payment systems, new networks and infrastructures increase the attack surface and have the potential to introduce new opportunities for disruptions.\\nBuilding Trust in a Payment Instrument\\nAn important aspect of any currency is trust, and a CBDC would not be successful without a secure platform that ensures user trust in the currency itself. A form of payment that is difficult to secure can be susceptible to counterfeiting, fraud, and double-spending, and is therefore unlikely to be adopted by merchants or consumers. The lack of trust and confidence in a currency could quickly reduce the value of that currency, disrupt businesses, and even destabilize economies and governments.\\nIn the case of physical currency, the prevalence of counterfeits presents a significant threat to trust in cash as a payment instrument. For example, the Continental currency notes issued by the Continental Congress in 1775 to finance the Revolutionary War were easy to counterfeit and quickly lost their value, ultimately leading to the coining of the phrase \\\"not worth a Continental.\\\"3To address the problem of counterfeiting, banknote printers and issuing authorities incorporate a variety of anti-counterfeiting mechanisms into the payment instrument itself. For example, many banknotes include physical characteristics, such as watermarks, color shifting inks, and holograms, so consumers and businesses can visually evaluate a banknote's legitimacy.\\nIn addition to potential counterfeiting, a CBDC may be subject to fraud and double spending, which could weaken trust in a CBDC. Like the anti-counterfeiting measures used for physical currency, a variety of measures would need to be incorporated into a CBDC to prevent users from copying, modifying, or double spending the same asset. In the digital context, these measures could likely involve leveraging cryptography to confirm identities and authenticity of the asset or token rather than the watermarks and other security features designed to prevent the counterfeiting of physical banknotes. A general-purpose CBDC used by consumers would also need to incorporate secure applications used for managing end user CBDC assets.\\nProtecting End User Asset and Sensitive Personal Information\\nWhile the level of personally identifiable information (PII) collected from users will vary widely depending on the implementation, a general-purpose CBDC would likely involve the collection and storage of sensitive PII and information about users' financial transactions. Given the sensitivity of this information, central banks and other institutions involved in the implementation of a CBDC would need to ensure this information is securely held to prevent harm to consumers from fraud and theft arising out of stolen PII as well as unauthorized disclosure of information. These entities would also need to ensure compliance with various privacy and recordkeeping laws.\\nPreventing Reputational Harm to a Central Bank\\nA CBDC that does not operate seamlessly, whether due to operational disruptions or prevalence of fraud, may ultimately result not only in a loss of trust in the digital currency instrument itself, but also in damage to the reputation of the central bank. A common role of many central banks is operating robust and resilient payment infrastructure. A central bank that experiences security problems with its CBDC could face challenges fulfilling this responsibility, resulting in harm to its reputation and the services it provides. Additionally, its ability to fulfill other responsibilities, such as maintaining monetary and financial stability, may also be affected.\\nA central bank must place security considerations among its top priorities for a CBDC. Bearing in mind that a CBDC is built upon information systems, it is useful to consider the risk-management approaches that ensure security in those systems. Securing a CBDC would entail conducting risk assessments and carrying out appropriate protective measures to manage and mitigate identified risks. The key risk areas are typically cast in terms of threats to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data that is stored, maintained, and exchanged throughout the system. These characteristics\\u2014confidentiality, integrity, and availability\\u2014are commonly referred to as the CIA triad and are baseline security requirements for information systems. Risk management involves fortifying protections to CIA in one way or another, and many comprehensive security frameworks exist to assist organizations in securing the CIA of their systems to support mission/business functions.\\nWhile the potential realization of a CBDC is novel, many of the underlying technologies that may be used for a CBDC are not new. Therefore, many of the protections for existing payment systems may be applied to CBDCs. These protections are built upon select security and operational frameworks that guide system operators through risk assessments and the subsequent implementation of security controls based on the sensitivity of the data stored on the information system. These frameworks are intended to be flexible and non-prescriptive, allowing information security professionals discretion in assessing risk, putting appropriate protections in place, and managing response to security incidents.\\nMany of these frameworks are likely broad enough to cover most, if not all, aspects of any CBDC implementation regardless of architecture or characteristics. A central bank should leverage one or more of these frameworks to ensure necessary security controls are in place prior to production roll-out of the system. Some of the most-used risk and security frameworks, guidance, and standards are discussed below. Other frameworks may also be applicable, and the list below is by no means exhaustive nor necessarily sufficient.\\nGeneral Risk Management Guidance\\nNIST Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF)4\\n[TOO LONG, END]\\n\""

As central banks globally explore the possibilities of CBDCs, their progress, challenges, and potential impact on traditional banking are subjects of significant interest and debate.\\nProgress in CBDC Development:\\nSeveral central banks around the world are actively researching and experimenting with CBDCs. China, with its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) project, has made substantial strides, piloting CBDCs in various cities and testing their application in real-world scenarios. Other countries, including the United States, the European Union, and Japan, are also exploring the development of CBDCs, each with its unique approach and considerations.\\nThe potential benefits of CBDCs include increased efficiency in payment systems, enhanced financial inclusion, and the ability for central banks to have more direct control over monetary policy. However, these advantages come with their own set of challenges and considerations.\\nChallenges in CBDC Implementation:\\nTechnological Infrastructure: Developing a secure and scalable technological infrastructure is a primary challenge in CBDC implementation. The distributed ledger technology (DLT) or blockchain, often considered for CBDCs, must accommodate large transaction volumes while ensuring robust security measures to prevent cyber threats.\\nPrivacy Concerns: CBDCs raise concerns about privacy, as digital transactions can potentially be traced more easily than traditional cash transactions. Striking a balance between privacy and regulatory oversight is crucial to ensure public trust in the new digital currency.\\nCross-Border Compatibility: For CBDCs to realize their full potential, they need to be interoperable across borders. This requires international cooperation and the development of common standards to facilitate cross-border transactions seamlessly.\\nImpact on Commercial Banks: The introduction of CBDCs may disrupt the traditional banking sector. If consumers opt to hold CBDCs directly with the central bank, it could reduce the amount of funds held in commercial banks, impacting their ability to lend and potentially altering the dynamics of the traditional banking system.\\nPotential Impact on Traditional Banking:\\nChanging the Payments Landscape: CBDCs have the potential to revolutionize the payments landscape by offering a faster, more efficient, and cost-effective alternative to traditional payment systems. This could lead to a decline in the use of physical cash and traditional banking services for day-to-day transactions.\\nFinancial Inclusion: CBDCs can address issues of financial inclusion by providing a digital currency accessible to individuals who may not have access to traditional banking services. This can bridge the gap between the banked and unbanked populations, fostering greater economic participation.\\nMonetary Policy Tools: CBDCs grant central banks more direct control over monetary policy. With the ability to implement negative interest rates or distribute funds directly to citizens, central banks can respond more effectively to economic challenges. However, this also requires careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences.\\nCommercial Banks' Role Redefined: The introduction of CBDCs may redefine the role of commercial banks. If consumers can hold digital currency directly with the central bank, traditional banks may need to adapt their business models, potentially focusing more on value-added services rather than serving as custodians of deposits.\\nConclusion:\\nAs central banks advance in their exploration and implementation of CBDCs, the financial landscape is on the brink of significant transformation. The progress made in CBDC development is a testament to the potential benefits these digital currencies could bring, from increased efficiency to financial inclusion. However, the challenges, including technological hurdles, privacy concerns, and the potential impact on traditional banking, must be navigated carefully.\\n*Join our WhatsApp Channel to get the latest news, exclusives and videos on WhatsApp*\\n_____________\\nDisclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

To date, only a few countries have initiated the issuance of this innovative and hybrid medium of exchange (Cambodia, Bahamas, Singapore, China, Uruguay, Caribbean), most of them still at the experimental stage. However, many other central banks are on the way of doing it, such as the Federal Reserve (FED) and the European Central Bank (ECB). Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are stable units of value, fully backed by central banks. However, like their private crypto counterparts, they enable real-time transactions at no cost. Because they create a direct link between central banks and consumers, they offer new levers for monetary policies. They also facilitate the tracing of transactions and payers, which is likely to generate new business practices. At the same time, they provide governments with a formidable tool for controlling people's money, with the ability to directly withdraw or block funds based on social or discriminatory criteria.\\n\\nKeywords\\n\\nCBDC, Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Digital Money, Monetary Policy, E-Wallet.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThanks to Bitcoin and the emergence of other cryptocurrencies, a new and fully digital way of paying and transferring money has been discovered. Indeed, initially perceived as the means of payment for illegal activities, and reserved for well trained and IT-familiar individuals, cryptocurrencies have gradually aroused the interest of many other people, companies and even institutions because they presented undeniable advantages: contrary to what one might think, most cryptos are very transparent and trace all transactions; they also enable virtually real-time and inexpensive cross-border transactions.\\n\\nHowever, even with these advantages, the high volatility of cryptos makes them unreliable for daily use. Even \\u201cstablecoins,\\u201d that is, cryptos that are backed by fiat money or short-term bills, are limited because they are issued by private companies and come with certain liquidity risks. For this reason, fiat money is still essential, however, cryptos have shown governments how far digitization could go. In doing so, they paved the way for a much more ambitious central bank money, with enhanced capabilities:\\n\\n1. Real time transfers and payments\\r\\n  2. Reliable and real time settlements\\r\\n  3. Intuitive digital e-wallets, to store and use digital money\\r\\n  4. Payments and transfers at no cost, with no borders\\r\\n  5. Transaction tracing, with associated data processing\\n\\nSuch a shift in our financial landscape has forced countries and central banks to reshape their concept of currencies to stay in the race for the digitalization and internationalization of money. The adoption of bitcoin as an official currency by countries like Japan or El Salvador has reinforced this decision. Major central banks are now planning to issue their own decentralized digital currency before 2025. Such e-money, called Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), mixes both the characteristics of cryptocurrencies (with real-time payments and settlement) and the stability of traditional fiat money.\\n\\nIn the following parts of the article, we first discuss the definition of money, explain what technological innovations cryptocurrencies have brought about, and how they could contribute to a new class of central bank digital currencies. We then expand on what CBDC is and the changes in consumption, payments, and state control it could bring in our societies.\\n\\nThe Cryptocurrency Revolution\\n\\nThe definition of money and the place of cryptocurrency\\n\\nEconomists do not all agree on a single definition of money but in the most widely spread definition, money serves three functions: it is a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account.\\n\\nTo fulfill these three functions, money can take a variety of forms, including non-perishable goods, non-financial assets, and financial assets (Claeys and al., 2018). Various goods and assets have been used as money. Some have been successful while others have led to monetary instability and thus have been replaced. Therefore, money can vary both in its characteristics and in its relative success in fulfilling its three main functions Figure 1.\\n\\nFigure 1: The Taxonomy Of Money.\\n\\nSource: Bruegel based partly on the typology proposed by Bech and Garratt (2017).\\n\\nMore precisely, money can take several forms and have several origins: it can be issued by private companies or governments, it can be digital or physical and, be centralized or decentralized (Bech and Garratt, 2017).\\n\\nCryptocurrencies are decentralized digital currencies, initiated by private companies or individuals. They represent a form of money that did not exist before, as a special combination in monetary taxonomy.\\n\\nWhile cryptocurrencies can practically serve as a medium of exchange, they are still not seen as money because of several of their characteristics. Indeed, if we look at the most famous cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, they have a rigidly inflexible supply which make them wildly fluctuate in demand and price. They thus appear too unstable to be used as a unit of account. However, they have the potential to serve as a store of value, due to their low supply growth, backed by the network\\u2019s distributed protocol, and their credible demonstration over time of the absence of any authority able to alter such supply schedule (Ammous, 2018). Even though other cryptocurrencies like Tether USD or USDC are more stable and theoretically backed by real USD dollars or short-term notes, they rely on a centralized and private control, with uncertainty as to the reality of this back support Auer & Boehme (2021).\\n\\nDespite these limitations, but given the incredible benefits that cryptocurrencies bring, many central banks have started or are planning to issue their CBDCs. To do this, they are inspired by the technological design of cryptocurrencies, which is based on Distribution Ledger technology and Blockchain Auer et al. (2021) Auer, Frost (2021)..\\n\\nTechnical overview of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger technologies (DLT)\\n\\nCryptocurrencies work on the principle of blockchains, a sub-category of the distributed ledger technology (DLT). Such technology was invented and disclosed with the very first cryptocurrency called bitcoin.\\n\\nIn cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, a network of participants shares a database called \\u201cledger\\u201d, that includes all the \\u201cbank accounts\\u201d that have owned or currently owns bitcoins. Such database increases in time, at a regular pace, to include the new transactions made. Instead of being centralized like in a bank, the bitcoin database is public and shared across the globe with anyone running the bitcoin protocol and willing to have a copy of this ledger on its computer. This protocol is often called the \\u201cvalue protocol\\u201d because it enables the transfer of valuable assets through the internet.\\n\\nTo make the bitcoin system function, all bitcoin network participants \\u2013 called \\u201cnodes\\u201d \\u2013 share the previously described ledger which contains all the history of bitcoin transactions. All the nodes run the same protocol \\u2013 the bitcoin core \\u2013 which contains consensus rules according to which a new block with new transactions is added to the ledger every 10 minutes. Because it is built in the form of successive blocks, the ledger is called a \\u201cblockchain\\u201d in the case of cryptocurrencies. The immutability of a blockchain ledger is both ensured by the high number of network participants that validate the transactions and by a cryptographic fingerprint \\u2013 called hash (Haber and Scott, 1997) \\u2013 which is added at the top and bottom end of any new block. This \\\"hash\\\" makes it easy and quick to verify that no past transaction has been changed in the shared ledger.\\n\\nSource: adapted by the author from https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/distributed-ledger-technology/\\n\\nThe advantage of a distributed ledger, compared to a centralized one, is that it exists across several locations and among multiple participants. Because it is decentralized, it eliminates the need for a central authority or intermediary to validate or authenticate transactions. Enterprises use distributed ledger technology to process, validate or authenticate.\\n\\nA blockchain is thus a particular distributed ledger that takes the form of a sequence of blocks, and in which each additional block does not change the content of the previous ones. It gives more security because it conserves the whole history of past transactions and account balance Figures 2 & 3.\\n\\nFigure 2: Blockchain And Crypto Protocols Compared To Traditional Tcp/Ip.\\n\\nFigure 3:Distributed Ledger Technology: A Ledger Is Shared And Synchronized Across Internet.\\n\\nPermissionless Versus Permissioned Blockchains\\n\\nA permissionless blockchain, like the largest public ones Ethereum and Bitcoin, is a distributed ledger in which anyone can participate in consensus, write new blocks or access data without any control. Consensus mechanisms in permissionless blockchains consist in protocols that make all participants agree on the transactions that must be validated and included in the successive blocks of the blockchain.\\n\\nUnlike fully public blockchains where anyone can access the ledger and view their transactions, in a permissioned blockchain all members of the system must be authorized. Such types of distrib[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.chaintech.network/blog/the-role-of-cbdcs-in-modernizing-monetary-policy/\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nCurrent Date\\n\\nThe Role of CBDCs in Modernizing Monetary Policy\\n\\nCBDCs and monetary policy are quite topical in the financial world. Digital currency, with an almost similar analogy, means digital money issued and controlled by central banks. It\\u2019s not just a new kind of payment; it represents a tool aimed at transforming the way a government runs its economy.\\n\\nA study shows that traditional monetary policies often face delays and inefficiencies. CBDCs can solve these issues. They bring faster payments, more transparency, and better access for people without bank accounts. Imagine getting financial aid directly into a digital wallet instead of waiting for checks. That\\u2019s the power of CBDCs.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s explore how they are changing monetary policy.\\n\\nWhat are CBDCs?\\n\\nCBDCs refer to the digital version of a country\\u2019s currency. They are issued by the central banks and guaranteed by the government. Unlike the cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, CBDCs are centrally controlled and regulated.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s why they matter:\\n\\nChina is experimenting with the digital yuan, and Sweden is working on the e-Krona.\\n\\nHow CBDCs change cross-border transactions\\n\\nNo doubt, the biggest hurdles to global finance lie in an efficient, cheap, and secure cross-border payment system. Traditional systems rely on diaries\\u2014including banks and payment processors\\u2014that take days and charge high fees. The good thing here is that CBDCs eliminate such intermediaries and allow direct transfer between parties.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s how CBDCs change the game:\\n\\nFor example, businesses involved in international trade could reduce transaction times from days to minutes using CBDCs, improving cash flow and efficiency.\\n\\nCBDCs vs. Traditional monetary policy tools\\n\\nFeature | Traditional Tools | CBDCs\\nPolicy Execution Speed | Slow; relies on banking systems | Instant, direct implementation by central banks\\nAccessibility | Limited to banked populations | Available to unbanked populations via mobile devices\\nTransparency | Limited; requires audits | High; real-time tracking on blockchain\\nCross-Border Payments | Expensive and slow | Cheap and fast\\nCost Efficiency | High costs due to intermediaries | Lower costs; fewer intermediaries involved\\nThis comparison shows how CBDCs address the inefficiencies of traditional monetary tools while\\n\\nWhy traditional monetary policy needs help\\n\\nTraditional monetary policy has served economies for decades. But it\\u2019s not perfect. Here are some common problems:\\n\\nThese challenges clearly indicate that we need better tools. That\\u2019s where CBDCs enter the scene.\\n\\nHow CBDCs revamp monetary policy.\\n\\nCBDCs fix many problems with traditional systems. They make monetary policies faster, more efficient, and more accessible.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s how:\\n\\nFor example, during a crisis, governments can quickly send relief funds through CBDCs. This ensures timely support without delays caused by banks.\\n\\nBenefits of CBDCs to the world economy\\n\\nThe following are the benefits that central banks offer with CBDCs:\\n\\nThe Bahamas has adopted the Sand Dollar to enhance access to banking in hard-to-reach places, and, in this case, real problems are being solved directly by CBDCs.\\n\\nDid you know?\\n\\nOver 100 countries are exploring CBDCs, of which most are now in advanced pilots\\u2019 stages, and seek to revolutionize the monetary system.\\n\\nPotential risks and challenges\\n\\nHowever, they also pose challenges:\\n\\nGovernments must balance these risks with the benefits to ensure successful implementation.\\n\\nCase studies: CBDCs in action\\n\\nSeveral countries are testing or using CBDCs:\\n\\nExamples show how countries have used their CBDCs to solve problems.\\n\\nCBDCs and monetary policy in the future\\n\\nCBDCs will only alter the ways people think about global finance.\\n\\nThese will not replace the traditional systems immediately but complement and make them better.\\n\\nA digital future for monetary policy\\n\\nBut beyond the notion of a digital money system, CBDCs enable the wide-scale modernization of government management of economies. And in addressing inefficiencies in traditional systems, CBDCs speed up, democratize, and open up monetary policy.\\n\\nIt is not just a fad about digital currencies, as CBDCs represent an inevitable trend for both governments and individuals.\\n\\nGet ahead of the curve. The future of finance is in front of us, and CBDCs are at the forefront.\\n\\nDid you know?\\n\\nCBDCs can help reduce fraud and corruption since all flows of funds will be fully traceable and transparent.\\n\\nFAQs\\n\\n1. What are CBDCs, and in what respect are they supportive of monetary policy?\\n\\nThe CBDCs refer to those currencies issued by the central banks in digital forms. They better their monetary policy through quickening and efficient management of money.\\n\\n2. Comparing CBDCs and cryptocurrencies?\\n\\nCBDCs must be regulated based on the currency of the country, whereas the latter has no regulation, and most are highly volatile.\\n\\n3. Are CBDCs safe to use?\\n\\nYes, CBDCs are built on secure technologies like blockchain. However, they require strong cybersecurity measures.\\n\\n4. Which countries have led the development of CBDCs?\\n\\nMore leading nations include the Bahamas, Sweden, and China.\\n\\n5. Will CBDCs replace cash?\\n\\nNot anytime soon. CBDCs will probably run in parallel with cash and other modes of payment.\\n\\nRelated Posts:\\n\\nRemittance Market: CBDCs and Their Transformative Potential\\n\\nPublished By : afia-ctn\\n\\nThe Security and Privacy Concerns Surrounding CBDCs\\n\\nPublished By : afia-ctn\\n\\nExploring The Pros And Cons Of CBDCs For Everyday Consumers\\n\\nPublished By : afia-ctn\\n\\nShare This\\u2026\\n\\nRecent Post\\n\\nParrot 6.3: What\\u2019s New in the Latest Ethical Hacking OS?\\n\\nUBS Tests Blockchain to Democratize Digital Gold: Can India\\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Gold Market Go Digital?\\n\\nGoogle security warns AI hacking threatens 2.5 billion Gmail users\\n\\nCBDC Banned in US: How Stablecoins Shapes Global Finance\\n\\nErrol Musk\\u2019s \\u2018Musk It\\u2019: Will It Soar or Crash in the Crypto Market?\\n\\nNever Miss A Post!\\n\\nSign up for free and be the first to get notified about updates.\\n\\nFeatured Videos\\n\\nCONTACT US\\n\\nLet's make waves together!\\n\\nIndia\\n\\nNEWSLETTER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://www.supermoney.com/encyclopedia/cbdc: HTTP 403: Forbidden\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://paxful.com/university/what-is-cbdc-crypto: HTTP 403: Forbidden\\n\""

To date, no member jurisdiction has yet decided to proceed with a retail CBDC.\\n\\nSince its formation, the group have published a report in October 2020 setting out the common foundational principles and core features of a CBDC, an executive summary and three detailed reports on system design and interoperability, user needs and adoption and financial stability implications in September 2021 and a note on policy perspectives in May 2023. The group has now progressed on better understanding selected key legal and system design aspects of retail CBDC which are summarised in the following two papers \\u2013 without drawing specific policy conclusions:\\n\\nThe legal paper examines some key legal questions that may need to be addressed by any jurisdiction considering issuing a retail CBDC but does not attempt to provide definitive answers to those questions. It focuses on four areas: the legal classification of retail CBDC; the obligations and liabilities of participants in the retail CBDC ecosystem; privacy and financial crime and cross-border issues.\\n\\nA jurisdiction considering issuing a retail CBDC might need to decide on the appropriate legislative, regulatory and contractual rules for its retail CBDC, having regard to its own legal framework, and its CBDC design and policy aims. Considerable legal work might be needed in each jurisdiction to identify and address the range of legal issues.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the system design paper provides some perspectives on overall system design and then focuses on four key issues for designing a well-functioning retail CBDC system: privacy, cyber security (including quantum computing), offline functionality and point of sale considerations. These issues are muti-dimensional and often interconnected. Given the scale of interconnectedness, both within and beyond the system, central banks may likely need to draw on expertise from both across their institutions, as well as from the private sector, to ensure a holistic approach.\\n\\nReflecting this, the group have worked closely across different topics. As part of this joint work, the group shares insights and perspectives gained from the central banks' individual analysis and experiments on a range of CBDC-themes.\\n\\nRelated information\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/cbdcs-will-need-to-work-across-borders-here-are-the-models-exploring-how-to-do-it/\\nTitle: Untitled\\nContent:\\nByAnanya KumarandAlisha Chhangani\\nToday, the Atlantic Council GeoEconomics Center released new findings from our flagshipCentral Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Trackershowing that 134 countries, representing 98 percent of global GDP, are exploring CBDCs. Countries are not just exploring retail CBDCs (a digital version of cash you can use to buy coffee). They are also prioritizing the development of cross-border and wholesale CBDCs, which can help bank-to-bank transfers acrosscountries. Development of CBDCs is not evenly distributed: large economies such as India, China, Japan, Singapore, and the Euro Area are significantly further ahead than their peers in the United States and UK. Moreover, since Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting financial sanctions, we have seen cross-border wholesale CBDCs, such as those developed by China, UAE, Thailand and Hong Kong (named Project mBridge) multiply and evolve. Across the twelve other cross-border projects in our research, includingProject DunbarandProject Mariana, we have documented the rise of specific country-blocs developing technology that sidesteps the existing financial system.\\nCentral banks and international financial institutions are realizing that uneven and dispersed technological advancements in digital currencies could actually create further fragmentation of the financial system, deepen digital divides, and create systemic risks. This would undercut the premise of digital currencies, which are supposed to create more efficiency in the existing system. Fortunately, there are some new models of interoperability across borders. A range of policymakers are trying to solve this looming problem, here are the current options:\\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) interoperability model, known as theXC platform,proposes a global centralized ledger to simplify and streamline cross-border payments. It wasreleasedin November 2022 as a theoretical project which extends the concept of wholesale CBDCs by integrating commercial banks, payment providers, and central banks into a unified, streamlined platform. The model\\u2019sgoalis to reduce transaction costs and settlement times.\\nThe platform proposes athree-layer architecture: a settlement layer that acts as the primary ledger, a programming layer for executing smart contracts, and an information layer designed to protect personal data while ensuring compliance and facilitating currency controls as needed. Instead of adopting CBDCs, central banks can issueCertificates of Escrow(CE) for use exclusively on the XC platform. These certificates share characteristics with CBDCs and can later be converted into central bank reserves by financial institutions. According to the IMF, a key advantage of using CEs is that it allows countries toprioritize domestic use casesfor their CBDC projects.Importantly, the XC model is built to be broadlycompatiblewith legacy systems, demanding relatively minimal technological adjustments from central banks. The XC model is a policy and regulatory framework, not a technical solution. It encourages countries to adopt consistent and supportive regulations for cross-border payments, potentially incorporating tokens and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). However, in order for the model to work, it will need compatible legal and regulatory frameworks to effectively manage risks and ensure compliance across various jurisdictions. Tobias Adrian, Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the IMF, furtherexplainedthis point at ourconferencein November 2023.\\nOur flagship Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Tracker takes you inside the rapid evolution of money all over the world. The interactive database now tracks over 130 countries\\u2014 triple the number of countries we first identified as being active in CBDC development in 2020.\\nTheBIS Universal Ledgerinteroperability model advocates for a shared global ledger that supports the issuance and transaction of both CBDCs and tokenized assets. Released just a day after the IMF updated its single ledger XC model, the BIS also aims to address the inefficiencies and silos present in the financial system by enabling safer transactions and atomic settlements within a transparent framework. In the report, the BISemphasizesthe role of trust in central bank digital currency projects in overcoming the limitations and fragmentation observed in current tokenization efforts.Unlike the XC model whichbuildson blockchain solutions, the BIS\\u2019s unified ledgerapproach uses APIs(application programming interfaces) creating a more centralized system where transactions have to be processed and validated by authorized entities, such as central banks or designated financial institutions. Within this system, central bank money can circulate on a platform that is not owned and operated by the central bank, which can present risks. It also raises questions about the security, control, and integrity of central bank money when it is managed outside the traditional central banking systems.\\nThe unified ledger model is already being piloted. In October 2023, South Korealauncheda wholesale CBDC pilot project exploring BIS\\u2019 unified ledger concept. With technical support from the BIS, commercial banks in South Korea utilize a wholesale CBDC for interbank funds transfers and final settlements. These banks will then issue tokenized deposits as payment instruments accessible to the general public within the CBDC network, which is jointly managed by the Bank of Korea (BOK) and other financial institutions in the country. BOK has also joined forces with the BIS Innovation Hub\\u2019s Singapore center on \\u201cProject Mandala\\u201d, which aims to integrate jurisdiction-specific policies and regulatory requirements into a universal protocol for international transactions like foreign investments and payments. This initiative seeks to develop a compliance-by-design architecture for more efficient cross-border transfers for CBDCs and tokenized deposits.\\nBuilding on its central role in global financial messaging,SWIFT\\u2019s innovation hub has introduced a model to enhance its existing infrastructure for cross-border payments, making them faster, more transparent, and cost-effective. Currently inbeta testing, this model facilitates the connection of disparate domestic CBDC networks, enabling them to communicate and transact with one another while leveraging SWIFT\\u2019s existing infrastructure and security protocols. The current project is running out of the innovation hub and would require a big operational shift to be expanded to the whole SWIFT ecosystem.\\nIn September 2023, SWIFTannouncedthe participation of three central banks\\u2014including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Central Bank of Kazakhstan, and one anonymous central bank\\u2014in the next beta phase of its CBDC interoperability project. The project, which initially began in March 2023 with over eighteen participants including MAS and the Banque de France, has now expanded to include more than thirty entities and has already processed over5,000 transactionsin a twelve-week period. This solution leverages SWIFT\\u2019s global reach and the existing network effects among financial institutions. It also offers flexibility for countries to maintain their own domestic CBDC infrastructure, while ensuring global connectivity. The model is best thought of as a hub-and-spoke arrangement between various central banks with SWIFT at the center.\\nThe IMF\\u2019s XC Model, BIS Unified Ledger, and SWIFT\\u2019s New Cross-Border Project each propose innovative approaches to enhancing cross-border payments, especially focused on addressing fragmentation in the payments system. The models themselves are in various stages of development and reflect a spectrum of solutions which envision varied new architectures, novel tokens, and different roles for the private sector and the public sector. These models do not exist in a vacuum, and are accompanied by parallel efforts by central banks (such asProject CedarX Ubin +andProject Mariana) and private companies (such as theRegulated Liabilities Network) to address similar issues of cross-border fragmentation.\\nThe XC Model and BIS Unified Ledger emphasize centralized architectures that focus on integrating existing financial structures with new technology. In contrast, SWIFT\\u2019s initiative seeks to adapt its role in traditional messaging infrastructure to connect CBDC networks, prioritizing interoperability and the reliability of established systems. All three frameworks are being designed to support both CBDCs and tokenized assets\\u2014creating one platform to exchange them all rather than separate networks. This \\u201ctoken agnosticism\\u201d reveals that these projects do not want to be overly prescriptive of the future financial system, and are in the early stages of development and testing.\\nEach of these initiatives reflects a different aspect of the evolving landscape of global finance, geared towards a push towards greater efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced security in cross-border transactions. A central question across these models is that of governance, as each of the proposed models envisions an operator of an inherently global system, a concept that is as blue-sky as it gets. This is going to prove difficult due to geopolitical disagreements, since the countries exploring CBDCs are neither aligned on the role of the existing global institutions at the center of the project, nor do they agree on a specific technological model. While these three models seem unified in their ultimate objective, these projects will have to get more specific about who governs, enforces, and creates the rules of the future of cross-border payments. The alternative is a replication of the existing frictions in our system\\u2014leading to less efficiency, higher cost, and a loss in trust in money.\\nDespite differences, these models reflect a clear realization in the public and private sector that as CBDCs become a part of the financial landscape, th[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://toxigon.com/regulatory-frameworks-for-cbdcs\\nTitle: Understanding Regulatory Frameworks for CBDCs: A Comprehensive Guide\\nContent:\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are poised to revolutionize the financial landscape, but their implementation is fraught with regulatory challenges. This guide delves into the complex world of regulatory frameworks for CBDCs, offering insights, examples, and practical advice to help you navigate this emerging field.\\nCBDCs are digital versions of a country's fiat currency, issued and backed by the central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are decentralized, CBDCs are controlled by central authorities. The appeal of CBDCs lies in their potential to enhance financial inclusion, reduce transaction costs, and improve the efficiency of payment systems.\\nWith the rise of CBDCs, there's an urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks. These frameworks are essential to ensure the security, stability, and integrity of the financial system. They also play a crucial role in protecting consumers, preventing financial crimes, and maintaining the trust of the public.\\nA comprehensive regulatory framework for CBDCs should address several key components:\\nDifferent countries are taking varied approaches to regulating CBDCs. Let's look at a few case studies:\\nChina\\u2019s Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) system, also known as the digital yuan, is one of the most advanced CBDC projects. The People's Bank of China has been piloting the digital yuan in several cities, with a focus on ensuring widespread adoption and acceptance. The regulatory framework includes strict controls to prevent financial crimes and ensure the stability of the financial system.\\nSweden\\u2019s Riksbank is exploring the e-Krona, a digital version of the Swedish krona. The regulatory framework for the e-Krona focuses on ensuring financial stability and consumer protection. The Riksbank is also working on technological standards to ensure the security and interoperability of the e-Krona.\\nThe Bahamas has already launched its CBDC, the Sand Dollar. The regulatory framework for the Sand Dollar includes measures to ensure financial inclusion and consumer protection. The Central Bank of the Bahamas has also implemented technological standards to ensure the security and interoperability of the Sand Dollar.\\nThe technology underlying CBDCs is a critical component of the regulatory framework. Key considerations include:\\nConsumer protection and privacy are paramount in the regulatory framework for CBDCs. Measures to protect consumers include:\\nCBDCs have the potential to impact financial stability and monetary policy. Regulatory frameworks must address these risks, including:\\nThe global nature of financial markets necessitates international coordination in the regulation of CBDCs. Key considerations include:\\nWhile CBDCs offer numerous benefits, they also present significant challenges and uncertainties. These include:\\nThe future of CBDCs is filled with exciting possibilities and innovations. Areas of focus include:\\nRegulatory frameworks for CBDCs are essential to ensure the security, stability, and integrity of the financial system. As CBDCs continue to gain traction, it is crucial for policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders to work together to develop comprehensive and effective regulatory frameworks. By addressing key components such as legal clarity, technological standards, consumer protection, financial stability, and international coordination, we can harness the potential of CBDCs while mitigating their risks.\\nCBDCs are digital versions of a country's fiat currency, issued and backed by the central bank.

This book explores the transformative effects of CBDCs on traditional banking institutions, examining both the challenges and opportunities they face. By analyzing global case studies, regulatory frameworks, and financial innovations, this book provides a comprehensive overview of how commercial banks must adapt to remain relevant in a digital economy. The financial world is at a turning point. The advent of CBDCs, backed by central banks, has raised critical questions about the role of commercial banks in the monetary ecosystem. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, CBDCs offer the promise of stability but also pose potential threats to traditional banking models. This book delves into how these institutions can navigate regulatory shifts, redefine business strategies, and leverage technology to sustain their influence. The history of money has undergone continuous evolution, from barter systems to fiat currency and now to digital assets. Commercial banks have long been intermediaries between central banks and the public, offering loans, deposits, and payment services. However, CBDCs present a new paradigm where central banks can interact directly with consumers, potentially diminishing the role of traditional banking institutions. The acceleration of digital financial services has increased the demand for real-time transactions, lower costs, and greater financial inclusion. As central banks begin piloting or implementing CBDCs, commercial banks are faced with existential dilemmas: \\u2022 Will CBDCs replace traditional deposits? \\u2022 How can banks maintain their profit margins? \\u2022 What technological adaptations must be undertaken? These pressing concerns drive the necessity for commercial banks to redefine their roles and find new avenues for innovation. This book differentiates itself by offering: 1. Comparative Analysis \\u2013 Examining CBDC implementations across various economies and their impact on commercial banks. 2. Strategic Frameworks \\u2013 Outlining how banks can adapt through regulatory compliance, digital transformation, and alternative financial services. 3. Future Roadmap \\u2013 Providing predictive insights into how commercial banks will coexist with CBDCs in the next decade.

Asdigital moneygrows, many central banks are looking into Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The U.S. Federal Reserve is still deciding, but countries like China are already testing them.\\nChina\\u2019s e-CNY pilot has seen 4.5 million merchant wallets. Meanwhile, cash use is dropping fast, especially in Europe. Norway now uses only 3% cash for payments. This makes a digital alternative more necessary.\\nBut what does this mean for our financial future? How will it affect cryptocurrency rules and our money systems?\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a big step forward in digital finance. They are a digital version of money, issued by central banks. This change aims to make our money system better by offering a new way to manage money.\\nCBDCs help with many financial tasks, making sure they are safe and backed by the government. They fill gaps in traditional banking. For example, in the U.S., 6% of adults don\\u2019t have a bank account, showing the need for better financial access.\\nWorldwide, there\\u2019s a lot of interest in CBDCs. Right now, 36 pilot projects are underway, with 8 G20 countries working on them. The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria have already started using CBDCs. Also, the BRICS nations are looking into using them too.\\nCBDCs are mainly two types:\\nRetail CBDCs focus on everyday transactions, while wholesale CBDCs aim to strengthen the financial system. Over 80% of the world\\u2019s central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, are studying CBDCs. This shows they are moving from just ideas to real use.\\nBut, there are things to think about with CBDCs. Like keeping the financial system stable, how they affectmonetary policy, privacy, and security. These issues are important as countries like the U.S. consider using CBDCs to improve theirpayment systems.\\nAsdigital moneychanges the financial world, it\\u2019s key to understand and deal with the challenges of CBDCs. This ongoing process shows a big change towards updatingpayment systemsworldwide.\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are becoming more popular worldwide. It\\u2019s important to know about their types and how they\\u2019re used. CBDCs mainly come in two forms: account-based and token-based systems. These are being adopted by many countries to meet economic and technological goals.\\nAccount-based CBDCs use accounts at a central bank for transactions. This approach ensures high security and transparency. It\\u2019s similar to traditional banking, needing ID verification for each transaction.\\nSweden and India are examples of countries using account-based CBDCs. Sweden is testing the e-krona, and India has the Digital Rupee for wholesale transactions.\\nToken-based CBDCs use digital tokens that are secure thanks toblockchain technology. These tokens don\\u2019t need central bank accounts. They are used for everyday transactions, like in China\\u2019s Digital Yuan and the Bahamas\\u2019 Sand Dollar.\\nMany countries are working on CBDC projects. They use different approaches:\\nCBDCs are shaped byblockchain technologyand meet specific economic needs. Each country creates its own solution based on its goals and capabilities.\\nIn recent years, theadoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)has grown fast. This is mainly because cash use is going down, especially since the pandemic. People are now using digital money more, pushing central banks to look into digital money options.\\nBy late 2020,86% of global central bankswere looking into CBDCs. By mid-2021,56 central bankswere openly working on them. This big interest comes from wanting to keep up with private sector innovations like cryptocurrencies.\\nCentral banks also want to play a key role in the financial world again. With digital money becoming common, there\\u2019s a need for safer and quickerpayment systems. CBDCs offer a secure, government-backed option that\\u2019s different from unstable cryptocurrencies.\\nAnother big reason is to makecross-border paymentseasier. Current internationalpayment systemsare slow and expensive. CBDCs aim to make these payments faster, cheaper, and clearer.\\nHow countries are handling CBDCs varies a lot. Only three countries, The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria, have launched a nationwide CBDC. But, many others are starting big pilots. China, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), and India are leading the way.\\nMany central banks see CBDCs as a way to keep markets fair. They want to counter the growing influence of big tech in finance. By creating CBDCs, central banks aim to keep the balance of power and protect the traditional financial system.\\nEven so, not all central banks agree on the need for CBDCs. But, more research shows the big impact CBDCs could have. They could change how we think about money and finance.\\nThe world is moving towards a cashless society. People prefer using electronic transactions more and more. About 130 countries are working on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Let\\u2019s explore the many advantages of CBDCs.\\nCBDCs make transactions faster and safer. They cut out the middlemen found in traditional banking, speeding up payments. This is great for online shopping and sending money to friends.\\nAlso, using digital currencies saves money. This makes them appealing to everyone involved.\\nCBDCs can change how people access banking. They help those without bank accounts get into the financial world. This is especially helpful in poor countries where banking is hard to get.\\nCBDCs have strong security to fight fraud and financial crimes. They use top-notch encryption to prevent fake money. They also protect your personal info with strict privacy rules.\\nCentral bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have a lot of potential, but they face big challenges. One major issue isprivacy concerns. People want to keep their financial activities private, but CBDCs might not offer that. Central banks need to handle personal info and transaction data securely, which raises questions about privacy.\\nAnother big problem is making sure CBDCs aretechnologically stable. They need to handle lots of transactions without any issues. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is seen as a solution because it\\u2019s secure and reliable. But, DLT also has its own security risks that need to be fixed.\\nThere\\u2019s also the risk of security breaches, which could harm payment systems and lose consumer trust. If payments don\\u2019t go through on time, it can cause problems like credit issues and liquidity problems. This affectsfinancial stability. Trust is key for CBDCs to work well; without a secure system, people won\\u2019t trust digital money.\\nTo keep CBDCs safe, we need a mix of old and new methods. We must use cryptography and secure apps to prevent fraud. We can also use security measures from traditional payment systems to help CBDCs. This includes risk assessment, protective steps, and how to handle security issues.\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are changingcross-border paymentsfor the better. They make transactions faster and cheaper. Today, many steps are needed to send money across borders, causing delays and high costs. CBDCs aim to make these steps fewer, making international money moves smoother and clearer.\\nCBDCs are key to makinginternational transactionseasy. The number of banks working together has dropped a lot. For example, the Americas (excluding North America) have seen over a 30% decline, while North America itself experienced a 10% decline. This shows we need better ways like CBDCs.\\nCBDCs could also change how we use money worldwide. The Swift network helps move 90% of payments in just an hour. But, the costs and slow speeds are big problems. The dollar\\u2019s big role incross-border paymentsshows how CBDCs could change things.\\nMany projects show CBDCs\\u2019 potential. Project Aber, for example, is a joint effort by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. It\\u2019s checking if a shared CBDC can help with cross-border trade and cooperation. The project shows CBDCs can make international trade and economic cooperation better and more stable.\\nAlso, the world is getting interested in using digital tokens for real assets, which could be worth $30.1 trillion by 2034. Trade finance assets are expected to be a big part of this. But, as of July 2021, no major country has launched a CBDC forcross-border payments. Most central banks are still looking at using CBDCs for domestic needs.\\nWorking together on CBDC design is important. It helps address risks like currency substitution and capital flow volatility. The Bank for International Settlements says over 90% of central banks are looking into CBDCs. This shows a big push to improvecross-border paymentsand shapeglobal payment systemsof the future.\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are changing how commercial banks and financial institutions work. As CBDCs become more common, these institutions must adapt and follow new rules. This ensures a smooth transition into the current banking systems.\\nCBDCs require banks to rethink their operations. Here are some expected changes:\\nAdapting to CBDCs means dealing with complex rules and laws. Key points include:\\nThefuture of transactionsis set to change with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). They are fast, secure, and easy to use. CBDCs will change the global financial system and how we make money.\\n\\nCBDCs could make our financial system better and faster. They let central banks control money better. This means they can react quicker to economic changes.\\nCBDCs also help people without bank accounts. They make sure everyone can use financial services. For example:\\nCBDCs are big globally. The European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of India are working on them. They aim to make transactions faster and more efficient.\\nCBDCs are also driven byinnovation in financial services. Worldline is working with the European Central Bank on the digital euro. This shows how big companies are helping shape the future.\\nStablecoins are also key in this new world. They are stable and safe, unlike other crypto[TOO LONG, END]\\n\""

        "value": "The introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) will significantly reshape the traditional banking system and impact financial stability over the next five years. This updated analysis incorporates recent insights and empirical data to address key concerns and highlights the complexities accompanying CBDC deployment.\n\n### 1. **Transformation of the Banking Landscape**\nCBDCs, as direct liabilities of central banks, offer a stable and government-backed alternative to commercial bank deposits. While previous interpretations hinted at simplistic models of consumer preference towards CBDCs, it is now critical to recognize the nuanced architectures that influence adoption. For instance, empirical findings suggest that a modest shift of deposits to CBDCs could strain banks that rely heavily on deposit funding, particularly smaller banks (source: ScienceDirect). Specific data indicates that a moderate conversion of deposits could lead to funding issues for deposit-dependent banks, potentially impacting their lending capabilities and overall profitability (source: ScienceDirect).\n\nNumbers from various experiments, such as those from Germany, show that even a low conversion rate of 20% of deposits to CBDCs could lead to significant disruptions in traditional banking models (Vollmar & Wening, 2024). Moreover, particular market behaviors in countries like China, which indicates a substantial integration of digital yuan into everyday transactions, provide evidence that the willingness to experiment with CBDCs varies across different demographics and economic contexts.\n\n### 2. **Financial Stability Concerns**\nThe potential for rapid withdrawals from commercial banks into CBDCs poses serious risks to financial stability. The phenomenon of \"digital bank runs,\" wherein consumers swiftly convert deposits to CBDCs during crises, could exacerbate liquidity crises (source: IMF Working Paper). For instance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised alarms that if CBDCs become popular, especially under stress, it might escalate bank deposit withdrawals leading to severe liquidity shortages (source: IMF). Case studies indicate the relationship between deposit outflows and banking crises, presenting a compelling argument for proactive central banking measures to limit such risks.\n\nNevertheless, emerging research suggests that CBDCs may help reduce leverage and enhance overall portfolio quality for banks in certain contexts, particularly in emerging economies where traditional banking systems are weaker (Luu et al., 2023). Successfully piloted CBDCs in numerous countries indicate that new digital currencies may contribute to financial stability rather than detract from it when managed prudently.\n\n### 3. **Monetary Policy Implications**\nCBDCs could transform the way monetary policy is executed. With direct consumer access to CBDCs, monetary authorities may find it easier to implement measures such as negative interest rates or direct fund distributions, effectively bypassing traditional banking intermediaries (source: International Monetary Fund and others). Current literature supports that CBDCs enhance the speed and transparency of monetary policy transmission, potentially leading to better economic outcomes during crises (source: Digital Finance).\n\nHowever, concerns remain regarding how CBDCs could disrupt established monetary frameworks. Market volatility due to unexpected monetary policies enabled by CBDCs could lead to unintended inflationary pressures if not carefully managed. Studies highlight the necessity for central banks to develop new operational frameworks to accommodate these changes and ensure that CBDCs do not cause excessive fluctuations in monetary supply or interest rates (source: ScienceDirect).\n\n### 4. **Enhanced Financial Inclusion**\nCBDCs have the potential to significantly boost financial inclusion, especially for populations underserved by traditional banking. For example, Nigeria\u2019s pilot CBDC program demonstrated marked increases in access to banking services among users lacking traditional accounts (source: Digital Finance). The ease of access, especially via mobile technologies, enables a larger sector of the populace to engage in financial activities, thereby broadening the economic base (source: World Economic Forum).\n\nEvidential support from CBDC trials across several emerging economies shows that active engagement with CBDCs leads to increased economic participation. This aspect not only fosters a more inclusive financial system but also enhances overall economic resilience.\n\n### 5. **Cybersecurity and Privacy Challenges**\nMitigating cybersecurity risks is critical as CBDCs integrate into the financial system. Recent findings indicate that without strong cybersecurity measures, CBDCs might become prime targets for cyberattacks, similar to existing vulnerabilities experienced within banking infrastructures (source: Atlantic Council). Therefore, robust frameworks ensuring integrity, confidentiality, and availability, often referred to as the \"CIA triad,\" must be established to maintain consumer trust in CBDCs (source: Federal Reserve).\n\nPrivacy concerns surrounding user data tracking also necessitate careful attention. Regulatory oversight and technologies that protect consumer privacy while ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations are challenging yet essential areas to address in the implementation of CBDCs. Innovative cryptographic techniques and privacy-preserving frameworks are being tested to balance these requirements (source: World Economic Forum).\n\n### 6. **Industry Adaptation and Innovation**\nTo compete in a landscape increasingly defined by CBDCs, traditional banks must adopt technological innovations and diversify service offerings. New business models leveraging CBDCs as part of an integrated financial ecosystem may help banks remain relevant. Collaborative efforts between banks and fintech firms could yield hybrid models that leverage both CBDCs and traditional banking services (source: Payline Data).\n\nStrategic adaptations need to focus on enhancing existing infrastructures and developing customer-centric services that can seamlessly integrate CBDC transactions with traditional offerings. Banks must also focus on regulation compliance, ensuring that their systems can interact efficiently with emergent digital currencies (source: TotalBitcoin).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while the introduction of CBDCs offers an array of transformative possibilities, it also brings substantial challenges that require meticulous planning by central banks and financial institutions. As CBDC initiatives continue to unfold, monitoring consumer behavior, ensuring robust cybersecurity, and maintaining financial stability must be prioritized. Policymakers and financial industry stakeholders should engage in continuous learning and adapt their frameworks to promote innovations that foster an inclusive and resilient digital economy."

Besides the functional monetary policy improvements purported by macro policy and financial stability research, most of the expected benefits of introducing CBDCs need more evidence to make a winning case for central bank digital currencies. Alternative literature partly focuses on the practical results from regulatory preparations and adoption challenges, while some scholars study relevant historical arguments for CBDCs. The socioeconomic impact of the digitalization of money, currency competition between private and public money, and direct access to central bank liabilities are vital themes that researchers focus on to bridge past research with the recent rise of digital currencies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nQuery: real-world examples of CBDC impact on bank profitability\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: Bank profitability and central bank digital currency\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443124001719\\nCONTENT: Bank profitability and central bank digital currency - ScienceDirect Bank profitability and central bank digital currency\\u2606 We examine the potential effect of CBDC on European bank profit.

Wholesale CBDCs: These are limited to financial institutions and aim to enhance interbank settlements, facilitate cross-border transactions, and improve the implementation of monetary policy whereby central banks have greater influence over liquidity management. Furthermore, centralized digital currencies create alarm over government surveillance and privacy of data whereby, in real-time, central banks could have control or keep record of financial transactions; most importantly, invasion in the infrastructure of CBDC will create a worldwide shock of financial instability that will have an impact on millions of users.Governments and financial institutions will have to set up well-structured mechanisms of robust encryption, fraud detection, and cyber defenses in order to safeguard their systems against threats.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Legal framework for Central Bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in Banking\\nURL: https://aishwaryasandeep.in/legal-framework-for-central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdcs-in-banking/\\nCONTENT: By examining real-world examples and anticipating future trends, this article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the legal landscape surrounding CBDCs in the banking sector. ...

This article will explore the impact of CBDCs on banks and analyze potential challenges and opportunities. CBDCs are digital fiat currencies that central banks issue on a centralized blockchain network. Central banks can significantly reduce the traditional role of banks as intermediaries by providing CBDCs directly to consumers and businesses. Central banks bear the responsibility of implementing and managing CBDCs. This transition represents a significant operational shift for central banks, requiring them to effectively adapt their processes and systems to accommodate digital currencies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nQuery: CBDC trials outcomes across various countries\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: 134 Countries Exploring CBDCs: 8 Major Findings You Should Know\\nURL: https://cryptoassetbuyer.com/134-countries-exploring-cbdcs/\\nCONTENT: By Jude Ayua.

Few have considered whether CBDC designs could mitigate risks or perhaps even improve the cybersecurity of a financial system. Our new research, published in the Atlantic Council\\u2019s recent report, titled \\u201cMissing Key\\u2013The Challenge of Cybersecurity and CBDCs,\\u201d analyzes the novel cybersecurity risks CBDCs may present for financial systems and makes the case that policymakers have ample options to safely introduce CBDCs. There are many design variants for CBDCs, ranging from centralized databases to distributed ledgers to token-based systems. Many of the proposed design variants for CBDCs (particularly retail CBDCs) involve the centralized collection of transaction data, posing major privacy and security risks.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: 4 key cybersecurity threats to new central bank digital currencies\\nURL: https://www.weforum.org/stories/2021/11/4-key-threats-central-bank-digital-currencies/\\nCONTENT: 4 key cyber security threats to the new central bank digital currencies | World Economic Forum If a CBDC is based on blockchain technology, it might use a multi-signature (\\u201cmulti-sig\\u201d) wallet where at least two other trusted parties hold credentials to the same wallet (this could be the central bank itself and/or family members or other contacts of the end users). If the CBDC operates on blockchain technology, where nodes include non-central bank entities that have powers to validate or invalidate transactions, malicious validator nodes can pose security threats. Failure to implement a robust cyber security strategy and consider the risks introduced above could compromise citizen data and funds, the success of the CBDC programme, central bank reputational risk and broader opinions of the new currency.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Security Considerations for a Central Bank Digital Currency\\nURL: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/security-considerations-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency-20220203.html\\nCONTENT: Therefore, many of the protections for existing payment systems may be applied to CBDCs. These protections are built upon select security and operational frameworks that guide system operators through risk assessments and the subsequent implementation of security controls based on the sensitivity of the data stored on the information system. The shared ownership and distributed character of a DLT-based CBDC mean that system responsibilities would not fall to one particular operator, and therefore, the implementation of security practices derived from frameworks like those highlighted in this note may benefit from institutional and end-user coordination, as well as the use of shared standards.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: PDF\\nURL: https://www.bis.org/publ/othp70.pdf\\nCONTENT: 2.

A key advantage of DLT-based CBDCs, noted by financial institutions and central banks, is the potential to help better manage existing risks, including fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing. From a policy perspective, CBDCs can complement (rather than replace) physical cash and provide continued access to central bank-backed money, foster digital innovation and increase financial inclusion. As such, CBDCs present a historic opportunity for central banks to create a new form of public money to meet future payment needs in the digital economy with safety, integrity, efficiency and access as a focus.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: Attack versus defence: central bank digital currencies and ...\\nURL: https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/attack-versus-defence-central-bank-digital-currencies-and-cybersecurity-threats/\\nCONTENT: Attack versus defence: central bank digital currencies and cybersecurity threats - Global Government Forum Global Government Fintech\\u00a0\\u2013 the sister title of Global Government Forum \\u2013 convened a webinar titled \\u2018CBDCs and cybersecurity: resilience considerations and digital money\\u2019 to hear three experts\\u2019 perspectives on a topic that BIS general manager Agust\\u00edn Carstens recently described as being of \\u201ccritical importance\\u201d and \\u201caddressing themes at the very heart of central banks\\u2019 mandates\\u201d.

These attributes enable CBDC to serve as effective tools for the calibration of national monetary policies, consequently improving the precision and efficacy of monetary policy transmission mechanisms (Lee et al., 2021) and ensuring stability within the macroeconomic framework. For instance, numerous scholars have explored the effects of CBDC on household budget constraints (Agur et al., 2022), output (Bindseil, 2019; Barrdear and Kumhof, 2022), payment systems (Bech et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2021), the banking system (Keister and Sanches, 2023; Kim and Kwon, 2023), monetary policy transmission (Lee et al., 2021), and financial system stability (Greenwood et al., 2016; Stevens, 2017; Bindseil, 2019).\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: The impact of CBDC on a deposit-dependent banking system\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572308924000688\\nCONTENT: The impact of CBDC on a deposit-dependent banking system - ScienceDirect The impact of CBDC on a deposit-dependent banking system\\u2606 We examine the implications of a CBDC introduction for highly deposit-dependent banks.

While many CBDC projects explore distributed ledger technologies, some central banks are implementing more traditional, centralized database architectures for their digital currencies: The choice of technologies for a CBDC system depends on various factors, including the specific goals of the central bank, the existing financial infrastructure, regulatory requirements, and the target use cases.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: CBDC explained: How It Works, Types, and Examples\\nURL: https://www.supermoney.com/encyclopedia/cbdc\\nCONTENT: These digital forms of fiat currency, issued by central banks, offer a new method of facilitating transactions, improving financial inclusion, and potentially transforming global financial systems. Central banks are exploring CBDCs as a way to streamline their monetary systems, reduce transaction costs, and promote financial inclusion. In countries like Nigeria, where CBDCs have already been implemented, the goal is to provide individuals who lack access to traditional banking with a secure and stable way to conduct digital transactions. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are poised to revolutionize the global financial system by offering a secure, efficient, and inclusive form of digital currency. Unlike fiat currency, CBDCs are designed to function entirely in digital form, offering enhanced security, faster transaction times, and lower costs, especially for cross-border payments.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Wholesale CBDC: Tokenized Financial System | G+D Spotlight\\nURL: https://www.gi-de.com/en/spotlight/currency-technology/wholesale-cbdc-key-to-future-tokenized-finance\\nCONTENT: G+D's integrated interface showcases a range of wholesale CBDC settlement use cases, demonstrating its potential in real-world applications.

It suggests policy options, including careful CBDC design, to mitigate these risks and balance the benefits with financial stability.\\nThe IMF Working Paper authored by Romain Bouis, Gaston Gelos, Paavo Miettinen, Fumitaka Nakamura, Erlend Nier, and Gabriel Soderberg, from the International Monetary Fund\\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets department, examines the implications of retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on financial stability. This detailed study looks at how the issuance of a CBDC to the general public could impact the balance sheets of both central banks and commercial banks, with a particular focus on the risks and opportunities this transition might present. The authors highlight that the financial stability effects of CBDCs depend on several key factors, including the size of the issuance, the initial conditions of the financial system, and how both banks and central banks react. Through scenario analysis, the paper explores how balance sheets might change in different environments, whether under normal conditions or during crises, and the potential impacts on financial stability.\\nRisks to Financial Intermediation\\nOne of the central concerns raised in the paper is that the issuance of CBDCs could lead to disruptions in the traditional banking system, particularly in terms of financial intermediation. The scenarios outlined in the study suggest that if CBDCs replace a significant portion of commercial bank deposits, the banking system could face challenges in maintaining stable and low-cost funding. This is particularly true when commercial banks do not have excess reserves to absorb the demand for CBDCs, forcing central banks to expand their balance sheets by providing more reserves. In such cases, banks may need to rely on more costly or volatile wholesale funding, which could lead to higher lending costs and reduce the overall availability of credit to businesses and consumers. Additionally, during periods of financial stress, there is a risk of \\\"digital bank runs,\\\" where depositors rapidly move their funds from traditional banks into CBDCs, exacerbating liquidity crises.\\nImpact on Bank Profitability and Lending\\nThe paper also discusses the potential consequences of CBDC adoption on banks' profitability. As banks lose cheaper deposit funding and are forced to replace it with more expensive central bank or wholesale funding, their profitability could decline. This, in turn, could lead to increased risk-taking as banks try to maintain profit margins, or it could prompt a reduction in lending to the private sector, which would have negative implications for economic growth. The authors argue that these risks are particularly pronounced when CBDC adoption is rapid or occurs during a financial crisis, as banks may struggle to adjust to the new environment in which deposits are being diverted into digital currencies.\\nMacroprudential Policies and Central Bank Lending\\nIn exploring potential policy responses to these challenges, the paper suggests several options that central banks and regulators might consider. One possibility is to adjust macroprudential policies to account for the new risks introduced by CBDCs, such as tightening capital and liquidity requirements for banks. However, the authors note that macroprudential policies alone are unlikely to be sufficient to fully mitigate the risks associated with CBDC issuance. Another potential solution is to expand central bank lending to the commercial banking system, particularly during times of stress. By providing additional liquidity through mechanisms such as longer-term refinancing operations, central banks could help ensure that banks have the necessary funding to continue lending, even if they face significant deposit outflows due to CBDC adoption.\\nDesigning CBDCs to Mitigate Risks\\nNevertheless, the most promising approach, according to the study, is to carefully design CBDCs in a way that limits their potential to disrupt the banking system. Specifically, the authors advocate for CBDC designs that encourage their use as a means of payment rather than as a store of value. This could be achieved through features such as imposing limits on the amount of CBDC individuals can hold or offering zero or negative interest rates on CBDC balances. These design choices would help prevent large-scale shifts of deposits from commercial banks into CBDCs, thereby reducing the risk of financial instability. Moreover, ensuring interoperability between CBDCs and traditional bank-operated payment systems could further mitigate these risks by allowing for a smoother integration of CBDCs into the existing financial system.\\nBalancing Benefits with Financial Stability\\nThe paper concludes by emphasizing that while CBDCs offer several potential benefits such as reducing the costs of producing and handling cash, improving financial inclusion, and enhancing the efficiency of payment systems these benefits must be weighed against the potential risks to financial stability. The authors argue that without careful consideration of these risks, CBDCs could lead to significant disruptions in the banking system, particularly if they are widely adopted in a short period of time or during times of economic stress. Therefore, central banks must carefully design CBDCs and consider a range of policy tools to ensure that their introduction does not inadvertently harm the broader financial system.\\n TRENDING \\n OPINION / BLOG / INTERVIEW \\n DevShots \\n Latest News \\n\\n\\r\\n                    Controversy Over Early Leave for Ramzan Sparks Political Debate in Telangana\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                    Delhi Sessions Court Stays Magistrate Order Over FIR Against Police in 2020 Riots Case\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                    Honda Achieves 2-Crore Milestone in Southern India\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                    City's Markets to Shine: Night Sweeping Initiative Launched\\r\\n                \\n\\n Connect us on \\n Email: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15 \\n\\u00a9 Copyright 2025\\n\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.analyticsinsight.net/banking/impact-of-digital-currencies-on-traditional-banking-systems\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nImpact of Digital Currencies on Traditional Banking Systems\\n\\nAbout Us\\nTrending\\nMagazines\\nPodcast\\nContact Us\\nAdvertise with Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInsights\\n\\n\\nCryptocurrencies\\n\\n\\nGadgets\\n\\n\\nStocks\\n\\nReports\\n\\nIndustry\\n\\n\\nGeography\\n\\n\\nNews\\n\\n\\nMore\\n\\n\\n\\u0939\\u093f\\u0928\\u094d\\u200d\\u0926\\u0940\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInsights\\n\\n\\nCryptocurrencies\\n\\n\\nGadgets\\n\\n\\nStocks\\n\\nReports\\n\\nIndustry\\n\\n\\nGeography\\n\\n\\nNews\\n\\n\\nMore\\n\\n\\n\\u0939\\u093f\\u0928\\u094d\\u200d\\u0926\\u0940\\n\\n\\nBanking\\nImpact of Digital Currencies on Traditional Banking Systems\\nHow Digital Currencies Are Transforming Traditional Banking Systems and Shaping the Future of Finance\\n\\nIndustryTrends\\nPublished on:\\u00a0\\n27 Nov 2024, 7:06 am\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopied\\n\\nDigital currencies, or virtual currencies, are changing the financial landscape fundamentally. These currencies work without central banks and governments using cryptography as a security means. They are alternatives to conventional banking systems. Bitcoin is the first currency of this kind, and since then, many others have been developed, such as Ethereum and Ripple.\\nThis increasing demand for digital currency traces back to a constantly rising need for decentralized systems, hence enabling efficient transactions with fewer intermediaries. These systems thus save cost while efficiently facilitating the process of transaction. As digital currency becomes popular, it is going to affect traditional banking.\\nIn this context, financial institutions are threatened with potential disruptions in their established business model and hence require a re-evaluation of strategy to integrate digital currency into their services. In this scenario, the transition would also have a change in consumer behavior as user behavior changes for ease and security in a transaction of digital currency.  \\nThis paper addresses the impact of digital currencies on traditional banking, looking at the challenges and opportunities ahead, and the ever-changing regulatory landscape. By studying these factors, a better understanding of the future of banking in the era of digital currencies will be developed.\\nWhat is a digital currency?\\nDigital currency is a medium of exchange that only comes in electronic form and is widely known as digital money, electronic money, electronic currency, or cybercash. In contrast with traditional currency, digital currencies do not have a physical counterpart and therefore cannot be physically handled or stored. They allow consumers and businesses to conduct transactions and trade in a virtual environment.\\nTypes of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currency is a broad term encompassing various forms of currency that exist solely in the electronic domain. Generally, digital currencies can be categorized into three main types:\\nCryptocurrencies\\nCryptocurrencies are digital currencies that deploy the use of cryptography not only to secure and confirm transactions in a network but also to govern creation. Notable examples comprise Bitcoin and Ethereum. The use of cryptocurrencies is regulated at a country-by-country and often viewed as virtual, as they live purely in the digital environment.\\nVirtual Currencies\\nVirtual currencies are unregulated digital currencies managed by developers or a founding organization composed of various stakeholders. They may also be governed by a specific network protocol. An example of a virtual currency is a gaming network token, whose economic framework is determined by its developers.\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\\nA central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a regulated digital currency issued by a country's central bank. In contrast to the traditional fiat currencies having physical and digital forms, the CBDC is purely digital. It is government-backed and seeks to make payments more efficient, reduces risks associated with cash handling, and promotes financial inclusion.\\nAdvantages of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currencies provide several significant benefits:\\nFast Transfers: The transactions are efficient and often free, happening directly between parties with no necessary intermediaries, unlike traditional banking systems.\\nNo Physical Manufacturing: They eliminate the need for the production of physical currency, which would otherwise be defective and contaminated.\\nMonetary Policy Implementation: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) allow governments to distribute payments directly to citizens, simplifying monetary processes without physical currency logistics.\\nLower Transaction Costs: Digital currencies enable direct payments within networks, reducing costs compared to physical currencies by cutting out middlemen.\\nDecentralization: Many digital currencies operate without government or financial institution control, enhancing resistance to censorship and manipulation.\\nPrivacy: Transactions are not tied to personal data, providing users with anonymity and confidentiality.\\nGlobal Accessibility: Anyone with internet access can use digital currencies, making them especially valuable in regions lacking traditional banking services.\\nDisadvantages of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currencies come with several notable drawbacks:\\nStorage and Infrastructure Issues: Although physical wallets are not required, digital currencies necessitate reliable internet access, smartphones, and secure online wallets for storage and processing.\\nHacking Vulnerability: The digital nature of these currencies makes them targets for hacking. Instances of stolen currencies from online wallets highlight the ongoing challenges of securing digital assets.\\nPrice Volatility: Digital currencies can experience significant price fluctuations, driven by market speculation and investor sentiment. This volatility can complicate their use as stable forms of currency.\\nLimited Acceptance: Many retailers and businesses do not yet accept digital currencies, making it difficult to use them for everyday transactions despite their growing popularity.\\nIrreversibility: Transactions made with digital currencies are final and cannot be reversed. This can pose challenges in cases of errors or fraud, particularly for newcomers who may lack familiarity with the technology.\\nEvolution of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currencies have evolved significantly since their inception, beginning with early concepts in the 1980s. David Chaum introduced\\u00a0eCash\\u00a0in 1983, a precursor to modern cryptocurrencies, which allowed for anonymous transactions. The late 1990s saw attempts like\\u00a0B-money\\u00a0and\\u00a0Bit Gold, but these did not achieve widespread success.\\nThe true breakthrough came in 2009 with the launch of\\u00a0Bitcoin\\u00a0by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who introduced blockchain technology, enabling secure, decentralized transactions without intermediaries. This innovation spurred the creation of thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), each aiming to improve upon Bitcoin's framework.\\nBy 2023, digital currencies had gained mainstream attention, with various countries exploring regulatory frameworks and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to integrate these innovations into traditional financial systems, marking a significant shift in the landscape of global finance.\\nWhat are Traditional Banking Systems?\\nTraditional banking systems are physical finance facility that accepts, deposits, provides loans, and facilitates payments and investments. The government authorities regulated the banking system which was operated through branches and ATMs, thereby being stable and protecting consumers as well as significant to the economy while facilitating various financial transactions.\\nAdvantages of Traditional Banking\\nIn-Person Visits: Traditional banks cater to customers who are skeptical about transacting through the internet. Customers can go to these banks within official working hours for several financial services like depositing cash, withdrawing, international transfers, and opening new accounts. There are also safe deposit boxes offered for customers to store valuable things and face-to-face contact that protects against fraud and identity theft.\\nFinancial Security: Traditional banking ensures security whereby money is safe and insured in case of any bank-related problems. There is a minimal threat of hackers or impersonators to account information if the customers are careful.\\nAccess to Loans: Traditional banks, having been around for ages in lending, have strict rules in place regarding interest rates and repayment terms. This is a sure guarantee that customers get the fairest of deals, unlike the predatory digital loan platforms that prey on borrowers with outrageous interest rates.\\nDisadvantages of Traditional Banking\\nCost of Transactions: Traditional banks impose fees for a range of services, from ATM maintenance to balance inquiries. These fees can accumulate over time, particularly if account holders do not maintain minimum balances or frequently transfer funds to other banks.\\nComplexity in Handling Customer Complaints: Although traditional banks offer face-to-face customer service, the complaint-resolution process might take a long time compared to an online bank. This is because the resolution often involves paperwork and bureaucratic procedures, which takes time.\\nAvailability: Traditional banks have special office hours that limit a customer's duration of accessing banking services. In case, the customer runs into problems outside office hours, he or she has either to refer the problem to online representatives or wait till the next business day.\\nStructure of Traditional Banking\\nThe structure of traditional banking consists of various components that work together to provide financial services. Key elements include:\\nHeadquarters: The central office where top management and corporate functions are located, overseeing the entire banking operations.\\nBranches: Physical locations where customers can access banking services, including opening accounts, depositing funds, and applying for loans. Branches are strategically placed to serve local communities.\\nATMs: Automated Teller Machines allow customers to perform basic banking transactions, such as withdrawals, deposits, and bala[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.bis.org/publ/work880.htm\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nRise of the central bank digital currencies: drivers, approaches and technologies\\n\\n\\nRise of the central bank digital currencies: drivers, approaches and technologies\\nBIS Working Papers \\u00a0|\\u00a0 No 880 \\u00a0|\\u00a0\\n24 August 2020\\nby\\u00a0Raphael Auer,\\u00a0Giulio Cornelli\\u00a0and\\u00a0Jon Frost\\nPDF full text (6,040kb)\\u00a0|\\u00a0 44 pages\\n\\nUpdate \\u2013\\u00a0March 2024\\nUpdated dataset\\u00a0on CBDC projects around the world.\\nThere are four live retail CBDCs in the world \\u2013 in The Bahamas, the Eastern Caribbean, Nigeria and Jamaica.

But the reasons for issuing them vary between countries, as do the policy approaches and technical designs. This paper looks at the economic and institutional motives behind current CBDC projects and asks how they might shape the design of such currencies.\\nContribution\\nWe draw up a database of research and development work, technical approaches and policy stances for the issuance of CBDCs. We assess the policy stance based on a database of more than 16,000 central bank speeches. We also take stock of actual development efforts, providing a taxonomy of technical designs from all relevant policy and analytical publications published by central banks worldwide. Next we look at the drivers of CBDC projects by relating development intensity to the economic and institutional differences between countries. Based on public reports and interviews with central bank experts, we set out the policy approaches behind three CBDC projects: China's Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DC/EP), Sweden's e-krona and the Bank of Canada's CBDC contingency plan.\\nFindings\\nOn the drivers for CBDC development, we find that most projects originate in digitised and innovative economies. Retail CBDC work is more advanced where the informal economy is larger. None of the projects surveyed seeks to replace cash - all aim to offer a digital complement.\\nOn the technical designs, we find that more and more central banks are considering \\\"Hybrid\\\" or \\\"Intermediated\\\" architectures, where the CBDC is a cash-like direct claim on the central bank but the private sector manages all customer-facing activity. Only a few jurisdictions are considering \\\"Direct\\\" designs, in which the central bank takes on some or all of the customer-facing side of payments. At present, no central bank reports that it is pursuing a \\\"Synthetic\\\" or \\\"Indirect\\\" CBDC design.\\nWhile central banks are considering various technical infrastructures, current proofs-of-concept tend to be based on distributed ledger technology rather than a conventional infrastructure. Access frameworks tend to be based on account identification rather than allowing for token-based anonymity. Most retail CBDC projects have a domestic focus.\\nAbstract\\nCentral bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are receiving more attention than ever before. Yet the motivations for issuance vary across countries, as do the policy approaches and technical designs. We investigate the economic and institutional drivers of CBDC development and take stock of design efforts. We set out a comprehensive database of technical approaches and policy stances on issuance, relying on central bank speeches and technical reports. Most projects are found in digitised economies with a high capacity for innovation. Work on retail CBDCs is more advanced where the informal economy is larger. We next take stock of the technical design options. More and more central banks are considering retail CBDC architectures in which the CBDC is a direct cash-like claim on the central bank, but where the private sector handles all customer-facing activity. We conclude with an in-depth description of three distinct CBDC approaches by the central banks of China, Sweden and Canada.\\nOnline annex\\u00a0(pdf)\\nUpdated datasets on central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects, speeches and search interest\\n\\nas of March 2024\\nas of July 2023\\nas of 13 January 2023\\nas of 1 July 2022\\nas of\\u00a01 January 2022\\nas of 1 October 2021\\nas of 1 July 2021\\nas of\\u00a05 April 2021\\nas of\\u00a01 December 2020\\n\\nOriginal dataset\\n\\nas of\\u00a024 August 2020\\n\\nJEL classification: E58, G21\\nKeywords: central bank digital currency, CBDC, central banking, digital currency, digital money, distributed ledger technology, blockchain\\nAbout the authors\\n Raphael Auer More from this author Giulio Cornelli More from this author\\n Jon Frost More from this author\\nTop\\n\\nShare this page\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStay connected\\n\\nFollow us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSign up to receive email alerts\\n\\n\\nAbout BIS\\n\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\nFAQ\\nContact\\nCareers\\n\\nTranslations\\n\\n\\nLegal information\\n\\n\\nTerms and conditions\\n\\nCopyright and permissions\\nPrivacy notice\\nCookies notice\\nEmail scam warning\\n\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://knowledge-archive.ghost.io/cbdc-impact-on-the-banking-system-disruptions-and-transformations-in-traditional-finance/\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nCBDC Impact on the Banking System: Disruptions and Transformations in Traditional Finance\\n\\nsystrader79\\n\\n\\n\\nCBDC Impact on the Banking System: Disruptions and Transformations in Traditional Finance\\n\\nThe advent of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represents a paradigm shift in the landscape of monetary systems, potentially triggering profound disruptions and transformations within traditional financial frameworks, particularly the banking sector.  CBDCs, as digital forms of sovereign currency issued and backed by a nation's central bank, stand in contrast to commercial bank money and private cryptocurrencies.  This distinction is crucial as it positions CBDCs as a direct liability of the central bank, imbued with the full faith and credit of the government, a characteristic that fundamentally alters the risk profile and operational dynamics of money within an economy.\\n\\nThe exploration of CBDCs by central banks worldwide is not merely a technological upgrade of existing payment systems but rather a strategic response to a confluence of factors, including the declining use of cash, the proliferation of private digital currencies, and the imperative to enhance payment system efficiency, financial inclusion, and monetary policy effectiveness.  According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) 2023 annual economic report, \\\"93% of central banks are exploring CBDCs, with more than half now in advanced stages of development, experimentation, or pilot.\\\"  This widespread interest underscores the transformative potential of CBDCs and the necessity to rigorously analyze their implications for the banking system.\\n\\nDisintermediation Risks and the Shifting Landscape of Bank Deposits\\n\\nOne of the most significant potential disruptions posed by CBDCs to the traditional banking system is the risk of disintermediation.  This risk stems from the possibility that households and businesses might choose to hold a substantial portion of their funds in CBDC accounts directly with the central bank, rather than in commercial bank deposits.  A study by Kumhof and Noone (2021) at the Bank of England estimated that in a scenario where CBDC holdings reach 30% of GDP, commercial bank deposits could decline by approximately 22%, leading to a contraction in bank lending and a restructuring of the banking sector.  This potential shift in deposit behavior is driven by several factors inherent to CBDCs.\\n\\nFirstly, CBDCs offer a risk-free alternative to commercial bank deposits, as they are a direct liability of the central bank, eliminating credit risk and minimizing liquidity risk.  In times of financial stress or uncertainty, depositors might be incentivized to move their funds from commercial banks to the safety of CBDC accounts, triggering deposit flight and exacerbating systemic instability.  A 2022 IMF working paper on CBDCs noted that \\\"in stress scenarios, CBDCs could accelerate bank runs, as depositors may rapidly switch to CBDC, perceived as safer than commercial bank deposits.\\\"  This heightened sensitivity to risk could necessitate significant adjustments in bank funding models and liquidity management strategies.\\n\\nSecondly, CBDCs could potentially offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts, especially in environments where central banks aim to manage inflation or stimulate economic activity.  If CBDCs are designed to be interest-bearing, they could become a more attractive savings vehicle for consumers, further diverting funds away from commercial banks.  However, the design of CBDC interest rates is a complex issue, with central banks needing to carefully balance the attractiveness of CBDCs against the potential for excessive disintermediation.  The European Central Bank (ECB) in its ongoing exploration of a digital euro is carefully considering the interest rate policy for the digital euro to mitigate adverse impacts on bank intermediation.\\n\\nFurthermore, the ease of access and use of CBDCs, facilitated by digital wallets and potentially lower transaction costs, could make them a preferred medium of exchange for everyday transactions.  This could reduce the demand for transactional balances in commercial bank accounts, further impacting bank deposit volumes.  A survey conducted by the Federal Reserve in 2023 found that \\\"58% of adults in the US use mobile payments, indicating a growing preference for digital payment methods,\\\" which could accelerate the adoption of CBDCs for transactional purposes if they offer superior convenience and cost-effectiveness.  This shift in transactional behavior could necessitate banks to re-evaluate their fee structures and service offerings to remain competitive in the payments landscape.\\n\\nThe implications of deposit disintermediation for banks are multifaceted.  A reduction in deposit funding would necessitate banks to rely more heavily on wholesale funding markets, which are typically more volatile and expensive than retail deposits.  This could increase banks' funding costs and potentially reduce their profitability.  Research by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the Markets Committee (MC) of the BIS in 2018 highlighted that \\\"increased reliance on wholesale funding can amplify liquidity risks for banks, especially during periods of market stress.\\\"  Moreover, a contraction in bank deposits could limit banks' capacity to extend credit, potentially dampening economic growth and necessitating adjustments in monetary policy implementation.\\n\\nTransformations in Monetary Policy Implementation and Effectiveness\\n\\nCBDCs have the potential to significantly transform the implementation and effectiveness of monetary policy.  Traditional monetary policy operates through indirect channels, influencing interest rates and credit conditions through interventions in the interbank market and adjustments to reserve requirements.  CBDCs, however, offer the prospect of a more direct and granular transmission mechanism, enabling central banks to exert more precise control over monetary conditions and potentially enhance the effectiveness of policy interventions.\\n\\nOne key advantage of CBDCs in monetary policy implementation is the potential for direct monetary transfers to households and businesses.  In times of economic downturn or crisis, central banks could distribute CBDCs directly to citizens' digital wallets, bypassing the traditional banking system and ensuring that stimulus measures reach the intended recipients quickly and efficiently.  This \\\"helicopter money\\\" approach, often discussed in theoretical monetary policy literature, becomes practically feasible with CBDCs, offering a powerful tool for counter-cyclical policy.  A 2020 paper by Gal\\u00ed argues that \\\"CBDC-based direct transfers could be a more effective and equitable way to deliver fiscal stimulus compared to traditional methods, especially during crises when banking channels may be impaired.\\\"\\n\\nFurthermore, CBDCs could facilitate the implementation of negative interest rates more effectively.  In a traditional cash-based system, negative interest rates are constrained by the zero lower bound, as individuals can always choose to hold physical cash at a zero nominal return.  However, with CBDCs, central banks could potentially impose negative interest rates on CBDC holdings, making it costly to hoard digital cash and thereby stimulating spending and investment during periods of deflationary pressure or low economic growth.  A 2016 IMF staff discussion note explored the feasibility of negative interest rates and concluded that \\\"CBDCs could remove the effective lower bound on interest rates, providing central banks with more policy space to combat deflation.\\\"  However, the implementation of negative interest rates on CBDCs raises complex legal, social, and political considerations that need to be carefully addressed.\\n\\nCBDCs could also enhance the granular data availability for central banks, providing real-time insights into payment flows, economic activity, and financial behavior.  The digital nature of CBDCs allows for the collection of detailed transaction data, while ensuring privacy through appropriate safeguards.  This enhanced data transparency could improve central banks' ability to monitor economic conditions, detect emerging risks, and fine-tune monetary policy responses.  The BIS Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) in a 2021 report emphasized that \\\"CBDCs could provide central banks with a richer and more timely dataset for macroeconomic analysis and policy formulation, improving the effectiveness of monetary policy and financial stability monitoring.\\\"  However, the use of CBDC transaction data raises important privacy concerns that require robust legal and technological frameworks to protect user confidentiality.\\n\\nDespite the potential benefits, the introduction of CBDCs also presents challenges for monetary policy implementation.  The potential for large-scale shifts from commercial bank deposits to CBDCs could complicate the management of bank reserves and liquidity.  Central banks would need to develop new operational frameworks to manage the supply of CBDCs and ensure the smooth functioning of the payment system and money markets.  A 2022 study by Bindseil et al. at the ECB highlighted the need for \\\"careful calibration of CBDC design and implementation to avoid unintended consequences for monetary policy operations and financial stability.\\\"  Furthermore, the international implications of CBDCs, particularly in cross-border payments and currency substitution, require international cooperation and coordination to ensure global monetary and financial stability.\\n\\nEnhancements in Payment Systems and Efficiency\\n\\nCBDCs have the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness of payment systems, both domestically and internationally.  Traditional payment systems often involve multiple intermediaries, leading to delays, higher transaction costs, and l[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389239045_Disruptive_Impacts_of_Central_Bank_Digital_Currencies_on_the_Traditional_Financial_System_A_Regulatory_Framework_Perspective: HTTP 403: Forbidden\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0275531923001198: HTTP 403: Forbidden\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1042443123001324: HTTP 403: Forbidden\\n\""

This detailed study looks at how the issuance of a CBDC to the general public could impact the balance sheets of both central banks and commercial banks, with a particular focus on the risks and opportunities this transition might present. The authors highlight that the financial stability effects of CBDCs depend on several key factors, including the size of the issuance, the initial conditions of the financial system, and how both banks and central banks react. Through scenario analysis, the paper explores how balance sheets might change in different environments, whether under normal conditions or during crises, and the potential impacts on financial stability.\\nOne of the central concerns raised in the paper is that the issuance of CBDCs could lead to disruptions in the traditional banking system, particularly in terms of financial intermediation. The scenarios outlined in the study suggest that if CBDCs replace a significant portion of commercial bank deposits, the banking system could face challenges in maintaining stable and low-cost funding. This is particularly true when commercial banks do not have excess reserves to absorb the demand for CBDCs, forcing central banks to expand their balance sheets by providing more reserves. In such cases, banks may need to rely on more costly or volatile wholesale funding, which could lead to higher lending costs and reduce the overall availability of credit to businesses and consumers. Additionally, during periods of financial stress, there is a risk of \\\"digital bank runs,\\\" where depositors rapidly move their funds from traditional banks into CBDCs, exacerbating liquidity crises.\\nThe paper also discusses the potential consequences of CBDC adoption on banks' profitability. As banks lose cheaper deposit funding and are forced to replace it with more expensive central bank or wholesale funding, their profitability could decline. This, in turn, could lead to increased risk-taking as banks try to maintain profit margins, or it could prompt a reduction in lending to the private sector, which would have negative implications for economic growth. The authors argue that these risks are particularly pronounced when CBDC adoption is rapid or occurs during a financial crisis, as banks may struggle to adjust to the new environment in which deposits are being diverted into digital currencies.\\nIn exploring potential policy responses to these challenges, the paper suggests several options that central banks and regulators might consider. One possibility is to adjust macroprudential policies to account for the new risks introduced by CBDCs, such as tightening capital and liquidity requirements for banks. However, the authors note that macroprudential policies alone are unlikely to be sufficient to fully mitigate the risks associated with CBDC issuance. Another potential solution is to expand central bank lending to the commercial banking system, particularly during times of stress. By providing additional liquidity through mechanisms such as longer-term refinancing operations, central banks could help ensure that banks have the necessary funding to continue lending, even if they face significant deposit outflows due to CBDC adoption.\\nNevertheless, the most promising approach, according to the study, is to carefully design CBDCs in a way that limits their potential to disrupt the banking system. Specifically, the authors advocate for CBDC designs that encourage their use as a means of payment rather than as a store of value. This could be achieved through features such as imposing limits on the amount of CBDC individuals can hold or offering zero or negative interest rates on CBDC balances. These design choices would help prevent large-scale shifts of deposits from commercial banks into CBDCs, thereby reducing the risk of financial instability. Moreover, ensuring interoperability between CBDCs and traditional bank-operated payment systems could further mitigate these risks by allowing for a smoother integration of CBDCs into the existing financial system.\\nThe paper concludes by emphasizing that while CBDCs offer several potential benefits such as reducing the costs of producing and handling cash, improving financial inclusion, and enhancing the efficiency of payment systems these benefits must be weighed against the potential risks to financial stability. The authors argue that without careful consideration of these risks, CBDCs could lead to significant disruptions in the banking system, particularly if they are widely adopted in a short period of time or during times of economic stress. Therefore, central banks must carefully design CBDCs and consider a range of policy tools to ensure that their introduction does not inadvertently harm the broader financial system.\\n\""

Introduction and general overview Since 2020, a group of central banks, together with the Bank for International Settlements, have been exploring selected aspects of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).1 As part of this joint work, the group shares insights and perspectives gained from the central banks\\u2019 individual analysis and experiments on a range of CBDC-themes, including those more broadly related to payments modernization.2 This report summarises the group\\u2019s discussion on several topics in relation to the system design of retail (also called general-purpose) CBDC arrangements.3 These may likely become relevant should a central bank consider developing a retail CBDC arrangement. The report first provides some perspectives on overall system design and then focuses on four key issues essential for designing a well-functioning retail CBDC system: privacy, cyber security (including quantum computing), offline functionality4 and point of sale considerations. These issues are multi-dimensional and often interconnected. Technical experimentation frequently highlights complementary policy choices that a jurisdiction may need to determine when it is designing or modernizing a payments system. Jurisdictions each have their own existing policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks, as well as their own policy objectives. For a given jurisdiction, addressing legal and public policy requirements as well as interactions and interconnectedness both within and beyond the system may be essential to ensure a coherent system design. The work of the group over the last 18 months has discussed those areas alongside technical capabilities to better understand the associated trade-offs, without drawing specific policy conclusions. Despite progress to better understand the practicalities around these issues, challenges and open questions remain. In addition, for the purpose of developing a well-functioning retail CBDC system, there are other issues which should be addressed. The main takeaways are: \\u2022 In a two-tier CBDC system centralised versus decentralised options may not have to be two mutually exclusive and incompatible design choices. A jurisdiction\\u2019s optimal architecture may consist of many different modular components, each supporting a specific set of requirements. \\u2022 Privacy may be a key consideration for central banks when designing a CBDC system and involves navigating numerous trade-offs. Privacy enhancing techniques (PETs) may provide both opportunities and challenges within a retail 1 Participating central banks are: the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank. Since publishing a report in October 2020 setting out the common foundational principles and core features of a CBDC, and an executive summary and three detailed reports on system design and interoperability, user needs and adoption and financial stability implications in September 2021, the group has continued to share ideas and perspectives on similar themes published in 2023. 2 While sharing lessons learned and finding commonalities, the group is not conducting joint experimentation. 3 The discussions focus on a two-tiered model for retail CBDC. 4 Offline functionality is being explored as a potential feature and it is not necessarily agreed that it would be desirable in every jurisdiction. Central bank digital currencies: system design 3 CBDC system and trade-offs should be examined when considering PETs versus more traditional methods to deliver privacy. The system should also be designed in a way to ensure that the implementation of privacy still allows for robust protection of end-users and issuers against fraud and forgery. \\u2022 PET may allow extraction of information from encrypted data without revealing personal information and would add an extra layer of protection and design flexibility. However, experimental work conducted by some of the central banks contributing to this report suggests that some of these PETs may not yet be feasible to use in real-time, are complicated, introduce additional latency and raise reliability concerns. However, the field is evolving, and more investigation might be required. \\u2022 Most security risks are not unique to CBDC. However, traditional risks may be amplified for CBDC because there may be greater incentives for malicious actors to attack the system. Existing cyber defence practices and frameworks may be applicable to CBDC, but the choice of a two-tier model, which may allow external parties to innovate in the ecosystem in jurisdictions that allow them to do so, can introduce new challenges. \\u2022 Quantum computers of the future may have the potential to challenge the integrity of the current (\\u2018classical\\u2019) cryptography methods, albeit over an uncertain period. A path to utilising post-quantum cryptography (PQC), or avoiding the vulnerabilities of classical cryptography, likely needs to be formulated. The question of quantum safety may also apply to conventional payment systems but, being greenfield, central banks, if issuing CBDC, may be well placed to adopt transition strategies to PQC and make relevant trade-offs proactively. \\u2022 Security may also be interconnected with the ability to deliver offline services ensuring funds cannot be double spent, minted outside the central bank, or compliance circumvented. There is cautious optimism that a practical solution for offline functionality may be found, though jurisdictions may choose to have additional controls such as holding limits in place to mitigate residual risks. \\u2022 Central banks may also consider how to use existing technology and standards in accordance with their strategies for adoption. For example, according to the proof-of-concept by a central bank, overall modern Point of Sale (PoS) terminals may be ubiquitous and flexible enough to accommodate CBDC, though there may likely still be several technical considerations. The report is organised as follows. Section 2 shares perspectives on the overall system design of retail CBDC platforms. Section 3 then discusses the system design considerations in more detail, focussing on privacy and privacy enhancing techniques, cyber security, offline CBDC and PoS considerations. Section 4 concludes. 2. Perspectives on the overall system design The central banks contributing to this report explored, as part of an earlier report, considerations for designing a potential retail CBDC, including an overview of functions in a broad ecosystem, the different roles in a private-public collaboration, 4 Central bank digital currencies: system design and how an interoperable CBDC system could be implemented.5 Central banks are focusing their exploration on the two-tier system (where some roles would be carried out by the public sector and other by private institutions), and within this system there are different architectural design options. As work has progressed and more experience has been gained, discussions around how the division of responsibility between central banks and intermediaries in a centralised versus decentralised model have matured.6 In particular, the group focused on the division of data ownership from the authority to update the data. For the purpose of this report, architectures may be categorized into two approaches: centralised and decentralised. In a centralised model, one entity owns the data and has authority over updates, ie to execute functions. In a decentralised model, data is spread across the system, regardless of controlling entities.7 Decentralised models may either take the form of (i) hub-and-spoke in which data is owned by multiple entities while authority over updates is in one entity's control; or (ii) peer-to-peer in which data ownership and authority over updates are both shared across multiple entities. Each model may bring opportunities and challenges. While a hub-and-spoke configuration has formed the basis of several proofs-of-concept and pilots for CBDC, it may present challenges of weak resilience if a data store is lost. It may also introduce critical dependencies on the infrastructure operated by a central authority which could result in a single point of failure and if improperly designed, bottlenecks to processing. However, designed suitably, decentralised architectures of this type may be more trustworthy from a privacy perspective by restricting consumers\\u2019 information to private entities outside the central bank\\u2019s visibility. On the other side, delegating authority as in a peer-to-peer configuration might not be suitable for the core settlement of a CBDC system. For example, jurisdictions likely believe that it is inappropriate to delegate authority in a manner that potentially introduces scenarios that runs counter to the central banks\\u2019 goals. However, the peer-to-peer model may theoretically be appropriate in scenarios where no single entity has end-to-end authority, such as cross-border transfers that span multiple jurisdictions.8 A more nuanced assessment of the system design in the context of CBDC may also be considered: centralised versus decentralised options may not have to be two mutually exclusive and incompatible design choices for building a CBDC platform. An optimal design may consist of many different, modular components, each supporting a specific set of requirements. For example, some components may likely 5 CBDC Group (2021) available at CBDC - System design and interoper[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4232502\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nEffects of Particle Size on the Pyrolysis of Spruce and Poplar: Thermogravimetric Analyses, Daem Modelling, Validation, and Prediction of Secondary Charring\\n\\n31 Pages\\nPosted: 28 Sep 2022\\n\\nYong TIAN\\n\\naffiliation not provided to SSRN\\n\\nPatrick PERRE\\n\\nCentraleSup\\u00e9lec\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nParticle size plays a crucial role in biomass pyrolysis mechanisms and their subsequent industrial uses. However, an applicable kinetic method that combines thermogravimetric data with distributed activation energy model (DAEM) adapted to the sample size is still missing. This work investigated pyrolysis kinetics of two wood species (spruce and poplar) with five particle shapes (powder, particle, 5-mm diameter cylinders with heights of 1 mm, 2 mm, and 4 mm) and one additional reaction condition (powder with lid). The experimental data were numerically simulated by two Gaussian + one exponential DAEM distributions. Thermogravimetric results evidenced a significant effect of particle geometry on char yields, which increased by 81% and 66%, from powder to 4-mm high cylinders, for spruce and poplar respectively. The increase in particle size and use of a crucible lid led to an increase of exothermic heat. Elemental analysis demonstrated a contradictory relation between carbonization and mass loss, which was explained by secondary charring. Synthetic indexes built from the kinetics parameters of the DAEM model clearly depicts the effect of particle sizes. The prediction ability of the model was checked by further experiments performed at different time-temperature patterns with several particle sizes. Finally, correlations between dimensionless residual mass (DRM) and element compositions allowed us to determine the composition of secondary charring, which consists mainly of carbon. The elemental composition of char can therefore be predicted using the difference of DAEM kinetics between fine powder and a given particle size.\\n\\n\\n\\nKeywords: biomass, elemental analysis, particle size, Pseudo-component, Wood.\\n\\nSuggested Citation:\\nSuggested Citation\\n\\nYong TIAN (Contact Author)\\n\\naffiliation not provided to SSRN  ( email )\\n\\nNo Address Available\\n\\nPatrick PERRE\\n\\nCentraleSup\\u00e9lec  ( email )\\n\\nDo you have a job opening that you would like to promote on SSRN?\\n\\nPaper statistics\\n\\nSSRN Quick Links\\n\\nSSRN Rankings\\n\\nAbout SSRN\\n\\nAll content on this site: Copyright \\u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc., its licensors, and contributors.

How Should Countries Explore CBDCs?\\nExploring CBDCs is a significant undertaking that involves complex decisions in a rapidly changing digital environment. This chapter presents a dynamic framework that is iterative, flexible, and responsive to new information as it arises. First, countries must clearly establish the policy objectives of CBDCs and relevant success measures. Second, risks must be identified, quantified as much as possible, and accompanied by a strategy to contain them. Third, domestic authorities should undertake a careful assessment of their capacity to experiment with, regulate, oversee, and eventually implement CBDCs. Fourth, communication about CBDCs is crucial and a strategy to guide engagement with stakeholders should be developed early on. Fifth, central banks should establish a set of feature requirements based on the earlier steps. Sixth, a sound legal basis and robust regulatory foundations should underpin the CBDC project from the start. These steps should not give the impression of a linear process. Given rapid developments in technology and the ongoing lessons that are\\u2014and will be\\u2014learned world-wide, CBDC exploration will need to continue even beyond the point of issuance.\\n\\nRead the Chapter\\n\\n\\n2. How Can Central Banks Manage CBDC Product Development?\\nThis chapter introduces the '5P methodology' designed to guide central banks in exploring and developing CBDC, from research to potential launch. The methodology draws from experiences in various jurisdictions and incorporates best practices from different industries, and is intended to facilitate experimentation and support progressive decision-making while effectively managing risks. The 5P methodology comprises five distinct phases. The preparation phase focuses on researching trends, defining objectives, establishing success criteria, evaluating feasibility, assessing capacity, and analyzing risks. The proof-of-concept phase involves conducting small-scale empirical tests and validation activities to gain insights into CBDC designs, typically in a laboratory environment. The prototype phase concentrates on the development or acquisition of necessary technologies and the selection of relevant partners. The pilot phase represents the live testing of a quasi-final product, while the production phase marks the final issuance and operation of the CBDC.\\n\\nRead the Chapter\\n\\n\\n3. Will CBDCs Affect Monetary Policy Transmission?\\nCBDCs could affect the macroeconomic environment that underpins monetary policy transmission. A CBDC offers a safe store of value and efficient means of payment, which can increase competition for deposit funding, raise banks\\u2019 share of wholesale funding, and lower bank profits. A CBDC also could bolster financial inclusion and help reduce dollarization or cryptoization. These changes in the macroeconomic environment can potentially strengthen the channels of monetary policy transmission if CBDC is appropriately designed. For moderate levels of CBDC holdings, the effects on monetary policy transmission are expected to be relatively small in normal times. However, these effects can be more significant in an environment of low interest rates or financial market stress in which the relative value of a CBDC increases. A non-remunerated CBDC could harden the zero lower bound for interest rates. Finally, a CBDC could increase risks of flight to safety from retail bank deposits in periods of market stress.\\n\\nRead the Chapter\\n\\n\\n4. How Can Capital Flow Management Measures Be Implemented with CBDCs?\\nThis chapter explores the benefits, risks, and complexities of implementing capital flow management measures (CFMs) through CBDCs. It argues that CFMs, when warranted, can continue to be part of a country\\u2019s policy toolkit in the digital age. Moreover, the digitalization of information and programmability of transactions\\u2014leading to the automation of compliance checks\\u2014could bring efficiency gains compared to today\\u2019s implementation of CFMs, though raise operational risks. Importantly, the implementation of CFMs would leverage the programmability of CBDC transactions, not of CBDC itself, as money must remain fungible. Several questions need to be further analyzed, for instance the specification of the legal framework surrounding digital CFMs.\\n\\nRead the Chapter\\n\\n\\n5. Could a CBDC Help Promote Financial Inclusion?\\nFinancial inclusion is often a key policy objective for a retail CBDC, especially in emerging and lower-income countries. If properly designed to address barriers to financial inclusion, CBDCs could gain acceptance as a payment mechanism for financially excluded populations. CBDCs can be designed to replicate some of the desirable properties of cash, for instance, access to payments without a bank account, trust associated with central bank money, low or no fees, and less stringent identity requirements for low-risk populations who struggle to obtain formal identity documentation. However, full compliance with financial integrity requirements remains necessary. A CBDC could also offer benefits beyond those of cash, such as the development [TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/pdf/the-rise-of-central-bank-digital-currencies.pdf\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nThe Rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) What you need to know November 2019 What is a CBDC?\\nPrompted by technology advances and a decline in cash usage around the world, many central banks are exploring whether it would be possible to issue a CBDC complement to cash. A CBDC is a digital payment token which is issued and fully backed by a central bank and is legal tender.\\nBlockchain or Distributed-Ledger-Technology (DLT) is one technology that can facilitate a CBDC and it is a key feature that CBDCs share with other cryptoassets, such as Bitcoin. However, unlike decentralised cryptocurrencies which operate on a permissionless or public blockchain and where no one person, corporation or central bank has control over the network, it is expected that central banks will initially issue their CBDC on a permissioned or private blockchain network. This means that access and control to the blockchain is limited to a select group of approved participants, permitting the central bank to retain control of the overall money supply.\\nCBDCs are also \\u2018programmable money\\u2019, meaning that payment tokens or digital fiat can now have specific design features and attributes built into the token itself. Broadly speaking, the common policy debates contemplate two types of CBDCs, \\u2018wholesale central bank digital currencies\\u2019, which would facilitate more efficient central bank clearing operations between the central bank and its members banks, and \\u2018retail central bank digital currencies\\u2019 which would be available for use by the public at large and would effectively be the equivalent of a bank note, albeit in digital form. For example, the token could pay the token holder interest directly into their wallet and there are endless possibilities for the design of the tokens, as well as the overall network. Each central bank could design a currency according to their own monetary policy and economic objectives. What are the potential benefits of a CBDC?\\nThere are many potential benefits for the issuing central bank. Digital currency could provide a real-time picture of economic activity in a country or region as well as provide more accurate and timely economic data for GDP estimates than are available today. For citizens and businesses, transactions would be more efficient with near instantaneous settlement at potentially a fraction of the cost.\\nCBDCs can also help in the fight against corruption and money laundering, as authorities would be able to trace transactions far more effectively than is possible today. What are potential policy areas of interest?\\nDepending on how the system supporting a CBDC is designed, a new blockchain enabled CBDC may give rise to some complex questions which need to be considered. Many central banks are concerned, for example, that introducing a CBDC could potentially disintermediate the commercial banking sector. If citizens, particularly in times of economic stress, pull their savings from commercial banks and place them in risk-free accounts directly with the central bank, this may trigger a bank run and place intense stress on the commercial banking sector. This risk was discussed by the European Central Bank (ECB) in a recent policy paper1, noting that \\u201cby potentially providing an alternative to some types of bank deposit, CBDC could induce its holders to withdraw a substantial amount of liquidity from the banking system, thereby influencing its ability to finance economic activity in normal times\\u201d. It is for this reason that many central banks are unlikely to implement retail CBDCs as a first step or, in any event, do so without using existing financial intermediaries. Data privacy, and compliance with applicable consumer data protection and data privacy laws is another potential area of focus. If transactions are immutable, how will the \\u2018right to be forgotten\\u2019, which is a core tenet of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law in the European Union (EU), be addressed by affected central banks? Ironically, the ECB noted recently1 that traditional cash could continue to be a favoured transaction medium for those wishing to have anonymity or privacy.\\nThere has been renewed conversation and debate recently about Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Whilst central banks have been researching this topic for some time, recent media articles about certain central banks potentially issuing their own CBDC have brought this topic to the forefront of the related policy debate. Here are essential aspects of CBDCs that you need to know!\\nThe Rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Regulation around DLTs and digital assets can also be inconsistent and may vary widely across different jurisdictions. As regulators begin to formulate more mature approaches and react to new developments, there may be rapid changes to the regulatory landscape. Additionally, there is an inherent risk that the private keys which provide access to digital assets could be stolen by hackers. Security is paramount for the wallets which store the private keys that are necessary to transact (e.g., buy/sell/transfer) digital assets on the blockchain.\\nHow widespread is the exploration of CBDCs?\\nMany central banks have been researching this technology since 2013 and a recent Bank for International Settlement (BIS) study2 shows that seventy percent of central banks surveyed are engaged in some type of CBDC exploration3. In fact, the IMF published a paper in November 2017 encouraging central banks to experiment with CBDCs4. The First Deputy Governor of the Bank of France also stated at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) meeting in October 2019 that central banks should not refrain from experimenting with different forms of CBDC, with a higher potential from his perspective, for wholesale CBDCs5.\\nExamples of pilots abound, such as \\u2018Project Jasper\\u2019 where the Bank of Canada is conducting a collaborative research initiative between the public and private sectors to understand how DLT could transform the wholesale payments system6. In Singapore, \\u2018Project Ubin\\u2019 is a collaborative project with the banking sector, exploring the use of DLT for clearing and settlement of payments and securities, as well as new methods of conducting cross-border payments using CBDCs7. In February 2018, the Republic of the Marshall Islands issued the Sovereign Currency Act of 20188 which introduced a new blockchain based currency called the Sovereign (\\u2018SOV\\u2019). The recent announcement from Facebook launching the Libra Association was a major catalyst in bringing this topic to the top of the agenda of many policy makers around the world. These examples have also prompted many other central banks to look more closely at CBDCs. For example, the Bank of England\\u2019s Governor Mark Carney raised the idea of a Global Digital Currency, backed by numerous central banks at the annual Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers. What are the characteristics of China\\u2019s CBDC?\\nAt HK FinTech Week, Mr. Mu Changchun, Director-General of the Institute of Digital Currency of the People\\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC), announced details regarding the PBoC\\u2019s plans to release China\\u2019s version of a CBDC, the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) coin. Mr. Mu noted that the DCEP coin will be targeted specifically at the retail sector only, and not at institutional and wholesale payments. The PBoC plans to enable commercial banks and certain other institutions to distribute the DCEP coins to the general public. The PBoC does not plan on issuing DCEP coins to the public directly, rather allowing the existing financial ecosystem to bring the coins to the public. DCEP coins will be designed to be used as the equivalent of existing fiat currency (i.e. paper notes and coins). However, users will need to open a digital wallet to send, receive, and hold DCEP coins (this can be done without any linkage to a bank account). No interest will be paid for holding DCEP, and there also should be no implications for inflation and no impact on central bank monetary policy.\\nHow will businesses have to adapt?\\nBlockchain and cryptocurrencies are emerging technologies that are continuously evolving and being applied to new use cases. This subject matter is complex and technical, requiring sufficient expertise to navigate. Senior management should consider having a strategy in place which outlines the potential impact of CBDCs on their businesses and consider implementing a strategy in order to respond to the changing landscape. Management and digital asset teams will need to collectively build the appropriate competence and capabilities to perform business operations, as well as to understand and effectively manage the related risks.\\nOrganisations will potentially need new policies and procedures to govern how they will interact with and manage digital assets. Digital asset activities will impact not just policies and controls surrounding the new technology, but also resources and whether they are properly suited and have the right expertise to perform their jobs. Distributed ledger technology protocols may have different governance, organisational, or technological approaches, which may necessitate a redesign of traditional control frameworks.\\nBusinesses can consider whether to focus on in-house development or work with a third party for services related to digital assets. Similar to traditional business processes, there might be functions related to digital assets that would be more efficient if outsourced to a third party. The maturity of internal capabilities and the level of complexity in a business model will dictate whether third party service providers could be an effective solution.\\n4 Conclusion This announcement by the PBOC is a significant milestone in the history of money and China\\u2019s implementation of a CBDC could have a transformative effect on its economy, and on those beyond.

        "value": "The introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is anticipated to have profound implications for the traditional banking system and overall financial stability over the next five years. This updated analysis integrates new evidence and perspectives from recent papers and research, addressing previously noted shortcomings by providing specific data, examples, and empirical findings.\n\n### 1. **Transformation of the Banking Landscape**\nCBDCs, as digital forms of sovereign currency issued by central banks, pose a significant threat of disintermediation to traditional banks. They present a secure, government-backed alternative for deposits, which could incentivize consumers to move their funds from commercial banks to CBDC accounts, especially in times of financial uncertainty. For instance, research from the Bank of England suggests that if CBDCs represent 30% of GDP, commercial bank deposits could decline by up to 22%, which would markedly reduce banks' lending capabilities and lead to a systemic restructuring of the banking sector (source: Knowledge Archive).\n\nMoreover, the design of CBDCs is crucial. If structured as interest-bearing deposits, they could attract depositors away from banks, creating funding challenges for those reliant on lower-cost deposit funding (source: IMF Working Paper). The International Monetary Fund\u2019s studies also indicate that if CBDCs provide a more attractive proposition than commercial banking products, a significant shift could occur, causing traditional banks to face liquidity strains and higher costs associated with wholesale funding (source: IMF Working Paper).\n\n### 2. **Financial Stability Concerns**\nThe risk of \"digital bank runs,\" where depositors rapidly withdraw funds from traditional banks to switch to CBDCs during times of stress, poses serious risks to financial stability. The IMF has highlighted that rapid conversions to CBDCs could exacerbate liquidity crises, particularly during economic downturns (source: IMF Working Paper). Past incidents of bank runs, albeit in a non-digital context, underline the plausibility of similar behaviors in a CBDC scenario, emphasizing the need for robust liquidity management frameworks within banks (source: BIS).\n\nConversely, CBDCs can enhance financial stability by providing central banks with new tools to manage monetary policy directly. A study suggests that carefully designed CBDCs\u2014including measures that limit their potential to serve as a store of value, such as capping holding amounts or implementing zero or negative interest rates\u2014can help mitigate the risk of significant deposit withdrawal and maintain financial stability (source: Devdiscourse).\n\n### 3. **Monetary Policy Implications**\nCBDCs have the potential to transform monetary policy transmission. By allowing direct access to central bank money, they could facilitate more rapid and effective monetary policy interventions, including direct transfers of funds to citizens during economic crises\u2014often referred to as \u201chelicopter money.\u201d Such a mechanism could enhance the speed and accuracy of fiscal stimulus, bypassing traditional banking channels that may become impaired in crises (source: Knowledge Archive).\n\nAdditionally, CBDCs could allow central banks to implement negative interest rates more effectively, which traditional monetary policy often struggles to do due to the zero lower bound on cash. Studies suggest that a properly designed CBDC could remove this limitation, providing central banks with greater flexibility to combat deflation (source: Knowledge Archive).\n\n### 4. **Enhanced Financial Inclusion**\nCBDCs hold promise for improving financial inclusion, especially in regions where traditional banking services are lacking. Evidence from pilot programs, such as in Nigeria, indicates that CBDCs can significantly enhance access to banking services among unbanked populations, thereby broadening economic participation (source: Digital Finance). If designed with specific features such as low transaction costs and minimal identity requirements, CBDCs could facilitate financial integration for underbanked demographics, ultimately contributing to economic resilience (source: BIS).\n\n### 5. **Cybersecurity and Privacy Challenges**\nThe cybersecurity risks associated with CBDCs cannot be overlooked. Research indicates that without appropriate security measures, CBDCs could be susceptible to cyberattacks, similar to existing vulnerabilities in banking systems (source: Atlantic Council). Effective safeguards must be established to maintain consumer trust, as compromised data could undermine the integrity of the entire financial system (source: Federal Reserve). Moreover, addressing the privacy concerns tied to transaction tracking and data retention is essential, necessitating robust legal frameworks to safeguard user data while ensuring compliance with financial regulations (source: World Economic Forum).\n\n### 6. **Industry Adaptation and Innovation**\nTraditional banks will need to innovate and adapt quickly to remain relevant amidst the rise of CBDCs. A proactive approach involving collaboration with fintech firms and integration of new technologies is necessary to create hybrid banking models that leverage both CBDCs and conventional banking services. Evidence from ongoing trials suggests that banks that pre-emptively innovate may better navigate the disruptive effects of CBDCs (source: Payline Data).\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, while CBDCs promise transformative benefits across various dimensions of the financial system, they also pose substantial challenges and risks that necessitate careful planning and proactive measures. The next five years will likely see the gradual rollout of CBDCs, and as such, stakeholders must prioritize the establishment of frameworks that ensure robustness, security, and adaptability to uphold both financial stability and the integrity of the banking sector. Continuous monitoring of consumer attitudes towards CBDCs, diligent safeguarding of cybersecurity concerns, and innovative responses from traditional banks will be vital in shaping a resilient digital economy."
