Some countries such as the US and UK are conducting research but have not announced an intention to begin CBDC development, while others - including China and Sweden - have launched live pilot programs.3 Motivations cited by central banks for pursuing CBDCs include maintaining control over monetary policy, financial inclusion,4 traceability of transactions for anti-money laundering (AML) and tax purposes, and improved cross-border payments.5 Critics have been quick to note that CBDCs could pose data security and privacy concerns as well as reduce deposits at banks, which could reduce liquidity in the financial system.6 While it will likely take years to launch a digital dollar if the US decides to pursue its development, there are steps that financial institutions can take now to prepare themselves for potential domestic and global shifts toward CBDCs. This Regulatory brief provides our perspective on how CBDCs could impact the business models of financial institutions as well as how existing custody, blockchain, cybersecurity and other functions can be adapted to support CBDCs. 6 For more information, see the Bank Policy Institute\\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs, Benefits and Major Implications for the U.S. Economic System (April 2021).\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: [PDF] The impact of central bank digital currency on central bank ...\\nURL: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op360~35915b25bd.en.pdf\\nCONTENT: ECB Occasional Paper Series No 360 1 Contents Abstract 2 Non-technical summary 3 1 Introduction 5 2 CBDC: a future monetary liability of central banks 8 2.1 The \\u201cendogeneity\\u201d of the CBDC issuance decision and emerging CBDC design features 8 2.2 Issuance of CBDC and the central bank\\u2019s balance sheet 11 3 The impact of CBDC on central bank profitability \\u2013 measured by net interest income 15 3.1 Methodological approach 15 3.2 Profit projections with CBDC \\u2013 baseline analyses using euro area data as an example 18 3.3 Sensitivity analyses 21 4 Impact of CBDC on central bank financial risk-taking 26 5 Impact of CBDC on central bank capital and net equity 30 6 Conclusion 33 7 References 35 ECB Occasional Paper Series No 360 2 Abstract As digital payments become increasingly popular, many central banks are looking into the issuance of retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a new central bank monetary liability in addition to banknotes and commercial bank reserves.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: [PDF] Working Paper on Central Bank Digital Currency - CBDC - BfDI\\nURL: https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Berlin-Group/20240613_WP-Cental-Bank-Digital-Currency-EN.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2\\nCONTENT: Jun 13, 2024 \\u00b7 provide financial entities involved, such as central and commercial banks, with unprecedented access ...

In fact, there is considerable demand for currencies with low transaction costs, particularly for international transactions or for micro-contributions and micro-payments. [For example, the e-yuan has a transaction cost of 0.1%, compared with the 2% that credit card companies may charge].High transaction costsAny asset has the potential to be used as a currency, but very few succeed in becoming a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. Bitcoin, in particular, is a long way from achieving this. Bitcoin's transaction costs are still high. What's more, it has not yet adopted the two-sided payment card model (which involves charging the merchant and not the buyer, or even subsidizing the latter through discounts or free miles for using the card); today bitcoin serves essentially, at least in developed countries, as a store of value/speculative tool and has few benefits for transactions, apart from illegal ones.High volatilityThe very high volatility of cryptocurrency values is another factor making their use as a unit of account for contracts unlikely. This is why some cryptocurrencies are designed as stablecoins; the most important of these stablecoins today is Tether. The idea is to match the cryptocurrency with a collateral that guarantees its value. This collateral can take several forms. It can consist of securities issued in a traditional currency (such as the dollar), for example Treasury bills, or tomorrow a central bank digital currency (CBDC). These reserves must then be in sufficient quantity to peg the cryptocurrency to the chosen currency. But, of course, this requires an attentive prudential supervisor. For, as with all financial institutions, there is a strong temptation to invest in riskier, higher-yield assets than in relatively safe but low-yield ones (which is why the monitoring of the liquidity requirements imposed on banks by Basel 3 regulations is always a tricky business). In fact, in 2021, Tether, whose dollar reserves were supposed to correspond 1 for 1 to the number of tokens, was ordered by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to pay $41 million for claiming to be 100% covered by fiat currency, when in fact only 27.6% was covered. In addition, the platform may wish to grant loans to affiliated companies, which it must be prevented from doing.The need for a regulatorThere are, of course, other possible forms of collateral: financial assets, stored commodities (durable goods), raw materials, or even... other crypto-currencies (which might be useful if the values of crypto-currencies were negatively correlated, but unfortunately they seem to be positively correlated). In any case, only a prudential regulator, such as the ones for banks, can guarantee the public that the institution doesn't get too comfortable with the rules it has laid down.Moreover the nationality of this regulator is an important issue as crypto-currencies and the corresponding investors are totally global. One of the traditional roles of the banking regulator is to protect small depositors, SMEs and other regulated institutions against the risk of bankruptcy of the bank where their savings or liquid assets are deposited: see my book with Mathias Dewatripont The Prudential Regulation of Banks (MIT Press, 1994) for a discussion of the philosophy of prudential supervision. A national regulator may in fact be torn between the desire to enhance the attractiveness of its financial center (by attracting cryptocurrency-related businesses) and that of protecting those investors located on its territory, who are only a fraction of all investors, which therefore leads it to favor the former objective.The central position of the statesAgainst this backdrop, competition for leadership in digital payments will take place among at least three groups of players: decentralized cryptocurrencies, sponsored private currencies (Libra/Diem or any other Big Tech currency) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Central banks were late to enter this market, despite the competitive advantages they enjoy: the state decides what is legal tender, and can therefore force at least an optional use of its currency. This option becomes an obligation when it comes to the payment of taxes and other state levies. Finally, the state can force banks and fintech to join the state platform, as was the case for the renminbi in China and for Pix (a digital payments platform managed by the central bank) in Brazil. States will also be able to enter into agreements to make international transfers cheap, by ensuring that they are carried out automatically at the exchange rate prevailing on a highly liquid CBDC currency market. Finally, and mirroring the point already made in the previous article in this dossier about crypto-currencies, the positive benefit of CBDCs can quickly change sign in an autocratic state. The digital aspect of CBDCs will facilitate the surveillance and repression of citizens. Any additional power given to states requires the existence of the rule of law.Who will access CBDCs?The contours of this central bank digital currency have yet to be defined. In particular, who will be able to hold CBDCs, and in what proportions? Retail depositors? Those holding wholesale deposits (uninsured deposits)? What competition will there be for bank deposits? On this last point, there seems to be an emerging consensus that banks should not be drained of their stable funds. According to China's central bank, \\\"the new digital currency is not intended to replace deposits in bank accounts and balances held by payment apps such as Alipay and WeChat\\\". Similarly, a 2020 report from seven major central banks and the Bank for International Settlements defines the first of its three core principles in the following terms: \\\"Coexistence with cash and other types of currency in a flexible and innovative payment system.\\\" Be that as it may, we must once again remember the economic fundamentals.The digital revolution, by facilitating the introduction of new currencies, foreshadows intense competition between the private and public sectors and among countries to offer efficient services for savings, transactions and contract writing. While it's difficult to predict the outcome, we can bet that the few economic fundamentals discussed in this article will be at the center of developments.Not all deposits can be guaranteed and/or demandableFirst and foremost, not all deposits in financial institutions are supposed to be guaranteed (protected in the event of the institution's difficulties). The risk-free nature of retail deposits up to a certain limit (\\u20ac100k in France per depositor and per institution) is currently guaranteed by the State. Ideally, this guarantee is provided by a sufficiently robust deposit guarantee fund; failing that, it comes from a bailout by the state, provided the latter is solvent. In normal times, however, deposits are covered by loans (narrow banking is suboptimal). It should also be noted that Basel's prudential supervision rules now rightly insist on a minimum amount of equity and bailinable liabilities for banks. Unfortunately, all too often, deposit guarantees apply to all depositors, whether or not the deposits are insured, as we saw again recently with the near-bankruptcy of Cr\\u00e9dit Suisse.Secondly, not all deposits in financial institutions are supposed to be demandable. If the transformation function of banks can be schematized by the characterization that banks on average accept demand deposits and lend on a long-term basis, it is normal for banks to have a portion of their liabilities in securities that are only payable at term (and compensate investors for this concession). This partly limits the banks\\u2019 liquidity risk.What to do?Broader access to CBDCs would considerably increase the size of safe demand deposits. Is this desirable? Let's not forget that, if a significant part of the banks' liabilities were transferred to the central bank, the government would be obliged to grant loans to compensate for the lost bank loans. However, the government generally lacks the necessary expertise to grant loans; it may also show favoritism for political ends in granting these loans; and lastly, it may be too lenient with insolvent borrowers (the \\\"soft budget constraint\\\" phenomenon). A more conservative approach would be to limit the amount per capita that can be held in CBDCs. CBDCs would de facto be the new insured deposits of individuals, and would pay the deposit insurance premium. The advantage of CBDCs would then be greater ease of use and low transaction costs for households.Published in La Jaune & la Rouge, n\\u00b0 792, February 2024,https://www.lajauneetlarouge.com/magazine/792/Illustration Photo de Andr\\u00e9 Fran\\u00e7ois McKenzie sur UnsplashFebruary 01, 2024Cryptocurrencies: an economist's viewFebruary 05, 2024Financing the ecological transition in Sub-Saharan AfricaAuthorJean TiroleShareSame themeMay 23, 2024How can we convince farmers to use smart water meters?January 25, 2024How should we allocate capital and share risks?December 11, 2023Low-carbon transition: what impact on companies' cost of capital?\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/standards-and-interoperability-the-future-of-the-global-financial-system/\\nTitle: Untitled\\nContent:\\nDigital CurrenciesEconomy & BusinessFinancial RegulationIssue BriefApril 10, 2024Print this pageStandards and interoperability: The future of the global financial systemByAnanya Kumar, Alisha Chhangani, Jennifer Lassiter, and Katherine HaarTable of contentsIntroductionThe call for standardsDefining standardsA comprehensive overview of current standards on digital assetsLessons learned from standard-setting effortsEstablishing standardsKey themes for a CBDC frameworkConclusionAbstractOver the past few years, the global financial landscape has undergone a significant transformation marked by the emergence and integration of digital assets. Looking ahead, the global financial terrain is set to include a spectrum of both sovereign and nonsovereign digital currencies and both centralized and decentralized networks. This future brings the promise of enhanced efficiency, inclusion, transparency, and choice to global payments. To fulfill this promise, the international community must develop interoperability standards that prioritize a fast, highly scalable, and resilient architecture. The flexibility of this architecture to adapt configurability based on policy and economic considerations is critical to its success.This working paper is a foundational step toward a broader, global dialogue about digital asset standards. The Digital Dollar Project and the Atlantic Council\\u2019s GeoEconomics Center hosted a global convening titled \\u201cExploring Central Bank Digital Currency: Evaluating Challenges and Developing International Standards\\u201d in November 2023. A version of this paper was released as a working paper to level set the attendees of the conference and provide a call to engage the public and the private sector in standard-setting efforts. This paper was further developed based on feedback from the conference and outreach afterward. The paper now reflects what we learned from our convening and incorporates the most recent developments in standard-setting efforts globally. The rapid growth of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) worldwide underscores the importance of aligning approaches to their development, adoption, and implementation across technical, regulatory, and governance levels. Today, there is a patchwork of first steps undertaken by both public-and private-sector entities, aimed at achieving different objectives. These efforts have focused on frameworks, guiding principles, and, in some cases, the development of standards for digital assets broadly, as described below. Some are CBDC-specific and others have general applicability in the payments sector. As governments and stakeholders collaborate to establish consistent benchmarks for CBDC development, it\\u2019s crucial to identify, organize, and align standard-setting endeavors. This process involves assessing existing efforts to pinpoint gaps and create a foundation for international standards that remain open and flexible for future development and innovation. Through this paper, we show the crucial element of interoperability, which is needed for the furtherance of standards on CBDCs and digital assets. We attempt to build the pressing themes around which standards will have to be addressed through existing and new efforts.IntroductionIn recent years, the global financial landscape has witnessed a profound transformation characterized by the accelerated rise and integration of digital assets. As a subset of these assets, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have captivated the interest of countries worldwide.1Atlantic Council, \\u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency Tracker,\\u201d Atlantic Council, last updated December 2023,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/.The CBDC landscape has rapidly evolved with 130 countries, representing 98 percent of the global economy, actively researching and, in some cases, deploying CBDCs. A recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) revealed that the number of central banks likely to issue a CBDC within the next three years has grown in the past year from 15 percent to 18 percent for retail CBDCs (rCBDC) and from 8 percent to 15 percent for wholesale CBDCs (wCBDC).2Bank for International Settlements (BIS),Central Bank Digital Currency: Motivations and Implications, BIS Papers no. 136, November 2020,https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.htm.CBDCs, in their promise and potential, are emblematic of a broader shift\\u2014a movement toward a more efficient, frictionless digital infrastructure, shaping the future of international trade, cross-border payments, and global financial integration. However, with transformative potential comes inherent complexity. As fiat currencies become more intertwined with technology there are significant implications for privacy, human rights, cybersecurity, digital financial inclusion, and the movement of money across borders for international trade, aid, investment, and other payments. If designed without a common framework of standards and collaboration, a shortsighted and fragmented approach to CBDC development could lead to the emergence ofwalled gardens.At the core of establishing standards lies the concept of interoperability\\u2014the ability for diverse systems to interact seamlessly and reduce friction. In this context, interoperability extends beyond technical objectives alone; it requires a broader framework including regulatory and governance standards, paving the way for streamlined cross-border transactions, reduced operational friction, and bolstered trust among participating entities. While not a panacea, technical, regulatory, and governance benchmarks are instrumental in navigating the complexities of the international payments systems. In order to achieve interoperability, CBDC exploration should prioritize a thorough discussion on establishing technical, regulatory, and governance standards. (See Annex 1 for definitions relevant to this discussion.)This paper is intended as a catalyst to stimulate a broader, global dialogue about CBDC standards. It takes stock of existing activities, begins to define how these efforts may be coordinated and aggregated into a set of globally accepted best practices, and offers a baseline for addressing gaps or deficiencies in defining best practices.The call for standardsCBDCs are a digital form of a country\\u2019s national currency, issued and backed by the country\\u2019s central bank. They come in two forms: retail CBDCs (rCBDC), accessible to individual consumers and usable for everyday purchases and peer-to-peer payments, and wholesale CBDCs (wCBDC), utilized by financial institutions or other major entities for interbank settlements and large financial transactions. The motivations behind rCBDCs and wCBDCs are distinct. The deployment of rCBDCs is usually motivated by financial inclusion, payment efficiency, privacy, and safety. Interest in wCBDCs is aimed at addressing cross-border friction to improve international payments\\u2014including limited operating hours, long transaction chains, restrictions on legacy technology platforms, data fragmentation, high costs, complex funding, and compliance issues.3Josh Lipsky and Ananya Kumar, \\u201cIt\\u2019s Official: The United States Is Developing a Bank-to-Bank Digital Currency,\\u201dNew Atlanticist, Atlantic Council, December 15, 2022,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/its-official-the-united-states-is-developing-a-bank-to-bank-digital-currency/.Ultimately, rCBDCs and wCBDCs would operate in conjunction with each other to achieve both the domestic and cross-border needs of a country.4BIS, \\u201cProject Icebreaker Concludes Experiment for a New Architecture for Cross-border Retail CBDCs,\\u201d March 5, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/icebreaker.htm.Therefore, the deployment of domestic CBDCs must not be considered in isolation or the result will be walled gardens that stand apart from global commerce and economic trends. Creating a CBDC in a silo is unlikely to achieve the desired outcomes in the short or long term, as it will replicate the friction of the existing payments systems. CBDCs\\u2019 potential to provide a simpler and more efficient way to move money can only be realized as long as the CBDCs can interoperate with one another.If deployed, a CBDC must be able to operate across various transactions, institutions, and users. Many CBDC initiatives and explorations recognize the complex and interconnected ecosystem in which financial activity takes place and the interdependencies of the different participants in transaction settlements. By agreeing on standards upfront\\u2014which is by no means a simple task\\u2014CBDCs can hopefully escape some of the growing pains that we have seen with the development of new financial technology (such as automated teller machines that could only be used by customers of a specific bank) or new digital technology (such as the challenges posed by the early years of closed-loop email).Concentrating on developing and implementing clear and accessible global standards can enable greater industry collaboration and competitiveness through interoperability, transferability, consistency, and safety across various industries and economies. With this clarity, countries can direct their efforts toward aligning and promoting key principles such as privacy, free enterprise, the rule of law, and economic liberty within the global financial landscape.5The Digital Dollar Project:Exploring a US CBDC, Digital Dollar Foundation and Accenture, May 2020,https://digitaldollarproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Dollar-Project-Whitepaper_vF_7_13_20.pdf.Defining standardsAt the heart of this paper is the effort to promote interoperability in payments systems and prevent the creation ofwalled gardens. We therefore define standards as the technical, regulatory, and governance benchmarks needed to achieve interoperable systems in the long run. It is crucial to recognize that standards do not emerge arbitrarily; instead, they evolve from fundamental principles, embodying intentional consideration and consensus.Standards specific to CBDCs are not unchanging; they must reflect and be responsive to technological development, market shifts, and experience. Standards are established by technical and governance bodies, often made up of diverse stakeholders, and reflect a consistent floor for pragmatic implementation across jurisdictions. Therefore, they must have built-in flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances across a variety of market structures.Our use of a narrow definition of standards as a means to achieve interoperable payments systems helps navigate the complex technical, governance, and regulatory environment. In the following section, we catalog existing standards for digital assets and the institutions responsible for setting them.A comprehensive overview of current standards on digital assetsMethodologyDue to their rapid growth, global standard-setting bodies have had to regulate and harmonize the adoption and use of digital assets across borders. In this section we provide an overview of the prominent organizations that play a pivotal role in shaping the digital asset landscape. Understanding the functions, roles, and importance of these bodies is critical for fostering a safe, competitive, and inclusive digital economy. We explore global governance institutions\\u2014the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank for International Settlements\\u2014as well as regulatory standard setters\\u2014the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), and the Financial Stability Board (FSB)\\u2014and technical bodies like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Since rCBDC projects have largely been in the pilot, development, and research stage while wCBDC projects are currently limited, standard-setting efforts in some bodies have focused on broader digital asset developments.International Monetary FundAs a key institution in international monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability, the IMF is instrumental in assisting its 190 member countries in managing economic change. Its expertise in macrofinancial surveillance can help identify vulnerabilities associated with digital assets and it can offer policy advice to enhance the resilience of economies.In November 2023, the IMF released a virtual handbook on CBDCs, designed as a comprehensive guide for policymakers and experts in central banks and finance ministries. The plan for this evolving handbook is to offer about twenty chapters by 2026, with periodic updates to reflect the latest findings and viewpoints.6International Monetary Fund (IMF),Central Bank Digital Currency Virtual Handbook, last updated November 2023,https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/fintech/central-bank-digital-currency/virtual-handbook.The initial chapters address key topics like the framework for exploring CBDCs, product development, impacts on monetary policy, capital flow management, and financial inclusion.A publication called IMF Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency Capacity Development, released in April 2023, outlines the IMF\\u2019s efforts to facilitate peer learning and develop analytical underpinnings for advising member countries on CBDCs. In addition to research, the IMF provides technical assistance, including the XC platform initiative.7IMF,IMF Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency Capacity Development, Policy Paper, April 12, 2023,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2023/04/12/IMF-Approach-to-Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-Capacity-Development-532177.The XC platform, proposes a global centralized ledger to simplify and streamline cross-border payments. This initiative builds on the concept of wholesale CBDCs, but the platform includes commercial banks, payment providers, and central banks within a single, streamlined system. The XC model aims to reduce transaction costs and settlement times, making it an attractive option for countries looking to enhance their cross-border payment systems.Described as a \\u201cdigital town square,\\u201d the XC platform would build a three-layer architecture: a settlement layer that acts as the primary ledger, a programming layer for executing smart contracts, and an information layer designed to protect personal data while ensuring compliance and facilitating currency controls as needed.8Tobias Adrian and Tommaso Mancini Griffoli, \\u201cThe Rise of Payment and Contracting Platforms,\\u201d Fintech Notes No. 2023/005 (International Monetary Fund, June 19, 2023),https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fintech-notes/Issues/2023/06/16/The-Rise-of-Payment-and-Contracting-Platforms-534794.The platform\\u2019s architecture is designed to be open and upgradeable, ensuring its longevity and adaptability to future innovations. Instead of adopting CBDCs, central banks can issue certificates of escrow (CE) for use exclusively on the XC platform. CEs enhance financial accessibility by granting more entities, including nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), payment-system providers (PSPs), and nonresidents, direct access to central bank reserves. These certificates share characteristics with CBDCs and can later be converted into central bank reserves by financial institutions. According to the IMF, a key advantage of using CEs is that it allows countries to prioritize domestic use cases for their CBDC projects, while CEs can be used solely for cross-border transactions.9Tobias Adrian, \\u201cA Cross-Border Payments, Exchange, and Contracting Platform for the 21st Century,\\u201d International Monetary Fund, November 18, 2022,https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/11/18/sp-cross-border-payments-exchange-contracting-platform-21st-century.The XC model is designed for wide-ranging compatibility with existing systems, requiring central banks to make only minor technical updates. The model is a policy and regulatory framework; it encourages countries to adopt consistent and supportive regulations for cross-border payments, potentially incorporating tokens and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). In order for the model to work, however, it will need compatible legal and regulatory frameworks to effectively manage risks and ensure compliance across various jurisdictions. Tobias Adrian, Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the IMF, furtherexplainedthis point at ourconferencein November 2023.Bank for International SettlementsThe BIS acts as the central bank for central banks, fostering monetary and financial stability globally. It actively explores the impact of digital currencies on the financial system and central bank operations. The BIS Innovation Hub facilitates research and development on digital innovation, helping member countries adapt to the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Its membership consists of sixty-three central banks and monetary authorities.10\\u201cMember Central Banks,\\u201d BIS, n.d.,https://www.bis.org/about/member_cb.htm.Recent significant projects include Project Mariana, which tested cross-border trading using CBDCs and decentralized finance technology, and Project Icebreaker, which focused on using retail CBDCs for international payments through a novel hub-and-spoke model, both completing their testing phase in 2023.11\\u201cBIS Innovation Hub projects,\\u201d BIS, accessed November 26, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/projects.htm?m=268&#8203.Most recently, Project Sela, a collaboration between the BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre, the Bank of Israel, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, focused on exploring rCBDC features including accessibility, cyber security, and effective public-private collaboration, with an emphasis on central banks overseeing retail ledgers and private intermediaries managing customer-facing services.12B\\u00e9n\\u00e9dicte Nolens, \\u201cProject Sela: An Accessible and Secure Retail CBDC Ecosystem,\\u201d a joint experiment by BIS and the central banks of Hong Kong SAR and Israel, September 12, 2023.In July 2023, the BIS presented the results of a survey showing that 93 percent of central banks are engaged in CBDC work, with retail CBDC development more advanced than wholesale CBDC.13Anneke Kosse and Ilaria Mattei, \\u201cMaking Headway\\u2013Results of the 2022 BIS Survey on Central Bank Digital Currencies and Crypto,\\u201d BIS Papers no. 136, BIS, July 10, 2023,https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.htm.The survey reveals most central banks recognize the value of having both a retail CBDC and a fast payment system.14Kosse and Mattei, \\u201cMaking Headway.\\u201dBy 2030, there could be fifteen retail and nine wholesale CBDCs publicly circulating, while stablecoins and crypto assets are rarely used for payments outside the crypto ecosystem.15Kosse and Mattei, \\u201cMaking Headway.\\u201dThis BIS finding followed its June 2021 report discussing its survey on CBDCs, which found that many central banks had not decided on issuing a CBDC, but had a tentative inclination toward allowing cross-border use by tourists and nonresidents. In March 2021, the BIS explored the potential for multi-CBDC (mCBDC) arrangements to improve cross-border payments by leveraging interoperable central bank digital currencies. Technology could play a role in addressing inefficiencies, and the paper discusses the dimensions of payment system interoperability and the benefits of mCBDC arrangements.16\\u201cProject mBridge: Experimenting with a Multi-CBDC Platform for Cross-border Payments,\\u201d BIS, last updated October 31, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/mcbdc_bridge.htm.The BIS Universal Ledger interoperability model advocates for a shared global ledger that integrates various forms of money\\u2014including CBDCs, tokenized deposits, and other digital financial assets\\u2014into a single, programmable environment. The BIS aims to address the inefficiencies and silos present in the financial system by enabling safer transactions and atomic settlements within a transparent framework.The architecture of the unified ledger model is designed to be secure, scalable, and interoperable, with a strong emphasis on privacy and regulatory compliance. At its core, the architecture includes a data environment for securely storing digital asset representations, like CBDCs and tokenized deposits, in organized partitions managed by authoritative entities such as central banks and commercial banks. The execution environment facilitates the automation of complex financial operations and secure, efficient transaction processing. This environment supports atomic settlement, ensuring comprehensive transaction success or complete rollback. In addition, to safeguard sensitive data and transaction privacy, the model implements cryptographic methods like homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. These technologies enable encrypted data computation without exposing the actual data, reinforcing the system\\u2019s privacy and security. An important component of the BIS project is the governance framework that establishes operational and regulatory compliance protocols, while also detailing the responsibilities of all involved parties, including central and commercial banks.Unlike the XC model, which builds on blockchain solutions, the BIS\\u2019s unified ledger approach uses application programming interfaces (APIs), creating a more centralized system where transactions have to be processed and validated by authorized entities, such as central banks or designated financial institutions.17Adrian, \\u201cCross-Border Payments.\\u201dWithin this system, central bank money can circulate on a platform that is not owned and operated by the central bank, which can present risks. It also raises questions about the security, control, and integrity of central bank money when it is managed outside the traditional central banking systems.The BIS favors a system grounded in central bank money, offering a sounder basis for innovation, stable and interoperable services across borders, and a virtuous circle of trust through network effects.18Agust\\u00edn Carstens, \\u201cThe Future Monetary System: From Vision to Reality,\\u201d Keynote Speech at the CBDC & Future Monetary System Seminar, Seoul, Korea, November 23, 2023, via BIS site,https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp231123.htm.Basel Committee on Banking SupervisionThe BCBS is the global body for setting prudential standards for banking supervision and regulation.

Its recommendations function as guidance on regulating virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to ensure the prevention of illicit financial activities. More than 200 jurisdictions have committed to implementing FATF standards, making the organization a key player in shaping regulatory frameworks to maintain transparency and security in the digital asset sphere.21Financial Action Task Force (FATF), FATF,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html.FATF has thirty-eight member countries, including major economies and financial centers worldwide.22That number includes the Russian Federation, whose membership has been suspended. See \\u201cFATF Member Countries,\\u201d FATF website,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html.FATF has published several papers related to virtual assets and VASPs. The first version of its Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and VASPs, released in June 2019, focused on risk assessment and monitoring, particularly for issues of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).23FATF,Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, 2019,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets.html.A twelve-month review of the revised FATF standards on virtual assets and VASPs was conducted in July 2020, showing progress in implementing these standards among some jurisdictions, but not yet sufficient progress to create a global AML/CFT regime for virtual assets.24FATF,Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach: Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, October 2021,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html.A second twelve-month review in June 2022 revealed continued progress, but indicated that implementation was still insufficient and certain challenges remained, such as the implementation of the \\u201ctravel rule.\\u201d25Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, FATF, June 2022,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html.This rule is a legal obligation that requires financial institutions\\u2014such as banks and cryptocurrency service providers\\u2014to collect and share detailed information about the parties involved in a financial transaction.To address these challenges and based on the two reviews, FATF published Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and VASPs in October 2021. This guidance includes updates in six key areas, including clarifying the definitions of virtual assets and VASPs, guidance on stablecoins, and additional guidance on peer-to-peer transactions and information-sharing among VASP supervisors.26FATF, \\u201cUpdated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers.\\u201dHowever, the latest update on the implementation, published in June 2023, indicated that jurisdictions still struggle with fundamental requirements.27FATF, \\u201cVirtual Assets: Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers,\\u201d June 27, 2023,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2023.html.The report also emphasizes the need for appropriate risk identification and mitigation measures, especially for decentralized finance (or DeFi) and unhosted wallets (e.g., controlled by the owner rather than a platform or exchange manager), which have the potential for misuse. In 2020, FATF has also reported to the Group of Twenty (G20) on stablecoins, outlining its specific views on the application of anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing requirements.28FATF, \\u201cFATF Report to G20 on So-called Stablecoins,\\u201d June 2020,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Virtualassets/Report-g20-so-called-stablecoins-june-2020.html.There is ongoing work needed to ensure consistent and effective implementation of FATF standards in the digital asset sphere, and some jurisdictions are still struggling with fulfilling the fundamental requirements outlined by FATF.International Organization of Securities CommissionsAs the leading international standard-setting body for securities regulation, IOSCO plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and efficiency of capital markets. With a growing interest in digital securities, IOSCO\\u2019s principles on issuer and investor protection, market integrity, and risk mitigation have significant implications for the global adoption of tokenized assets. IOSCO has more than 120 members, including national securities regulators and exchanges from various jurisdictions.29FATF,International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism & Proliferation: The FATF Recommendations, as amended November 2023,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Fatf-recommendations.html.While debates on which digital assets count as securities are ongoing in the United States, IOSCO has been actively engaged in providing insights into the realm of digital asset markets through a series of consultation reports and public reports.Policy Recommendations for Crypto and Digital Asset Markets, published in November 2023, stands out as a comprehensive consultation report proposing eighteen recommendations that address six key areas of concern. These areas include conflicts of interest resulting from vertical integration, market manipulation, cross-border risks, custody and client asset protection, operational and technological risks, and retail access, suitability, and distribution.30International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),Policy Recommendations for Crypto and Digital Asset Markets: Final Report, November 16, 2023,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD747.pdf.In March 2020, IOSCO releasedGlobal Stablecoin Initiatives, a public report emphasizing the applicability of principles for financial market infrastructures to stablecoin arrangements with systemically important functions. IOSCO\\u2019s work on exchange traded funds and crypto-asset trading platforms may also apply to global stablecoins.31IOSCO,Global Stablecoin Initiatives: Public Report, March 2020, PDF,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD650.pdf.In March 2022, IOSCO presented its public report on decentralized finance, highlighting regulatory concerns like fraud risks, flash loans, cybersecurity, and spillover effects on traditional markets. Additionally, in December 2020, the organization publishedInvestor Education on Crypto-Assets,a report to educate the public and investors on crypto assets and risk mitigation.32IOSCO,Investor Education on Crypto-Assets: Final Report, December 2020,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD668.pdf.Committee on Payments and Market InfrastructuresUnder the BIS, the CPMI provides a platform for central banks to promote the safety and efficiency of payment systems worldwide. With digital assets gaining recognition, the CPMI is actively engaging in discussions concerning the potential role of CBDCs and their interplay with private cryptocurrencies. The CPMI has twenty-eight members, representing major central banks and monetary authorities.A 2018 Markets Committee report titledCentral Bank Digital Currenciesintroduces and defines CBDCs, assessing their potential implications for monetary policy and central bank operations.33Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI),Central Bank Digital Currencies, CPMI Markets Committee, March 12, 2018,https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.htm\\u200b.It recommends further research on various aspects including interest rates, financial stability, and exchange rates. The report also warns against the risks of private digital tokens due to their volatility and lack of protection for investors and consumers, making them unsuitable for widespread use in payments.Financial Stability BoardThe FSB\\u2019s mandate is to oversee and coordinate global financial regulation, identifying and addressing systemic risks to foster stability in the financial system. Recognizing the growing importance of digital assets, the FSB monitors developments and potential risks arising from their use and ensures that the digital asset market operates within established stability parameters.34Financial Stability Board, \\u201cCrypto-assets and Global \\u2018Stablecoins,\\u2019 \\u201d n.d.,https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/financial-innovation-and-structural-change/crypto-assets-and-global-stablecoins/\\u200b\\u200b.The FSB is broadly focused on the global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities, and has not released any specific research or guidelines on CBDC development. The board\\u2019s membership includes a combination of G20 economies, other major economies, and international organizations.35Financial Stability Board, \\u201cCrypto-assets and Global \\u2018Stablecoins.\\u2019International Organization for StandardizationThe ISO fosters agreement on best practices and processes, and publishes standards and technical specifications (TS), including on the security aspects for digital currencies. ISO/TS 23526:2023 focuses on providing a security framework for the issuance and management of digital currencies in general, using cryptographic mechanisms standardized by ISO and other references. The document aims to integrate security aspects into the design of digital currency systems, as opposed to adding them later as an extra layer, to accommodate legacy infrastructures\\u200b.\\u200b36\\u201cISO/TS 23526:2021,\\u201d Online Browsing Platform, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), accessed November 26, 2023,https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:ts:23526:ed-1:v1:en.ISO does not have any explicit references or guidelines on CBDCs\\u2019 technical security, but instead has a broader focus on digital currencies overall.The following organizations below were added after the conference and depict wide-ranging efforts for interoperability occurring both in the private and public sector.Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial TelecommunicationBuilding on its legacy in global financial messaging, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) has introduced a model to enhance its existing infrastructure for cross-border payments, making them faster, more transparent, and cost-effective. Currently in beta testing, this model facilitates the connection of disparate national CBDC networks, enabling them to communicate and transact with one another while leveraging Swift\\u2019s existing infrastructure and security protocols\\u2014best thought of as a hub-and-spoke arrangement between various central banks with Swift at the center. This initiative is part of a broader Swift effort to prevent the fragmentation of the global payments landscape into \\u201cdigital islands.\\u201d37\\u201cSwift Advances CBDC Innovation as Interlinking Solution Begins Beta Testing,\\u201d Swift, September 13, 2023,https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-advances-cbdc-innovation-interlinking-solution-begins-beta-testing.The project began in March 2023, with over eighteen participants, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Banque de France. Within a twelve-week period, they were able to process over 5,000 transactions. In September 2023, Swift further broadened the initiative by announcing the participation of three new central banks: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Central Bank of Kazakhstan, and an additional, anonymous central bank.Following the insights and successes from Phase 1, Swift released the takeaways from the Phase II CBDC sandbox project in March 2024, engaging thirty-eight central banks, commercial banks, and market infrastructures from around the globe. This project was designed to tackle complex use cases and assess solutions within a controlled sandbox environment. The second phase involved over 125 participants, who collectively executed more than 750 transactions. The sandbox was hosted on Kaleido, a Web3 platform for blockchain applications, where central banks were able to simulate CBDC transactions. Swift\\u2019s technology stack included a combination of the Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, and Hyperledger Besu platforms.38\\u201cSwift Advances CBDC Innovation,\\u201d Swift.Phase II explored four new use cases. First, it demonstrated the automation of trade payments through CBDC networks and smart contracts, aiming to improve trade efficiency and minimize costs. Second, it evaluated two models for foreign exchange trade and settlement: an International Foreign Exchange Marketplace and a Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) inspired system, both of which underscored the integration of CBDC trade and settlement. Third, the project focused on delivery versus payment (DvP), facilitating atomic DvP for tokenized bonds by ensuring interoperability between tokenization platforms and CBDC networks. Finally, it investigated mechanisms to mitigate liquidity fragmentation across various currencies and platforms, utilizing smart contracts and netting algorithms. The report established three foundational principles for interoperability: linking networks via ISO 20022 messaging, providing a unified point of access through Swift, and ensuring coexistence with traditional market infrastructures.39\\u201cSwift Advances CBDC Innovation as Interlinking Solution Begins Beta Testing,\\u201d Swift, September 13, 2023,https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-advances-cbdc-innovation-interlinking-solution-begins-beta-testing.This model leverages Swift\\u2019s global reach and the existing network effects among financial institutions. It also offers flexibility for countries to maintain their own domestic CBDC infrastructure while ensuring global connectivity.The Internet Engineering Task ForceThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is deeply involved in the development of standards to enhance blockchain interoperability, focusing on the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP).40\\u201cSecure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP),\\u201d Internet Engineering Task Force, accessed April 6, 2024,https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/satp/about/.This protocol is designed to enable seamless transfers of digital assets across diverse distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) by leveraging a network of trusted gateways, akin to the role border gateway routers played in the early internet. Such an approach offers a scalable and ledger-agnostic solution for the rapidly evolving digital asset ecosystem.SATP facilitates asset transfers through a structured process that includes three main stages: Transfer Initiation, Lock-Evidence Verification, and Commitment Establishment. The protocol ensures that digital assets are exclusively valid within one network at any given time, adopting a transfer mechanism that maintains the asset\\u2019s integrity and uniqueness.41Andre Augusto, Rafael Belchior, Imre Kocsis, Laszlo Gonczy, Andre Vasconcelos, and Miguel Correia, \\u201cCBDC Bridging between Hyperledger Fabric and Permissioned EVM-based Blockchains,\\u201d paper presented at INESC-ID and Instituto Superior Tecnico, 2023,https://www.dpss.inesc-id.pt/~mpc/pubs/Augusto-CBDC-2023.pdf.This is achieved through the strategic use of gateway endpoints which manage the transfer process, ensuring secure, transparent, and auditable transactions that adhere to Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) principles.42Martin Hargreaves, Thomas Hardjono, and Rafael Belchior, \\u201cSecure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) Core,\\u201d draft-ietf-satp-core-04 (Internet-Draft), Internet Engineering Task Force, ,https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-satp-core/.The SATP framework comprises a comprehensive set of API endpoints and resources for the initiation and execution of asset transfers. It also aims to facilitate the integration and management of digital asset transactions, contributing to a more efficient and secure digital economy.Hyperledger, an open-source community focused on blockchain technologies, plays a role in implementing and advancing SATP through projects like Hyperledger Cacti.43\\u201cCacti, \\u201cHyperledger Foundation,https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/cacti.Cacti serves as a blockchain integration framework that enhances interoperability by allowing operations across multiple enterprise-grade blockchain networks. It achieves this through a pluggable architecture that supports Business Logic Plugins (BLP) and Ledger Connectors, enabling seamless interaction with various DLTs.Global Blockchain Business CouncilThe GBBC has launched the fourth iteration of the Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI 4.0), a comprehensive project designed to map and analyze the blockchain and digital assets landscape.44\\u201cGlobal Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI),\\u201d Global Blockchain Business Council,https://gbbcouncil.org/gsmi/.This initiative provides an extensive overview of regulatory developments across 230 jurisdictions and six global bodies, compiles a taxonomy of 350 terms and definitions, maps sixty-three technical standards bodies, and identifies more than 2,000 stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, it offers access to 1,500+ courses from accredited educational institutions and includes four in-depth reports focusing on AI convergence, digital identity, supply chain, and sustainability, with a special spotlight on Brazil. GSMI 4.0, building on the work since 2020, aims to present a holistic view of global industry activity. The initiative\\u2019s resources, including an interactive map of blockchain and digital asset regulations and a series of reports, are available on the GSMI site (https://gbbcouncil.org/gsmi/). All materials produced by the GSMI are crowd-sourced and open access, ensuring they serve as a reliable information source for those interested in blockchain and digital assets.The Internet Governance ForumThe Internet Governance Forum (IGF), primarily serves as a multistakeholder platform for policy dialogue on internet governance issues.45\\u201cAbout Us,\\u201d Internet Governance Forum, accessed March 1, 2024,https://www.intgovforum.org/en/about.While not directly implementing or proposing specific financial systems, the IGF\\u2019s contribution lies in facilitating discussions, building consensus, and sharing best practices among stakeholders to influence the governance frameworks that underpin these technologies. First convened in 2006 by the United Nations secretary-general as a result of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) held in 2003 and 2005, IGF gathers governments, the private sector, civil society, and technical communities to debate and share insights on enhancing internet security, ensuring digital privacy, fostering the digital economy, and expanding internet access.Security, trust, and privacy are central to the IGF\\u2019s discussions on digital financial services. The forum encourages dialogue on how to protect against fraud, ensure the integrity of digital transactions, and safeguard users\\u2019 privacy and data in an increasingly digital global economy. Key areas of focus for the IGF also include the development of governance frameworks that protect user data and ensure a secure online environment. The forum also emphasizes the importance of digital inclusion, advocating for equitable access to the internet and digital services across different regions and communities. Through its annual meetings and intersessional work, the IGF indirectly supports the infrastructure and policies that impact the digital economy and financial inclusivity.As the above section shows, there have been some efforts in creating standards for interoperability of digital assets. From feedback after the conference, we added the work of organizations such as Swift, IETF, GBBC, and IGF in standard creation. All the organizations listed above have led to important standard making efforts as described. However, these efforts are concentrated in specific areas and, as explored below, some crucial gaps exist that must be addressed in any evolving framework for standards.Lessons learned from standard-setting effortsAs we evaluate the above models of governance, it is important to assess growth opportunities for the next stage of standard developments. In this section, we identify the critical learnings and gaps in standards development for interoperability of digital assets.First, the rCBDC experimentation space has provided countries with some experience in building CBDCs, largely driven by domestic objectives. These experiments are at very different stages and use a range of private-sector vendors that are not subject to the same regulations due to a slower pace of crypto-asset regulation globally.Second, within wCBDC experimentation, operating frameworks in technology and regulation have emerged, led by entities like the BIS Innovation Hub, the global financial-messaging cooperative Swift, and other private-sector players. However, they are constrained by the limited number of participating countries, furthering the issue of fragmentation in cross-border CBDCs. Current experimentation should incorporate standards-setting bodies (SSBs) such as FSB, BCBS, CPMI, ISO, and FATF as participants or observers to ensure better collaboration in the development of standards.The membership structure of SSBs significantly influences the establishment of the goals and priorities of these institutions. Additionally, while emerging market economies often surpass developed economies in the development of digital infrastructure, including CBDCs, they sometimes find themselves underrepresented in setting norms and establishing benchmarks. This underrepresentation can result in an inadequate consideration of their technological advancements within the organization\\u2019s priorities.Moreover, apart from the FATF, there seems to be a shortage of robust frameworks for assessing the global standards\\u2019 impact and implementation lags. To address the evolving landscape of financial technologies, it is imperative that new and non-financial SSBs be actively involved in these discussions, leveraging their expertise in technological matters and regulatory concerns.Finally, some of the above frameworks have actively involved private sector participants in influencing standard development and creation. As intermediaries, the private sector has a crucial role in the entire lifecycle of standards, from actively influencing the creation of standards to ultimately adopting and implementing them.Towardsestablishing standardsA transparent and collaborative multi-stakeholder approach is crucial for establishing frameworks for standards related to digital currencies. Standardization is driven by consultation processes with governments, industry specialists, consumers, regulators, and civil society organizations (CSOs). Historically, governments have provided the necessary legal and governance paradigms, in turn creating environments conducive to standard development and assimilation across multi-stakeholder groups. Central banking authorities, driven by the imperative of maintaining financial stability and directing monetary policy, contribute a nuanced perspective essential for shaping these standards. The private sector\\u2019s technological advancements and practical exposure play a critical role, not just in ideation, but in the tangible implementation of these standards, ensuring their practical efficacy. Lastly, the participation of CSOs provides reflection and inclusion of key social elements, serving as a check by society on the suitability of resulting standards.The goal of this collaborative process is the establishment of a guiding framework for standards. To begin this process, we outlined the following themes for CBDC framework creation, which align with the G7 principles proposed in 2021, to identify the key themes necessary to begin building a framework. These key themes are governance; privacy and data protection; competition and consumer protection; global impact and sustainability; and transferability and accessibility. Through conversations at the conference and outreach afterward, we aimed to test the robustness of these themes through a survey (see Annex 2 for survey questions). Within each theme, we describe the areas of framework development needed for the establishment of standards. Conference attendees and survey respondents identified thematic overlaps and largely agreed with these themes, which have allowed us to set policy priorities for CBDC frameworks.A thematic approach to CBDC and digital asset standard creationGovernanceEffective governance of CBDCs requires a nuanced approach, placing a focus on maintaining public policy objectives and central bank mandates including monetary and financial stability. To achieve this, the framework should involve the creation of dynamic mechanisms that not only monitor, but also proactively mitigate potential destabilizing effects. Stress-testing frameworks are essential tools for central banks to assess the comprehensive impact of CBDCs on economic stability. The principle of \\u201cdo no harm\\u201d dictates that economic stability must be safeguarded at every stage of CBDC implementation, through concrete guidelines and risk assessments. In parallel, there is an imperative to establish legal and governance frameworks, offering clear definitions of regulatory benchmarks. Governance is the biggest challenge that emerges as we analyze existing efforts for standard setting, as each of the technical models discussed at the conference envisions an operator of an inherently global system. This is a complex and difficult endeavor, likely to have many challenges and phases.Privacy and Data ProtectionThe protection of privacy and data involves specifying requirements for user data protection, consent, and disclosures.46The Digital Dollar Project, Digital Dollar Foundation and Accenture.Mechanisms for cross-border data transfer should be designed to navigate the complexities of various data protection laws across jurisdictions, ensuring compliance, individual privacy protections, and seamless transactions. Operational resilience and cybersecurity require technology standards for resilience against cyber, fraud, and operational risks, including security measures, encryption standards, and incident response protocols.47J.

ElliottlinkedinfacebooktwitterbirdemailExecutive SummaryWhy Focus On The Future Of MoneyParadigms For A Changing Competitive LandscapeFrom Paradigms To SolutionsEmerging Use CasesAuthorsDownload ReportExecutive SummaryDecentralized finance (DeFi)Money is about to undergo fundamental changes in the way it is created and used, potentially unleashing a dramatic reordering of the financial system. While volatility has shaken cryptocurrency markets over the past year and caused a string of failures, many parts of the digital asset ecosystem continue to advance largely unaffected by the turmoil, as we explored in anearlier paper. These include the areas with the greatest long-term potential to transform finance, including the tokenization of financial assets and deposits and the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) by most of the world\\u2019s largest economies. The rise of digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) continues to have the potential to upend the competitive landscape, creating new, efficient, nimble competitors, but also offering incumbents a potential new lease on life. Executives and policymakers need to stay focused on the opportunities and risks associated with digital assets.The future of digital assets as a whole depends heavily on the future of digital money, as payments power the financial system. However, digital money could evolve in quite different ways; for example, there are different forms of digital money that could form the basis of new approaches, spanning CBDCs, tokenized deposits and different types of stablecoins. Executives and policymakers must think in terms of multiple scenarios rather than relying on a single prediction. These approaches will transform business models as they favor different types of issuers and their adoption will reshape liquidity, market-making, and risk management, which could impact the broader financial system considerably.To help industry executives and policymakers frame their thinking, this report presents four paradigms based on the issuers of money, the technology they choose, and the use cases they target. Traditional financial institutions could successfully evolve or be challenged by the rise of digital intermediaries. Alternatively, universal networks could transform financial markets and business models, or sovereigns could expand their control of money and change the role for the private sector and its business models.In a world of significantly higher interest rates, the economic value generated from facilitating payments could be bigger and even more contested. Establishing valuable commercial propositions will be crucial to scaling different forms of digital money. Their viability, in turn, will depend on the policy landscape, technological innovations, and the infrastructure design choices that money issuers make. Each factor will play a role in determining the winners.Policymakers and senior leaders in the financial industry, both incumbents and disruptors, should consider a range of plausible future scenarios, evaluate their potential impact, plan responses for the most likely developments, and consider how to bring about the most desirable outcomes. This process may play out quite differently across cross-border payments, asset settlement, and retail domestic payments. We will follow up in coming months with papers that focus on these specific digital money use cases.The Future ScenariosWhy Focus On The Future of MoneyTechnology has transformed the way we think about and use money from the first electronic payments in the telegraph era to the rise of mobile payments and cryptocurrencies. Today that process is poised to accelerate dramatically. Distributed ledger technology (DLT), such as blockchain, is inspiring the creation of new forms of money, from central bank digital currencies and tokenized deposits to stablecoins. These digital monies have the potential to make payments faster, cheaper, and more secure, and enable new economic activity and business models.This transformation of money will both fuel and be driven by a broader transformation of the financial system. DLT is enabling the creation of a broad array of assets, from digitized versions of traditional financial instruments such as stock and bonds and historically illiquid assets like art, real estate, and intellectual property, to digitally native vehicles that offer novel ways to transfer value. These assets can attract participation by a wider range of entities and investors, as well as change how they participate, fostering the rise of new financial products and business models.Digital assets and technology also will change the shape of financial services and markets. By presenting transactional and ownership information on a single, shared ledger, DLT enables participants to transact with one another without the involvement of traditional financial intermediaries. It enables the automation and coordination of transaction processes among multiple stakeholders, which will change the cost and distribution of financial products. This could spur new private networks that displace existing intermediaries and allow greater automation and integration across borders and asset classes. Alternatively, it could create new opportunities for banks, exchanges, custodians, and other institutions that embrace DLT and adapt their business models.Money is at the heart of these innovations. A thriving digital assets market requires a seamless way to trade these assets. A digitally native solution that embeds money in the same distributed framework as the assets themselves will maximize the speed and cost-effectiveness of payments, as well the connectivity to associated services such as collateral management and yield enhancement. Of course, such a solution needs to be trusted, reliable, sustainable, and secure.While digital assets have the potential to transform the way we store and exchange value, their success ultimately depends on whether they can be integrated with the existing financial system. Such an integration has the potential to enable faster and more secure transactions across the financial system. Payments could be settled instantly and safely, at any time of day, and at the same time assets are exchanged, a process known as atomic settlement. The financial system could change significantly as digital money impacts liquidity, market-making, and risk management given its speed and automation.Evolution of Forms of MoneySource: Adapted fromIt\\u2019s Time to Explore Institutional DeFiEstablishing valuable commercial propositions will be key to scaling up digital money, but the viability of those propositions will depend heavily on the policy landscape and technological innovations. Capital and liquidity requirements will have a major impact on the feasibility of commercial propositions, while the integration of digital money across borders can create the critical mass to power new business models. But both of those elements require a coordinated approach by national regulators, which is still in an early phase. At the same time, advances in technology will drive whether platforms can handle the volume of activity needed. New platforms also face the classic chicken-and-egg problem: how to start attracting consumers and producers when the economic value generated by facilitating payments to participants depends on high transaction volume.Key players are making critical investments and strategic decisions now that will shape the future. In a world of significantly higher interest rates, the economic value generated by facilitating payments could be bigger and even more contested. Executives need to start preparing for the ways in which digital money can transform the competitive landscape in which they operate. We present four paradigms to paint the corners for how this transformation might play out. The future of money will likely combine a mix of these different paradigms, and in potentially different proportions across various sectors and use cases. Industry leaders should prepare for thefuture by considering the full range of plausible scenarios.Paradigms For A Changing Competitive LandscapeThe future of money isn't preordained. A vast number of market participants are working to reshape that future. Blockchain and digital native startups are developing innovative products and services that have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. Incumbent institutions like banks are investing in new products, such as digital asset custody and settlement solutions. Fintech firms are already making significant inroads in transforming the way money moves globally. Big tech firms are also exploring the potential for their own digital currencies and payment systems, leveraging their massive user bases and data analytics capabilities. Central banks are researching the potential for digital currencies to complement traditional ones. Finally, regulators will play a critical role in shaping which commercial propositions are both viable and safe.The future of money and payments can take radically different directions depending on the forms of money that gain scale, the technology designs issuers choose and use cases they target, how incentives are incorporated, and whether the regulatory and policy environment is favorable, among other factors.Changes to money itself can have a profound impact on the financial system at large. To help industry executives and policymakers frame their thinking, we introduce four paradigms based on the types of institutions that could produce solutions that scale. These paradigms are meant to support scenario planning and are likely to coexist. They are not comprehensive and do not cover every possibility, such as a future in which cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin become a major part of the payments system.Four ParadigmsPARADIGM ONETraditional Finance EvolvesDigital assets support the continued centrality of banks and other financial institutionThis paradigm represents an evolution of the existing system, not a revolution, as banks and other incumbent financial institutions continue to dominate. (We will generally say \\u201cbanks\\u201d for short.) It assumes that banks largely evolve successfully, with digital money supporting their continued centrality to the financial system.For this paradigm to take hold, financial institutions need to demonstrate the commercial value of digital assets. Experimentation will lead to viable business models as banks become leading enablers for the new technologies, tokenizing both money and assets. Momentum could grow as solutions cascade across the system, from core activities like asset issuance and treasury to areas like merchant solutions and payments. Policymakers will be key enablers, providing regulatory space for innovation and potentially pushing new networks that reinforce banks\\u2019 position. This paradigm also will become more likely if regulation slows down digital natives or puts limits on potential commercial models.If banks can evolve successfully, they would thrive by ensuring their key economic and intermediation roles, pursuing new opportunities while providing balance sheet to support trading and lending activities in new infrastructures that lower their cost bases. Modernization of payments and trading could drive major efficiencies for clients by reducing liquidity needs, which would impact banking costs and revenues. This could increase market concentration as smaller players are squeezed out by margin pressure as well as the cost of adopting new infrastructure and the fight for talent. Even as banks evolve, institutions would continue to face strong competition for client relationships, including from big tech.PARADIGM TWOSovereign ExpansionCentral banks use CBDCs to gain share in payment flowsIn this paradigm, central banks would provide retail or wholesale users with CBDCs and use their instantaneous settlement capabilities to pick up a significant share of payment flows. Although central banks considering CBDCs are currently aiming to play a core role in payments without greatly disturbing the existing financial system, this paradigm assumes the process goes much further than current plans and does indeed transform the system.Radical change in the role of the central bank would require societal support. Individuals could come to prefer the features provided by retail CBDCs. Alternatively, demand could be driven by investors and institutions who want to ensure their digital money is fully backstopped by the central bank. This diversion of payment flows from private money to public could have a significant impact on bank business models, which would have to rely more on equity and wholesale funding rather than deposits.While the role of the private sector in money issuance might decrease, central banks might continue to partner with the private sector to distribute and maintain access to money. This could mean new opportunities and fee-based business models focused on the distribution and allocation of public money. Banks could find themselves in tough competition with payment service providers or new digital intermediaries. There could be an increased role for technology companies in providing payment services and infrastructure, as central bank money is integrated into mainstream payment systems.With public money having a greater role in the economy, central banks may then have more tools to enact and control monetary supply, as well as more real-time data. This paradigm could lead to greater financial stability as central banks gain more visibility and control over the money supply, but also create the potential for unintended consequences and new risks to emerge. Financial institutions would need to adjust their business models to account for the change in payment flows, particularly interms of their balance sheets and funding models.PARADIGM THREERise of Digital IntermediariesIn between evolution and revolutionThis paradigm sits somewhere between evolution and revolution, with digital natives gaining scale as the traditional financial industry struggles to adapt. Banking could be squeezed, with digital natives controlling customer access and expanding financial services provided.This paradigm can take shape if digital assets gain scale with intermediaries carving out key areas for differentiation. This could include a trusted digital money solution, with stablecoin issuers gaining scale, or efficient and compliant market infrastructure solutions, such as cryptocurrency exchanges concentrating liquidity. To capture institutional flow, digital intermediaries will need regulatory acceptance of their business models. Profitability of digital natives would enable them to launch compelling new services across financial services, including lending, origination, and liquidity provision, while traditional finance players work to overcome legacy technology, culture, and regulatory obstacles. Integration across services could be established through cooperation across the value chain, or itself become a way for new digital intermediaries to emerge that provide the range of services.Powerful new companies could emerge that operate globally and squeeze other financial institutions out of client relationships, potentially starting with younger, early adopters. As a result, competition between financial services providers would start to move from control of operating accounts to custody, as money increasingly moves into stablecoins held in digital wallets. This suggests banks and financial market infrastructure firms would be hit by multiple pressures, including loss of business, pressure to pivot business models, and costs to accelerate digital asset capabilities. Beyond banks, competition between digital natives could also accelerate and would likely include the entry of big tech players. Smaller proprietary networks might push for interoperability to ensure continued relevance.PARADIGM FOURUniversal NetworksRevolution \\u2013 the financial system as we knowit is transformedThis is the most radical paradigm, one that would strongly transform the financial system. The rise of new open networks would enable borrowers and lenders, issuers and investors, and other market participants to deal directly, without intermediaries. Transactions would be powered and governed by smart contracts and institutional decentralized finance protocols. The trend toward capital market-based financing would be accelerated by algorithmic creation and allocation of credit over highly integrated networks. This could disrupt the business models of banks and today's digital natives.Radical change would require high levels of support. Policymakers could become more comfortable with this paradigm if there are trusted solutions to compliance and safeguards in existing networks. Alternatively, supranational organizations could enable cross-country collaboration for new platforms, such as the Bank for International Settlements\\u2019 (BIS) vision for a unified global ledger or the International Monetary Fund\\u2019s (IMF) proposal for a multi-currency marketplace. It\\u2019s also possible that trust is built over time through experimentation with new policy tools. The European Commission, for example, put out a tender for a study on embedded supervision of decentralized finance. Networks that are truly universal will also depend on convergence around shared standards, as well as continued advances in technology that enable both scale and trust.This paradigm would imply greater participation and expansion of capital markets, but participation models could change dramatically as users and investors are connected by automation instead of intermediaries. This would require financial services providers (or new types of organizations) making using of automation to also expand risk management capabilities and successfully build incentive models. If users can control their data and wallets, that could encourage new services that blur the lines between banking and commerce, enabling financial activities to become embedded and seamless. With the growth and expansion of market-based financing, investors and firms alike would need to become more sophisticated about risk management.From Paradigms To SolutionsParticipants are already planting the seeds of these various paradigms. Policymakers are taking decisions and companies are exploring commercial propositions that will determine which forms of money are viable. The networks where digital money is issued and gains scale will define who is in the running to offer new services. These seeds won\\u2019t sprout overnight but senior executives need to start preparing now. Money has network effects and digital money could scale at a rapid pace.Contesting Forms of Digital MoneyCompeting forms of moneyCompeting forms of money will feature different business models and economics for their issuers and will need to win the trust of users that nominal value can be maintained. Generally, issuers make a profit by earning an interest margin on the assets backing the money and by collecting fees on payments, transactions, and bundled services, while ensuring trust by appropriately backing the issuance. In a world of higher interest rates, the economic value generated from facilitating payments becomes more attractive.Central bank digital currenciesare a digital form of central bank liability.Many central banks are exploring CBDCs to ensure the money they issue continues as an anchor of value in an increasingly digital world. A retail CBDC would serve as a modern version of paper currency or coins: made available to all individuals but digitally native and more similar in experience to a bank account, with similar levels of data access by authorities. Several major economies are expected to launch retail CBDCs within the next five years, including China (which has been working on a digital yuan project since 2014), India, and the European Union. An expansive retail CBDC could divert deposits from the banking system, increase bank funding costs, and reduce bank interest income, which explains why many banks oppose the idea. Some central banks are looking to cap the amount an individual or firm may hold in CBDCs and ensure they seamlessly integrate with deposits, which could favor banks. On the other hand, CBDCs might create new fee-based income opportunities for payment service providers that partner in distribution, favoring new digital intermediaries.A wholesale CBDC is a modern version of reserves issued on new central bank platforms to help financial institutions, not consumers, transact more efficiently with each other. Countries are exploring them mainly for cross-border payments and to settle asset transactions. By speeding up wholesale payments, they would reduce the need for banks and corporations to tie up liquidity for two or more days. A wholesale CBDC would retain the two-tier structure of today\\u2019s financial system, whereby central bank money underpins private money creation by commercial banks and others. The paradigm it favors will depend on which types of institutions have access to wholesale CBDCs.Tokenized depositsare a digital form of a bank deposit issued by a regulated institution.They are recorded on a distributed ledger and intended to settle trades of tokenized real-world assets or other digital assets. Tokenized deposits could take on different forms, whether account or token-based. Financial institutions and central banks have only recently begun experimenting with these instruments, and many issues remain to be resolved in both regulation and business models. For example, from a regulatory perspective, it\\u2019s not clear how capital and liquidity requirements might need to evolve if tokenized deposits lead to different behaviors and usage. It\\u2019s also not clear how deposits from different institutions will be made interchangeable and whether new business models will emerge to solve for that.Issuing tokenized deposits would favor banks\\u2019 economic position by helping to secure their funding, which has traditionally relied on customer deposits, and providing a currency for participating in the digital asset sector. This could be a key driver for traditional finance to evolve successfully.Fiat-backed stablecoinsdigital assets designed to maintain a stable value against a national currency, such as the US dollar, backed by assets denominated in that currency.These instruments play a major role in crypto markets, with more than $7 trillion in transactions executed in 2022, and issuers are exploring their use for real-world payments. Most stablecoins do not pay interest, unlike deposits, which can provide significant value to issuers in a rising interest rate environment. They also generate fee income from transaction and treasury services that scale up with volume growth. Digital natives dominate the stablecoin market and they could develop powerful new intermediary roles as the use of these coins proliferates. Financial institutions have recently begun to issue their own stablecoins.Stablecoin growth will require coherent regulation, and potentially adjustments to existing business models. Maintaining a peg against the dollar or other currency depends both on appropriate reserves to manage normal outflows as well as access to backstops in the case of systemic events. The importance of maintaining a peg was highlighted by recent contagion events in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, where concerns around traditional finance deposits spread to crypto markets. Stablecoin regulation has evolved at a different rate across the globe. For example, the European Union\\u2019s new Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) regulation mandates that issuers hold reserves to back their coins; however, the United States might take years to develop comparable rules, given the need for legislation from a divided Congress.Decentralized stablecoinsare private sector-issued digital assets designed to maintain a stable value while backed by other digital assets.These represent a small fraction of total stablecoin transactions and their regulatory path is not as clear as fiat-backed stablecoins, especially given their reliance on decentralized governance. After the Terra/Luna collapse of 2022, coins relying on algorithms to maintain a peg have lost favor to designs based on overcollateralization. These stablecoins generate interest income from overcollateralized reserves, as well as fees from executing trades and collateral liquidation from margin calls.While a small fraction of current market activity, decentralized stablecoins could represent the frontier of innovation, making use of smart contracts and new governance designs to manage their balance sheets and distribute the economic value from issuance.These options are not exhaustive. The ease of swapping different digital assets through smart contracts means a wider variety of tokens can function like money to exchange value in a transaction. This can blur the lines between money and assets, enabling new business models while also creating new policy challenges. For example, funds kept with traditional money market funds need to be withdrawn to be used in payments, but this could change if money market fund tokens are recognized as means of payment in smart contracts or networks.Competing market infrastructure designsMarket infrastructure design and participation is becoming a key strategic and policy issue. In the traditional financial system, money and assets exist on separate networks, where banks have a privileged role in helping settle transactions. DLT-inspired technologies could upend this system and disintermediate banks. The more integrated and universal the network \\u2013 that is, the greater diversity of assets and stakeholders that a distributed network contains \\u2013 the higher the likelihood that new business models could emerge and disrupt banks.Because there are significant network benefits with digital money and assets, market infrastructures that are early in gaining scale might later be hard to disrupt. A variety of network designs have emerged, ranging from open, permissionless networks that defy national borders to tightly controlled ones, each one with different economics. Senior executives should understand the motivation, opportunities, and challenges for each design.Closed (permissioned) networksimpose limitations on who can access and manage the network. Financial institutions have used this option in digital asset experiments because it aligns closely with their existing business model as regulated providers of financial services. It also has greater policy support given the greater level of control and the ability to rely on existing approaches to manage risk and compliance. For example, the BIS advocates this approach in its vision of a unified global ledger.This type of network could be the least disruptive to the financial industry, while also leading to a reshuffling within the industry if some banks are slow to adapt. However, if only a few banks and participants join, it could make it harder for any network to scale up and develop a rich digital assets ecosystem.By contrast, inopen (permissionless) networks, participation is limited only by economic realities. This is the approach used by most crypto networks today. Given the challenges with enforcing compliance and regulation when there are no restrictions on access and usage, many in the industry are looking to build a \\u201ctrust layer\\u201d to ensure transactions take place only among verified participants. Banks that have issued digital bonds and stablecoins on public networks have followed this approach. Project Guardian by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was an example of experimentation by the public sector. As discussed inour paper on the project, broader industry efforts are needed to scale this solution, including the creation of legal clarity, standards, and guardrails. A trust layer could enable digital natives to launchinnovative new services in lending, origination, and financing in a manner that gains policy support.Emerging Use CasesThe future of money is highly unlikely to be monochrome, with every sector adopting the same instruments, technology designs, and business models. Instead, it will grow use case by use case, driven by preferences and decisions made across business segments and geographies. The future will likely combine elements of some or all of the four paradigms. Here, we look at how these factors might play out among some of the most likely competitors across three major use cases \\u2013 cross-border payments, asset settlement, and domestic retail payments.Cross-border paymentsSending money from one country to another can be a costly and prolonged process.Our joint papershowed that corporates move more than $23 trillion across borders each year and incur roughly $120 billion in transaction costs. A common digital platform linking national CBDCs to enable real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments could slash corporate transaction costs by more than 80%, or $100 billion a year.Over 30 countries have already started experimenting with using CBDCs for cross-border payments. In a pilot project with the BIS, the central banks of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates showed that digital ledger technology could execute trades between the four parties\\u2019 digital currencies in seconds and reduce costs as much as 50% by cutting out correspondent banks and streamlining liquidity management. Meanwhile, new market infrastructures and business models are emerging. Banks have launched consortia that use blockchain technology for multi-currency FX net settlement and for payment-versus-payment capability. New stablecoins are emerging pegged to new currencies, with MiCA providing regulatory clarity for euro-pegged stablecoins. The cross-border opportunity is vast but the challenge facing all innovators is the need for coordination, harmonization, and interoperability between so many jurisdictions and technology platforms.Asset settlementTraditional asset settlement, while largely electronic, is still costly, time-consuming, and complicated. Processes are fragmented by asset classes and jurisdictions, with limited standardization. Digital money could introduce some greater efficiencies, but it would require the widespread tokenization of a range of assets to reap the full benefits of settling trades in CBDCs or stablecoins or tokenized deposits. We are far from that point, with total digital bond issuance amounting to just $1.5 billion currently, a tiny fraction of the $127 trillion global fixed-income market.Digital payment solutions could enable a variety of technology firms to compete with global custodians that have traditionally dominated this space. Institutional DeFi protocols can automate financial transactions and provide a more decentralized and secure way of settling assets and automating risk-management practices. Real-time settlement based on delivery versus payment can reduce the risk of counterparty default and free up capital for other purposes. Banks, custodians, and other traditional intermediaries will need to adapt quickly to harness these changes. Estimates on the expected size of tokenized asset markets vary widely, but there could be reinforcing benefits to redesigning both asset forms and the money that\\u2019s used to settle transactions, which would accelerate the rate of change.Retail domestic paymentsCentral bank digital currencies will be a big wild card in retail payments, with roughly 100 jurisdictions around the world exploring the issuance of CBDCs or having already done so. Few CBDC projects make use of DLT, while many leave the development of new payment features to the private sector. This could unleash competition between the firms that dominate payments today and blockchain-native innovators offering new value-added services based on programmable smart contracts or loyalty features like rewards programs. Stablecoin issuers are already looking to apply their technology to real-world retail payments. Open infrastructures that allow users to exercise more control over their data, an integral part of web3 ecosystems, could gain favor with consumers.The paradigms presented in this paper can help banks, businesses, and policymakers as they consider their next steps, but they aren\\u2019t mutually exclusive.We are likely to see some if not all of these types of money coexist and play a growing role, depending on whether they are being used for retail transactions at the corner store or to finance multi-billion-dollar cross-border trade deals or investments. In subsequent papers, we will explore these different use cases in much more detail, and we will examine how the paradigms could play out under different scenarios and what industry leaders should be doingtoday.AuthorsLarissa de Lima,Jason EkbergandDouglas J.

Unlike traditional money,CBDCsoffer a digital alternative that is both backed and issued by national central banks, combining the benefits of digital transactions with the stability of government-backed currency. Understanding the depth and breadth ofCBDCsis crucial for financial experts navigating the future of finance.The Evolution of Money and Introduction of CBDCsMoney has seen significant transformations over the centuries, evolving from barter systems to banknotes and now to digital banking.CBDCsrepresent the next step, aiming to modernize financial services to be more resilient and inclusive. Central banks like theEuropean Central Bankand theFederal Reserveare exploringCBDCsto stay at the forefront of technological innovation while safeguarding monetary sovereignty.Technological UnderpinningsCBDCsare digital currencies issued by central banks that hold legal tender status, bridging the gap between digital and physical economies. While some countries opt for blockchain technology to leverage decentralization, transparency, and security, others prefer a centralized approach to maintain tighter control. Key technological considerations forCBDCsinclude:Scalability:Ensuring the system can handle large volumes of transactions.Security:Implementing robust defenses against cyber threats and fraud.Interoperability:Facilitating seamless integration with existing financial technologies.Privacy:Balancing transparency with individual rights to privacy.Worldwide Implementation EffortsDifferent nations have taken unique approaches to deployingCBDCs, reflecting their diverse economic contexts and objectives:Sweden\\u2019s E-krona:Developed in response to dwindling cash usage, aiming to secure public access to trusted money in a digital format.China\\u2019s Digital Yuan:Part of a broader initiative to increase China\\u2019s influence in the global financial system.Eastern Caribbean\\u2019s DCash:Implemented to improve financial accessibility and resilience in a region prone to natural disasters.Advantages of CBDCsCBDCsoffer numerous advantages, including:Efficiency:Streamlining payments and settlements, enhancing economic activity and reducing transaction costs.Financial Inclusion:Providing a gateway for financial services to populations typically outside the banking system.Reduced Operational Costs:Digital formats decrease costs related to printing, distributing, and securing physical currency.Monetary Sovereignty:Helping countries assert control over their monetary systems.Stability:Offering a secure alternative to private digital currencies and volatile cryptocurrencies.Economic and Market ImplicationsThe implementation ofCBDCscould significantly impact monetary policy and financial stability. By providing central banks with a new tool for conducting monetary policy,CBDCscould enhance control over the money supply and interest rates. They may also influence the banking system by providing individuals with direct access to the central bank\\u2019s resources, potentially reducing transaction costs and increasing speed.CBDCscarry significant implications for the global financial marketplace, including:Banking Sector Dynamics:With the potential to hold funds directly with the central bank, consumers might chooseCBDCsover traditional bank deposits.International Trade:Facilitating easier and cheaper cross-border transactions, potentially reshaping economic engagement.Innovation and Competition:Spurring innovation within the private sector, pushing financial institutions to enhance their service offerings.Despite the potential benefits,CBDCsraise significant issues, particularly regarding privacy and data security. Ensuring aCBDCsystem is secure against cyberattacks while maintaining user privacy is a complex challenge.Regulatory and Policy FrameworksThe successful rollout ofCBDCswill require comprehensiveregulatory frameworksto address potential risks and ensure smooth operation. These frameworks need to tackle issues related to cybersecurity, privacy, legal tender status, and international cooperation.\\n\\nAs digital currencies become more integrated into the global financial system, they may offer a more inclusive and efficient financial framework but will require careful implementation to balance innovation with stability.CBDCspresent a profound opportunity to enhance financial transactions, promoting greater efficiency, inclusivity, and stability. However, their successful integration demands careful consideration of technological choices, impact assessments on existing financial structures, and robust regulatory measures.The information provided here is not investment, tax, or financial advice.

According to the latest data from Money\\u2019s daily rate survey, borrowers seeking a30-year fixed-rate purchase loanfound rates averaging6.711%. Meanwhile, the30-year refinance rateis averaging slightly higher at6.814%.Freddie Mac reported a notable rise in the average rate for a30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which jumped to6.32%, marking an increase of0.20 percentage pointsfrom the previous week. Similarly, the15-year fixed-rate mortgagesaw an uptick, averaging5.41%, with a0.16 percentage pointincrease.Despite these increases,mortgage ratesremain nearly a full percentage point lower than the year\\u2019s high of7.22%. This trend reflects the largest week-over-week increase since last April. In a press release, Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\\u2019s chief economist, emphasized that while higher rates present challenges for prospective buyers, the underlying strength of the U.S. economy \\u201cshould continue to support the recovery of the housing market.\\u201dFor those navigating thecurrent mortgage landscape, it\\u2019s crucial to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders. Money\\u2019s list of theBest Mortgage Lendersand theBest Mortgage Refinance Companiescan provide a starting point for finding competitive rates. Additionally, utilizing Money\\u2019smortgage calculatorcan help borrowers estimate their monthly payments under different rate scenarios.Understanding Mortgage Rate TrendsThe recent rise inmortgage ratesis partly attributed to last week\\u2019s better-than-expected jobs report, which sent yields on10-year Treasury bondshigher, subsequently pulling mortgage rates up as well. As more economic data emerges, prospective buyers should brace for continued volatility in the near term.When consideringmortgage options, it\\u2019s essential to understand the differences betweenfixed-rateandadjustable-rate mortgages. Fixed-rate loans offer stability with a consistent interest rate throughout the loan\\u2019s duration, while adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) begin with a fixed rate that later adjusts at regular intervals.Factors Influencing Mortgage RatesLoan Term:Longer loans typically have smaller payments but may cost more overall.Loan Type:Fixed-rate loans offer steady payments, while ARMs adjust periodically.Economic Factors:Rates are influenced by the federal funds rate, Treasury yields, and borrower qualifications.For those contemplating refinancing, it\\u2019s crucial to weigh the pros and cons, asrefinance ratestend to be higher. Resources like theIs Now a Good Time to Refinanceguide can help homeowners make informed decisions.Securing the Best Mortgage RateTo secure thebest mortgage rate, shopping around is key. Freddie Mac suggests that obtaining rate quotes from multiple lenders can lead to significant savings over the life of the loan. Additionally, buyingdiscount pointscan lower the interest rate, offering further savings. More details on this can be found in theDiscount Pointsguide.For those with higher-than-average rates, improving credit scores and exploring multiple lender options can help lower offers.

Here\\u2019s a detailed look at the anticipated trends and changes.2025 ForecastThehousing market in 2025is expected to see a slight rise inhome prices, projected to be between 1% and 2% above current inflation rates. This growth is anticipated due to increased real incomes and lower mortgage rates, which will enhance affordability. As millennials reach their prime home-buying age, demand is expected to rise, with new constructions attempting to mitigate the ongoing inventory shortage. Despite improvements, underbuilding will continue to affect market dynamics.2026 OutlookIn 2026, more buyers are likely to collaborate with family and friends to manage high housing costs. Emerging technologies are set to revolutionizehome construction, making it faster and more cost-efficient. Builders will be urged to consider the rising costs associated withclimate change, focusing on sustainability and resilience in new developments.2027 ExpectationsLooking towards 2027, demographic trends such as urbanization and shifts in worker preferences due to remote work will influencemarket demand. Interest rates are expected to stabilize, potentially settling between 5.5% and 7%, impactingmortgage affordability. An increase in housing demand in suburban and rural areas is anticipated as people seek more space and community amenities.2028 ProjectionsBy 2028, the rise inhousing inventorymay return the market to a more balanced state, with supply meeting demand. This balance could ease competition in local markets, particularly in fast-growing Southern cities. However,housing affordabilitywill continue to pose challenges, especially in densely populated urban centers.2029 VisionApproaching 2029, gradual changes in economic conditions, technological advances, and demographic shifts are expected to shape thehousing landscape. As Millennials and Gen Z dominate the buying market, preferences will shift towards environmentally friendly, affordable housing solutions.

These laws, approved by Governor Ron DeSantis, are designed to enhance affordability and protection for residents, touching on various aspects of the real estate industry.Boosting Housing ProgramsAt the forefront is theHometown Heroes Housing Program (SB 328), which sees an additional $100 million allocated to aid first-time homebuyers, particularly those in essential service roles such as teachers and healthcare workers. This initiative aligns with previous efforts to stimulate private investment in affordable housing, providing necessary guidance on local zoning and density regulations. Realtors are encouraged to direct clients to theHometown Heroes Program.In a similar vein, theMy Safe Florida Home Program (SB 7028)receives a $200 million boost, aimed at empowering homeowners to fortify their homes against severe weather, thereby reducing insurance costs. The program now includes free inspections and grants up to $10,000 for low-income homeowners without the need for matching funds. More details can be foundhere.Expanding Protection to CondosTheMy Safe Florida Condominium Pilot Program (HB 1029)extends these protective measures to coastal condominiums, with $30 million dedicated to strengthening roofs and openings against storms.

These measures aim to alleviate financial pressures on homeowners.Environmental efforts are bolstered with over $1.2 billion allocated for water quality initiatives, including Everglades restoration and mitigation of harmful algal blooms.Looking AheadFuture legislation includes increased transparency in condominium and homeowners\\u2019 association documents, with requirements for digital accessibility. Upcoming laws will also mandate seller flood disclosures and digital record-keeping for homeowner associations, with phased implementation over the next few years.These legislative changes, as highlighted in theoriginal article, reflect a proactive approach by Florida\\u2019s legislative assembly and Florida Realtors to address critical housing and environmental issues, promising widespread benefits for Floridians.Read More1310, 2024Opportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesGalleryOpportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesArticle,Housing Market,Mortgage RatesOpportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-13T23:48:49-04:00October 13, 2024|Categories:Article,Housing Market,Mortgage Rates|Tags:Home Buying,Real Estate|0 CommentsAfter weeks of steady declines,mortgage rateshave finally reached a range that brings the dream of homeownership closer for many hopeful buyers. This shift suggests potential relief in the inflated housing market, offering buyers increased purchasing power despite ongoing high home prices. Experts indicate that the current conditions could favor those looking to enter the housing market before potential demand surges occur once again.Although home prices continue to break records, price growth is slowing due to loosening inventory and sluggish demand. Buyers are gaining leverage when negotiating with sellers, creating a window of opportunity for those ready to make a move.Despite the positive trend inmortgage rates, many potential buyers remain cautious, waiting for further Federal Reserve rate cuts that could lead to even lower mortgage rates. However, experts warn that waiting too long could result in missing out on favorable market conditions. Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, suggests that lower rates this fall could coincide with slower home price growth as more sellers enter the market and inventory rises.Housing Market Forecast for 2024 and 2025The U.S. housing market continues to be a hot topic, withhome pricesposting a 5% annual gain according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index. While this is a slowdown from June\\u2019s 5.5% gain, home prices remain at record highs, making affordability a challenge for many.Ralph McLaughlin, senior economist at Realtor.com, echoes the sentiment that home price growth will slow before rebounding. He notes that withmortgage ratesfalling to 24-month lows and a high probability of further rate reductions, home price growth could bottom out before reaccelerating as buyer purchasing power improves.Can We Expect a Housing Market Recovery in 2025?For a housing recovery to take place, several conditions need to unfold. Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH.com, suggests that inventories of homes for sale must increase significantly to ease upward pressure on prices. The recent decline inmortgage ratesis beginning to help loosen inventory, albeit gradually.After peaking at 7.79% in October 2023, the average 30-year fixedmortgage ratehas been below 6.5% since mid-August, landing at 6.12% the week ending October 3. This trend, coupled with the Federal Reserve\\u2019s recent rate cut, offers a glimmer of hope for potential buyers.NAR Practice Changes: What Buyers and Sellers Need To KnowIn a landmark settlement, theNational Association of Realtors (NAR)agreed to pay $418 million to settle antitrust lawsuits, leading to new rules that promote a more transparent home-buying process. These changes, effective since August 17, aim to benefit both consumers and agents by clarifying the financial aspects of real estate transactions.For decades, it was standard practice for home sellers to cover the buyer\\u2019s broker commission, but now buyers must enter into written agreements with agents before touring homes. Buyers can negotiate commission payments, adding a new layer of complexity to the transaction process.How Will the New Rules Impact Affordability?With buyers more likely to be responsible for paying broker commissions, affordability concerns arise. Matt Side from Realty ONE Group Eclipse notes that buyers with fewer resources could be particularly affected. However, he advises that sellers will continue to offer compensation to buyer representatives to increase demand for their homes.Housing Inventory Forecast: When Will There Be Sufficient Supply To Reduce Prices?Despite more resale and new homes entering the market, inventory remains well below pre-Covid averages. Many homeowners are \\u201clocked in\\u201d at ultra-low mortgage rates, unwilling to exchange for higher rates in a high-priced market, leading to demand outpacing supply.Rick Sharga, founder and CEO of CJ Patrick Company, suggests that a meaningful increase in supply won\\u2019t occur untilmortgage ratesreturn to the low 5% range, likely not in 2024. However, declining rates could loosen the lock-in effect, providing some much-needed housing supply.Will the Housing Market Crash in 2025?Concerns about a housing market crash akin to 2008 are prevalent, but experts like Tom Hutchens from Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions believe the record-low supply of houses protects against such a scenario. Today\\u2019s homeowners are on more secure footing, with many having substantial home equity.Jess Schulman from Bluebird Lending agrees, noting that further Fed rate cuts could lead to more transactions and potential home price increases due to pent-up demand.Will 2024 or 2025 Be Better to Buy a Home?Buying a house is a highly personal decision, and while predicting future market conditions is challenging, experts advise against waiting for the perfect moment. Orphe Divounguy from Zillow Home Loans suggests that the best time to buy is when you find a home that meets your needs and budget.Keith Gumbinger concurs, warning that waiting for better conditions may not be the best strategy, as home prices generally keep rising, moving the goalposts for amassing a down payment.In conclusion, while the housing market presents challenges, there are opportunities for those ready to navigate the complexities. Asmortgage ratesdecline and home prices stabilize, potential buyers and sellers must stay informed and prepared to make the most of the evolving landscape.Read More1310, 2024The $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkGalleryThe $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkArticle,Real Estate,Remote WorkThe $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-13T22:48:34-04:00October 13, 2024|Categories:Article,Real Estate,Remote Work|Tags:housing market,Secondary Cities|0 CommentsIn the ever-evolving landscape ofreal estate, the nationalhousing markethas reached a staggering valuation of $47.5 trillion, marking a $2.4 trillion increase over the past year. This remarkable growth, as highlighted in apreliminary Redfin analysis, underscores the profound impact ofremote workon housing trends.Remote Work and Secondary CitiesA key driver of this surge is the allure ofremote work, which has reshaped the demand for housing in specific metropolitan areas. More affordable cities, often referred to as \\u201csecondary cities,\\u201d have emerged as significant beneficiaries. For instance, Newark, New Jersey, and New Haven, Connecticut, experienced notable increases in home values, with Newark\\u2019shousing marketskyrocketing by 12.8% over the last year. This trend is largely due to their proximity to larger urban centers and their appeal to those priced out of expensive metros like New York.The Subcity PhenomenonThe concept of a \\u201csubcity,\\u201d as described in acolloquial definition, plays a crucial role in this dynamic. These are cities that function as secondary hubs to larger metropolitan areas. With theremote worktrend solidifying into a hybrid model, thesesubcitieshave become attractive alternatives, offering affordability and accessibility.Winners and Losers in the Housing MarketWhilesecondary citiesflourish, traditional boomtowns and high-cost areas have faced stagnation or decline. Cities like Boise, Idaho, and New York City saw declines in home values, attributed to their already high prices or pandemic-fueled influxes that have since waned. Meanwhile, suburban and rural areas have also seen growth, with suburban home values rising by 5.6% to about $29 trillion.Challenges for Prospective BuyersDespite the overall market growth, prospective buyers face significant challenges. Elevated mortgage rates, limited inventory, and high home prices have made homeownership increasingly unaffordable. Asreported by Fortune, thehousing marketexperienced a freeze, with existing home sales plummeting to their lowest point in nearly three decades.However, there is a silver lining. Experts anticipate that mortgage rates may start to decline before the end of 2024, potentially easing affordability concerns. Until then, homeowners continue to hold substantial housing wealth, benefiting from the supply shortage that maintains elevated home values.ConclusionAs thehousing marketcontinues to evolve, the interplay betweenremote work,secondary cities, and economic factors will remain pivotal.

If the trend of declining high inflation continues, it could align with the Federal Reserve\\u2019s targets, leading to reduced volatility in mortgage rates.

This increase will be driven by factors such as the rise in real incomes, lower mortgage rates, and increased affordability. However, it may take time to reach the home value heights of mid-2022.The trend of buyers pooling resources with friends and family to purchase homes is expected to continue, as the rising cost of housing drives people to seek more space and privacy.

According toEducationData.org\\u2019s 2023 report, the average federal student loan borrower owes $37,574, while private borrowers face an even steeper average of $54,921. With these daunting figures, many are considering unconventional methods to ease their financial burden.Contact Your LenderFor those with private loans, reaching out to your lender can reveal whether credit card payments are an option. While not all lenders offer this flexibility, some do, providing a possible avenue for managing payments more conveniently.Utilize Third-Party Payment PlatformsFederal student loan borrowers might consider third-party platforms likePaySimplyandPlastiq. These services enable payments via credit card by converting them into wire transfers or cash equivalents, although fees ranging from 2.5% to 3% can offset any potential rewards benefits.Consider a Balance TransferFor those nearing the end of their loan term, transferring the balance to a0% APR balance transfer credit cardcould be a viable option. This method can provide an interest-free period of up to 21 months, though it comes with a transfer fee of 2% to 3%.Creative BudgetingA strategic approach involves reallocating expenses. For example, paying for groceries with a credit card can free up cash for student loan payments, achieving the same financial effect without direct loan charges.Cash AdvancesWhile not ideal due to highAPRrates and immediate interest accrual, cash advances can be a last-resort option. Borrowers should weigh the costs carefully before proceeding.Explore Deferment and ForbearanceFederal loan holders should exploredeferment and forbearanceoptions, which offer payment relief without credit damage. Private lenders may also provide hardship plans, though these vary by institution.While these strategies can provide temporary relief, borrowers must remain vigilant about the potential pitfalls, such as high interest rates and the risk of accumulating more debt.

As part of this exploration, central banks are carefully considering the feasibility of retail CBDCs[2]References to CBDCs in this paper are referring to retail CBDCs unless otherwise specified.as they continually strive to strengthen and grow their economies with greater innovation and efficiency. To do this, they will necessarily have to engage an ecosystem of participating banks, payment service providers, data service providers, payment networks, and a variety of technology resources. Collectively, it will be critical that there is active public-private collaboration to consider the impact that CBDCs may have on the future of payments and how best to safeguard the interests of consumers and businesses.Exploring the promise of new technology and the potential efficiency gains that adoption could bring has been an essential part of the modernisation journey. Innovative new solutions have been the drivers for sustainable and inclusive economic growth that benefit everyone, everywhere. However, the success of innovative payment solutions has always been contingent on whether they fundamentally address any perceived gaps in the market that existing solutions and services do not already adequately serve. It also depends on whether consumers and businesses believe that new payment innovations are superior to the (digital) solutions already available.Importantly in case of CBDCs, it will also be contingent on who is best placed to provide this innovation. Unlike commercial payment solutions offered today, retail CBDCs raise the more fundamental questions of whether central banks should be in the business of providing retail payments to customers and the broader implications this may have on competition. There are also problematic assumptions made in relation to retail CBDCs that relate to their need to mimic cash-like convenience, which has a direct impact on business models, distorting market dynamics and risking instability.This paper challenges the motivations and the assumptions made by central banks on how retail CBDCs would be delivered under so-called \\u201ctwo-tier\\u201d intermediated models. Section 1 explores the motivations outlined by central banks, and questions whether retail CBDCs are intended to act as \\u201cmonetary anchors\\u201d for stability or, whether they are instead being designed as central bank-led market solutions. Section 2 then discusses the notion that a retail CBDC would be delivered under a two-tier intermediated model, highlighting the vast gaps between how the roles of industry participants for retail CBDCs are envisaged and how the current intermediated financial system operates today. Section 3 then delves into the commercial model for delivering a retail CBDC, which for many central banks, is expected to be offered free of charge to customers just like their cash equivalents. The paper concludes with the principles that will be needed for CBDCs to successfully address user needs, and importantly how the market can help deliver and distribute CBDCs.Central bank digital currencies: Monetary anchor or market solution?Today, there are 134 countries & currency unions, representing 98 per cent of global GDP, exploring both wholesale and retail CBDCs.[3]See the Atlantic Council\\u2019s CBDC Tracker athttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/Central banks\\u2019 motivations for exploring CBDCs vary across jurisdictions. Key goals often cited by central banks include creating a digital substitute for cash in an increasingly digital society, improving control over monetary policy, achieving geopolitical and strategic autonomy, enhancing resilience, increasing the speed of payments, reducing their cost, and facilitating financial inclusion. Above all, central banks want to ensure that central bank money remains an anchor of monetary and financial stability.[4]There are numerous references made by central banks that CBDCs would reinforce central bank money as the anchor of the monetary system, as well as acting as an anchor of financial stability. For \\u2026Continue readingDesign choices for the successful rollout of any new product will always place the needs of end-users at the centre of solution development. Ultimately, CBDCs will only meet their broader policy and systemic objectives if users believe that their value improves on, and is superior to, existing market solutions and there is widespread adoption. To determine whether CBDCs ultimately meet their objectives will therefore require central banks to clearly articulate the economic or market problem that exists in today\\u2019s payment system, how the CBDC addresses or solves this problem and what \\u201csuccess\\u201d looks like. This should be based on use cases that are informed by market assessments of current and future payment needs. This means that user segments are clearly identified, the value-added benefits of the CBDC are clearly understood by all parties in the payments ecosystem and that existing payment infrastructure and technical know-how are leveraged to help rollout and delivery.However, as is the case for many CBDC initiatives around the world, the motivations expressed by central banks are predominantly focused on policy and systemic objectives, rather than being primarily driven by specific customer needs, requirements or benefits.Macroeconomic, financial policy and international considerations will likely fail to resonate with end-users who \\u2013 particularly in highly advanced payments systems \\u2013 already have fast, safe and efficient ways to make everyday payments. Paradoxically, if CBDCs are also overwhelmingly successful and achieve substantial adoption and usage, this may mean that they have displaced other types of payment instruments and deposit accounts, materializing the risks of disintermediation, deposit substitution and financial instability. In such a scenario, \\u201csuccess\\u201d may also mean that central bank money no longer acts as an anchor of monetary and financial stability, but rather becomes the cause of market disruption and instability.Currently, the design choices being explored for many retail CBDC projects replicate payment features and functionalities already offered by the private sector. They are based on the delivery of a means to hold and fund retail payments in CBDC (e.g., digital wallets), the infrastructure needed to enable those CBDC payments (e.g., online, point of sale and offline capabilities) and finally, a scheme (e.g., like the ones operated by domestic and international card networks and digital public infrastructure). While the underlying value being transferred with a CBDC is a central bank liability rather than a commercial bank liability, this distinction is largely inconsequential for the average consumer. The form factors needed will also be indistinguishable from current retail payment products.It will be critical therefore that the intended benefits of CBDCs over existing payment solutions in terms of their novel application be clearly articulated to users. To ensure its longer- term viability, central banks should also outline the incremental value that CBDCs create that exceed the significant costs associated with their development, delivery, and operation. Market participants will find it challenging to invest in new infrastructure unless there is a strong commercial business use case for doing so. Above all, CBDCs should avoid replicating market solutions in pursuit of domestic, geopolitical or macro-financial policy goals when highly advanced market solutions already exist. To do so could cause competitive distortions and inadvertently threaten the efficiencies that already exist in today\\u2019s highly evolved payments systems. It remains to be seen whether it is the role of the central bank to be direct providers of digital retail payments.Instead, central banks can ensure that central bank money remains a monetary anchor by \\u201cdoing what only central banks can do\\u201d[5]In the House of Lords debate on the Economic Affairs Committee\\u2019s Report, Lord King of Lothbury cautioned against expanding the Bank of England\\u2019s responsibilities with a retail CBDC, noting that \\u2026Continue reading). Central banks are important regulators of payment systems and they are there to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial system. Central banks are pivotal for providing the necessary regulatory framework to foster safe innovation and supporting market innovation, e.g., in the nascent form of commercial bank tokenised deposits, which could play an important role in driving new payment solutions for the future digital money landscape (Oliver Wyman and JP Morgan, 2022). Importantly, tokenised central bank reserves in the form of wholesale CBDCs, together with tokenised deposits, would maintain the strong two-tier monetary system and provide the necessary monetary anchor to ensure the \\u201csingleness of money\\u201d in an evolving digital payments age (BIS, 2023).Delivering digital public money: the \\u201ctwo-tier\\u201d distribution model and interoperabilityCentral bank proposals for CBDCs recognise that digital innovation in payments is best served under a public-private partnership, which is critical to ensuring an open and competitive payment ecosystem. This approach is aligned with the existing allocation of public and private responsibilities within the financial system, and by extending a broader set of capabilities to the private sector, it would also provide a more robust platform for the development of value-added innovations. In the context therefore for CBDCs, a truly intermediated retail CBDC model could provide a secure, fast, and resilient technology environment that avoids the unnecessary expense of parallel infrastructure and ensures that compliance requirements remain primarily with industry. This approach also ensures that the central bank retains institutional governance over core monetary infrastructure, while relying on private sector competition to drive innovation, efficiency, and a diversity of offerings.Importantly, in a well-designed two-tier approach, intermediaries would continue to play a critical role in creating trust, meeting the needs of users, and enabling the successful adoption of a CBDC. As is the case for the current ecosystem, a two-tier model is based on the central bank issuing the currency and relying on market intermediaries to determine the modalities of distribution. These intermediaries then compete to attract customers through better and more efficient products and services and develop these based on market dynamics and commercial considerations. Therefore, if the CBDC intends to promote choice and competition in a two-tier model, the modalities of distribution and acceptance should be left to intermediaries and merchants and be based on market and commercial considerations rather than regulatory solutions.Intermediated models for distributing retail CBDCs nevertheless appear to fall short of such an arrangement in emerging retail CBDC proposals. Two-tier models, such as the ones that are being considered in Europe, require intermediaries to fulfil the role as distribution agents on behalf of the central bank, which are required to carry out these functions based on legislative mandates. This means that intermediaries do not necessarily exercise agency over whether they distribute and how they can offer CBDC products based on commercial considerations. Similarly, they will not be given the freedom to choose the means through which they would be able to distribute retail CBDCs. While interoperability is cited as a key objective for CBDCs, emerging proposals seem to indicate that they would need to be distributed using only central bank run-payment rails, operating separately under their own scheme.[6]See the Digital euro packagehttps://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/digital-euro-package_enA CBDC has the potential to serve as a foundation for innovative and value-added financial products and services developed by competitors within the private sector if there is agenuine desire for a CBDC to act as a digital version of central bank money. Open and competitive payment ecosystems are critical to enabling access, adoption, and use of payment options that serve a wide range of user needs, preferences, and financial inclusion. Moreover, ongoing payments innovation and the efficiency of national and international payment flows all depend on CBDCs being interoperable with existing payment schemes to ensure seamless consumer adoption, avoid siloed ecosystems and monetary fragmentation. For a CBDC, interoperability with other stores of value (e.g., commercial bank deposits, e-money etc.) would play an important role in strengthening the domestic payment ecosystem and reinforcing the role of central bank money at its core. Sustained collaboration between the central bank and private sector participants will be critical to delivering this interoperability.A CBDC must be usable for a variety of in-person and digital transactions to provide value as a payment mechanism. However, enabling acceptance points is a prominent challenge to driving mass adoption of any new payment solution. Consumers will be more likely to adopt a CBDC if it can be used on existing acceptance infrastructure and is supported by known and identifiable payment form factors (physical and remote) linked to the user\\u2019s existing devices and accounts. Requiring CBDCs to employ new payment rails would on the other hand create artificial barriers between the CBDC and commercial bank money, causing unnecessary friction between payment means and overcomplicate access and distribution. This would generate confusion and ultimately go against the ambition of an integrated payment market.Proposals that seek to mandate acceptance and impose regulatory models of distribution call into question a true two-tier model, which could result in unintended market fragmentation with implications for competition, stability, security, and innovation within the broader payment system. CBDCs will be more competitive, innovative, resilient, and better equipped to meet various policy objectives, as well as the evolving demands of the consumer, where the project works to actively encourage the participation of all payments market stakeholders. A \\u2018two-tier\\u2019 model that is based on market-led innovation is best placed to provide a secure, fast, and resilient technology environment that avoids the unnecessary expense of parallel infrastructure and ensures resilience.Ensuring a sustainable and competitive payment ecosystemMany central banks envisage CBDCs to operate functionally as a version of \\u201cdigital cash\\u201d. This logic assumes that cash has characteristics that can be easily replicated by a digital equivalent. At a minimum, this means that users should have access to CBDCs at no additional cost, that it should be available at any time \\u2013 with or without internet connectivity \\u2013, be accepted as a means to purchase goods and services and to be able to exchange it peer to peer. Importantly, it should also be available to everyone, to ensure inclusion and equity.However, unlike the relatively simple infrastructure that is needed to print and distribute cash, building new wallet solutions, integrating with new payment infrastructure, developing offline solutions, and enabling the various links in the payment value chain are all costly andcomplex activities. Sustainable digital payment ecosystems are dependent on a delicate balancing of incentives between those stakeholders who bear the costs of enabling payments and those who benefit from payment services. For a central bank\\u2019s CBDC infrastructure to sustain a vibrant and competitive ecosystem of payments innovators, incentives will need to exist that allow payment service providers to generate an appropriate return on their investments.Compensation models therefore need to consider the potentially significant new implementation and running costs that merchants and intermediaries will need to incur to offer CBDC services. These include, but not limited to, adapting front and backend systems, customer onboarding processes, operational and other security upgrades. Many central banks are also discussing the possibility that CBDCs could run on entirely new technology, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT). Others are also considering the need to adopt state-of-the- art privacy enhancing technologies, which are promising but have yet to be run and operated at scale. Accordingly, compensation models also need to factor in the feasibility for industry to adopt such new technologies. New teams of expertise would be needed with detailed knowledge of this new technology over the lifecycle of their development, leading to potentially high operational costs and excessive complexity for some payment intermediaries.Thought should also be given to how well existing regulation is equipped to address downstream applications of a CBDC via new technologies. Regulatory guidance in this area would be essential to help participants apply existing rules to innovative payment services involving a CBDC according to whatever technological form it is designed to function. For example, if parallel DLT infrastructure is required to support a CBDC that will function offline\\u2013 consideration will need to be given to any additional regulatory requirements applicable to the use of this technology.Another key area of risk that is often given limited consideration is the enormous complexity and costs of mitigating fraud and cyber-risk across a retail CBDC ecosystem. The cost to the global economy of cybercrime is expected to grow by 15 percent per year over the next five years, reaching $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025.8 A retail CBDC will inevitably face sophisticated fraud and cyberattacks from both private and state-sponsored actors. CBDC users must trust that the system will be accessible and operational where and when it is needed; that their funds, accounts, identity, and other data are secure; and that they will be protected in the event of fraud.Importantly, unlike commercial means of payment, end users will hold the CBDC to a much higher standard given that it will be compared to its closest equivalent \\u2013 the physical banknote. Users will also assume that as it is issued and backed by the central bank (often cited as the key benefit of a CBDC) it would be more secure than commercial alternatives. Should the CBDC therefore suffer from any vulnerability due to weak end-points, the underlying credibility of the CBDC and implicitly the central bank may be impacted as a result.The premise of CBDC innovation and scalability is built on the ability of intermediaries to offer consumers new digital services to enhance the convenience and utility of their CBDC accounts. If the cost to intermediaries and service providers for the provision of the CBDC is greater than a comparable digital means of payment, industry will not be incentivized to provide high-quality CBDC services, which may affect the success of the CBDC. The same competitive conditions should therefore be applied to CBDC and comparable payment services. Likewise, if central banks propose mandatory acceptance, intermediaries and merchants must not be constrained by regulated levels of compensation or, the payment rails through which they distribute and accept a CBDC. Instead, they should be given the choice to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective way to recuperate the costs being imposed as well as deliver commercially viable solutions to their customers.From a business perspective, while merchants are applauding CBDC initiatives in the hope of reduced costs, CBDCs risk disintermediating banks in the distribution of money and constraining existing private payment solutions. The risk of endangering competition and innovation due to excessive central bank\\u2019s intervention is high. This is why it is crucial to strike the right balance between public intervention and private sector initiative in regulating CBDCs. Above all, a CBDC should be financially self-sustaining, i.e., operate without any public subsidies on investment or operational costs. Otherwise, there is a risk that the CBDC will have the unintended consequences of reducing the diversity, competitiveness, and resilience in the payment landscape.Conclusion: principles for an open, competitive, and innovative payment market using CBDCsIt is essential that governments and central banks adopt specific measures to ensure an open, competitive, and innovative payment market using CBDCs. These actions should focus on creating a level-playing field for all payment solutions, encouraging private sector participation, and fostering technological advancements. By doing so, central banks can support a dynamic financial ecosystem where multiple payment methods coexist and compete, ultimately benefiting consumers through increased choice and improved services. By focusing on ensuring a well-functioning market, central banks can drive improvements in efficiency, innovation, and service quality to the benefit of consumers and thereby remaining an anchor for monetary and financial stability.While the motivations driving central banks to explore CBDCs differ, there remains a common set of principles that all CBDC initiatives should support. These tenets will best serve the needs of consumers, preserve the health of the financial system, and ensure that consumers continue to have access to a robust and innovative array of payment options (McWaters, 2024).Promote Mutual Trust and a Global Approach to Payments.Encouraging a global regulatory framework that supports multilateral initiatives ensures that sovereignty and geopolitical goals do not create barriers to competition and investment. Strengthening the elationship between jurisdictions is essential to prevent race-to-the-bottom scenarios where national champions are favored over foreign competition. This collaborative approach will uphold the commitment of advanced economies to an open free market economy. CBDCs should be designed to integrate with existing payment solutions, promoting unity rather than exclusion in the global payments landscape.Foster Genuine Public-Private Cooperation.Establishing open and ongoing dialogue between regulators and private market participants ensures that CBDC projects are aligned with market needs and have the best chance of success. Clearly delineating the roles and responsibilities of the central bank and private entities ensures that the central bank does not encroach on market activities that are more efficiently managed by private parties. Private sector innovation can be encouraged by avoiding overly prescriptive, top-down regulation that may stifle creativity and adaptability. This collaborative approach will leverage the strengths of both public and private sectors, fostering a dynamic and innovative payment ecosystem.Ensure a Level-Playing Field.Implementing regulations that allow CBDCs and private payment solutions to compete on fair terms will ensure a level playing field. This includes avoiding undue advantages for CBDCs from both a business and regulatory perspective. To achieve this the following guidelines should be followed:Mandatory acceptance.If CBDCs are granted mandatory acceptance by merchants, they would have a significant advantage over private payment solutions, which take years to scale up merchant acceptance. Careful consideration is needed to balance this.Market-Driven Compensation and Pricing.The compensation and pricing for CBDCs should be in line with the market (ie based on market analysis, established market impact assessments and pricing regulation) to ensure fairness. Above all, public subsidies should be avoided. The cornerstone of an open market economy is based on vibrant competition which drives better consumer outcomes.Regulatory Impartiality.As the issuer and regulator, the central bank should not exploit its privileged position to disadvantage competing payment methods. Regulatory measures must be impartial.Consistent Regulatory Standards.Apply the principle of \\u201csame activity, same risk, same regulation\\u201d to ensure that CBDCs are subject to the same regulatory requirements (e.g., oversight and AML checks) as private payment solutions.Create Interoperability:Designing CBDCs to integrate seamlessly with existing national and international payment systems is critical. This means relying on widely used standards and technologies to minimize costs and implementation burdens for intermediaries, service providers and merchants. Focusing on interoperability, rather than building a new infrastructure, would increase resilience and promote innovation by allowing the industry to build new services based on existing ones, thus reducing time-to-market. Ensuring compatibility with a wide array of solutions, including traditional banking, stablecoins, and potentially other CBDCs, is essential.By taking these positive actions, central banks, governments and legislators can create an environment where both CBDCs and private payment solutions thrive, driving competition, innovation, and improved financial services for all users. Partnerships between the public and private sectors will be key to successfully ushering in transformational change, drive adoption, and create the best end-user experience. Ongoing payments innovation, expanded financial inclusion, and the efficiency of national and international payment flows all depend on vibrant private sector competition. If a CBDC is the right path for a central bank to reach its objectives, the private sector can help central banks bring their vision to life and realize their goals.ReferencesMcWaters, J., Wann, J., Baert, C., De Matteis, A., and Cuccuru, P.

A **CBDC** is a digital representation of a nation\\u2019s fiat currency, issued and regulated by its central bank. Unlike the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, **CBDCs** aim to maintain a stable value tied directly to the country\\u2019s existing currency.Countries around the globe, from theBahamasto China, are actively exploring or have already initiated **CBDC projects**. The primary objective is to enhance financial inclusion, offering secure and efficient payment options for those without access to traditional banking systems. As noted in areportby the U.S. Federal Reserve, **CBDCs** have the potential to significantly reduce cross-border transaction costs, bolster the international standing of dominant currencies like the dollar, and simplify access to financial services.However, this shift to digital currencies also presents several challenges. **Privacy concerns**, potential **cybersecurity threats**, and the impact on existing banking structures are critical issues that need careful consideration. Ensuring robust **cybersecurity frameworks** and balancing transaction monitoring to prevent financial crimes are essential steps in this journey.**CBDCs** are categorized into two main types:wholesaleandretail. Wholesale **CBDCs** are typically used by financial institutions for interbank transactions, while retail **CBDCs** are consumer-focused, allowing potentially anonymous transactions using public or private keys.While smaller nations like Jamaica, Nigeria, and the Bahamas have already implemented **CBDCs**, larger economies and groups like the G20 are still in the exploratory stages, assessing the implications for monetary policy and financial stability.For more in-depth information, the original article can be found onInvestopedia.Leave A CommentCancel replyCommentSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Total Views: 13Daily Views: 0ByCameron Academy AuthorCategories:Article,Digital Currency,FinanceTags:Central Bank Digital Currencies,Financial InclusionPublished On: December 13, 2024Last Updated: December 13, 2024Review This PageAny Further Feedback?SubmitWe have received your VOTE!

However, many cities are increasingly looking tozoning reformas a pivotal strategy to boost housing supply. AsUrban Land Magazinereports, the severity of the crisis has pushed it to the forefront of political agendas, making politicians more inclined to tackle the issue.City planner M. Nolan Gray, author ofArbitrary Lines: How Zoning Broke the American City and How to Fix It, highlights the shift in urban policies. \\u201cDozens of cities have scrapped exclusionary single-family home zoning and parking requirements, which was previously inconceivable,\\u201d Gray notes.The Shift Towards Inclusive ZoningDavid Garcia, policy director for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, underscores the growing openness tozoning changes. \\u201cMany jurisdictions are reluctant to usezoning reformdue to backlash, but the idea of allowing multiple units on single-family parcels is gaining traction,\\u201d Garcia explains.Despite the momentum, the impact of recentzoning changesis still unfolding. Garcia warns that piecemeal reforms may not achieve the desired outcomes, and comprehensivezoning changesare often challenging to implement.According to Toccarra Nicole Thomas, director of land use and development at Smart Growth America,zoninghas historically contributed to the crisis by focusing on low-density, auto-centric housing. \\u201cZoning is inherently inflexible,\\u201d Thomas asserts. She advocates for comprehensive reform to effectively generateaffordable housing.Strategies for Effective Zoning ReformGray suggests that allowing \\u201cby right\\u201d building permits could significantly streamline the development process. Other recommendedzoning reformsinclude reducing lot size requirements, eliminating parking restrictions, and allowing manufactured housing.Reducing lot size requirementsEliminating parking restrictionsAllowing manufactured housingSeveral cities have successfully implementedzoning reforms. In Oakland, California, the transformation of Auto Row into a residential hub is a prime example. Similarly, Washington, D.C., has seen the revitalization of former industrial areas like the Navy Yard and NoMa into vibrant mixed-use communities.Political Challenges and OpportunitiesZoning reformis not without its political challenges. Thomas points out that reform efforts often face opposition from NIMBYs (Not In My Backyard) and BANANAs (Building Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything). However, engaging with community stakeholders and building coalitions can help overcome resistance.Garcia advises developers to engage with communities early in the planning process to demonstrate the benefits of new housing developments. \\u201cData showing that new housing can increase the value of existing homes can be persuasive,\\u201d he says.Ultimately,zoning reformis a gradual process. As Gray emphasizes, \\u201cWe\\u2019re rolling back 100 years of policy that made it nearly impossible to build housing in dense cities, so it will take time to fix.\\u201d Yet, progress is being made, and the potential for transformative change is on the horizon.For further insights, explore theReshaping the City: Zoning for a More Equitable, Resilient, and Sustainable Futurereport and the accompanyingwebinar, featuring experts like Nolan Gray and Toccarra Nicole Thomas.\\u201c`Read More1410, 2024Florida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesGalleryFlorida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesArticle,Economics,EnvironmentFlorida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T23:49:32-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Economics,Environment|Tags:Natural Disasters,Politics|0 CommentsFlorida Faces Daunting Recovery After Dual Hurricane AssaultAsHurricane Miltongathered strength in the south-western Gulf of Mexico,Floridabraced itself for a second blow in as many weeks.

While major urban centers likeTampaandSt Petersburgnarrowly avoided the worst, other regions along the Gulf coast were not as fortunate. The devastation has been unprecedented, withdestruction sweepingthrough communities, leaving a trail of ruin in its wake.The human toll is staggering: approximately250 lives lost, countless homes destroyed, and millions left without power. The financial cost is equally severe, with early estimates placing the damage fromHurricane Miltonalone at$160 billion to $180 billion. When combined with the losses fromHurricane Helene, Florida is facing a financial hit nearinghalf a trillion dollars, a figure that threatens to erase expected economic growth for the coming quarters.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, addressing the situation, noted the resilience required to recover from such disasters. \\u201cWe did not get the worst-case scenario, but we did get hit,\\u201d he said, emphasizing the long road to recovery ahead. The state\\u2019s experience as themost hurricane-proneregion in the nation underscores the challenges that lie ahead.Even as rescue operations continue, the broader implications of these storms are becoming apparent.

TheCenter for American Progress\\u2019s reportdelves into potential solutions through local land-use reforms aimed at alleviating these pressures.The study reveals daunting statistics\\u2014nearly 11.2 million households spend over half their income on rent. This housing cost burden signals an urgent need for comprehensive strategies to ease financial pressures on renters and potential homeowners alike. The current housing market challenges, driven by historical zoning ordinances that limit affordable options, point to a reform path that could significantly alter the landscape.Local Land Use Reform as a Key SolutionThe push for reformingzoning lawsfocuses on expanding the supply of affordable housing by revisiting and updating restrictive local policies. Traditional zoning practices have long favored single-family homes, inadvertently fostering exclusion and driving up housing costs. By transitioning to more inclusive zoning codes, communities can potentially unlock a diverse range of housing solutions\\u2014without the reliance on federal or state subsidies.Federal Initiatives and Grassroots MovementsThe federal government\\u2019s proposed Building Opportunity program could be pivotal, offering financial incentives to jurisdictions that commit to significant zoning reforms.

Withcyber incidentson the rise and associated business costssoaring, many experts view it as indispensable. The globalcyber insurance marketis projected to reach a staggering $90.6 billion by 2033, underscoring its escalating relevance.Challenges in CurrentCyber Insurance PoliciesDespite its necessity, many organizations find that theircyber insurance policiesare not working effectively. According to a 2023 Delinea report, there is a growing disconnect between carriers and enterprises, leading to numerous claims beingrejected. This issue is particularly prevalent among small businesses, which face an increase incyberattacksyet often remain uncertain about their coverage details.A striking example comes from a 2022 report by the UK\\u2019s Federation of Small Businesses, revealing that 38% of its members withcyber insurancedo not know what their policy includes. Furthermore, a recent study by Aviva found that only 17% of small businesses havecyber insurance, illustrating the widespread skepticism and lack of adoption in the sector.Barriers to Effective CoverageOne of the primary barriers to effectivecyber insurance coverageis the complexity and ambiguity of policy terms. Tarnveer Singh, CISO of The Exeter, highlighted that this can lead to disputes and delays duringcyber incidents, exacerbating stress and financial strain for policyholders. The evolving nature ofcyber threatsadds another layer of complexity, often resulting in inadequate or overpriced policies.Additionally, the growing cost of premiums, projected to

IntroductionThe world is moving rapidly toward a digital future, raising questions and challenges for central banks. Digital technologies have advanced faster than any innovation in human history (Figures 1and2), and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this pace (Abidi, El-Herradi, and Sakha 2023). To keep up with this trend and harness its significant economic benefits, governments are adopting digitalization strategies to transform public services and increase their efficiency.1With payments becoming increasingly digitalized, one question is whether a structural shift from a reliance on cash to digital currencies could materialize. Many central banks are reflecting on how to achieve their policy objectives in this changing landscape. One option to preserve the key role of central bank-issued money in a digital world is to adopt a central bank digital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is a digital liability of the central bank used as a means of payment by the population (retail) or financial institutions (wholesale).View Full SizeFigure 1.Digital Ecosystems in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: International Telecommunication Union; and IMF staff calculations.Note: AE = advanced economy; CCA = Caucasus and Central Asia; EM = emerging market; GCC = Gulf Cooperation Council; ME&CA = Middle East and Central Asia; MENA = Middle East and North Africa; OE = oil exporter; Ol= oil importer.Download FigureDownload figure as PowerPoint slideAs of October 2023, 130 countries, representing 98 percent of global GDP, were exploring the potential use of a CBDC (Kosse and Mattei 2022).2,3A survey of IMF country teams representing 31 Middle East and Central Asia (ME&CA) economies4finds that 19 countries are considering or exploring a CBDC. This is consistent with information from country authorities\\u2019 public statements (Figure 3). Most ME&CA countries interested in a CBDC are at the research stage, while a few are at the proof-of-concept5stage (Bahrain, Georgia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates). Kazakhstan is most advanced in its journey to CBDC, having initiated two pilots of the digital tenge (DT; NBK 2021;Handagama 2023). The region\\u2019s fragile and conflict-affected states (FCSs) and low-income countries (LICs) have expressed limited interest. Three country case studies (Jordan, Kazakhstan, Libya), each at different stages of CBDC exploration, can be found in Annex 4.View Full SizeFigure 2.Broadband Ecosystem in ME&CA(Per 100 inhabitants)Citation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: International Telecommunication Union; and IMF staff calculations.Note: \\u201cFixed broadband subscriptions\\u201d refers to fixed subscriptions to high-speed access to the public internet (a TCP/IP connection) at downstream speeds equal to or greater than 256 kbits per second. \\u201cActive mobile broadband subscriptions\\u201d refers to the sum of active handset-based and computer-based (USB/dongles) mobile broadband subscriptions that allow access to the internet.

CBDC = central bank digital currency; ME&CA = Middle East and Central Asia.Download FigureDownload figure as PowerPoint slideEnhancing financial inclusion and domestic and cross-border payment efficiency are among the main CBDC policy objectives in the ME&CA region. The survey indicates that most ME&CA countries, especially those interested in financial inclusion (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic), are primarily interested in retail CBDCs. Hence, this paper will focus on retail CBDCs. A few countries are exploring wholesale CBDCs with local commercial banks and fintech partners (Saudi Arabia).6The key questions policymakers need to consider when exploring possible CBDC adoption are the following: What objectives do policymakers aim to achieve with a CBDC? Which inefficiencies in payment systems can CBDCs address? What are the implications of CBDC issuance for financial stability, monetary policy pass-through, and central bank operational risk? How can CBDC design help achieve policy objectives and mitigate these risks?Although there are no clear economic prerequisites to adopting a CBDC, the choice to issue a CBDC is complex and country dependent. Each country has different objectives, payment and financial systems, legal and regulatory frameworks, and central bank capacity. CBDCs are also a relatively new concept, with limited adoption and uptake to date, making it challenging to draw lessons from other countries. Hence, policymakers should approach CBDCs cautiously: successful implementation will require comprehensive analysis. In this respect, the IMF has been helping country authorities evaluate the need to issue a CBDC and establish strong policies and regulatory frameworks through capacity development. As of February 2023, seven ME&CA countries had received IMF capacity development on CBDC. In addition, the institution is leading the way with a significant number of analytical pieces,7including a comprehensive CBDC handbook guided by specific country capacity development questions on CBDC-related topics (IMF 2023b) (Box 1).Box 1.Capacity Development on Central Bank Digital CurrenciesThe IMF\\u2019s Digital Money Strategy, which the Executive Board endorsed in July 2021, gives the institution a mandate to help ensure that digital money fosters domestic and international economic and financial stability (IMF 2021a). The IMF has increased its analytical work and capacity development delivery on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The objective is to strengthen the capacity of member countries to assess, design, pilot, implement, and supervise CBDCs. Ultimately, both analytical work and capacity development delivery will contribute to country economic and financial stability and the stability of the international monetary system by making country payment systems and macrofinancial frameworks more resilient.In terms of analytical work, theIMF (2023d)released five chapters of theCBDC Virtual Handbookin November 2023. This handbook is a guide that aims to gather lessons learned and develop frameworks and guidance for member countries. It is meant to be a reference for policymakers and experts at central banks and finance ministries. This major project will generate about 20 chapters over the next five years, with four to five chapters being released per year. The chapter topics are chosen based on country needs and feasibility. The first set of chapters included a decision-making framework, a product development methodology, and implications for financial inclusion, monetary policy transmission, and capital flow management measures. The chapters will be updated regularly to reflect the latest developments and policies related to CBDCs. A second set of chapters will be published in 2024. Potential topics include financial stability; CBDC distribution, incentives, and adoption; cyber security; the relationship between CBDCs and other payment systems; cross-border payments; and implications for data frameworks and privacy protection.Regarding capacity development, the IMF works with countries through bilateral capacity development and regional workshops. The bilateral capacity development aims to provide tailored, practical, innovative, and technical advice to countries based on solid and thorough analysis and lessons learned from other countries. After capacity development delivery, countries should be better equipped to (1) understand the different uses, designs, ecosystem, and advantages and disadvantages of CBDCs; (2) understand the capacity, processes, and cost requirements involved in exploring and implementing CBDCs; (3) evaluate whether CBDCs are suitable for their economies given their specific goals, challenges, capacities, and the nature of their payment and financial sectors; (4) plan and test different stages of CBDC exploration, including creating prototypes and conducting trials to test specific policies; (5) design policies, such as regulations, to accompany CBDCs and promote financial inclusion and integrity; and (6) understand and prepare for any potential effects that their CBDC or a CBDC from another country may have on their economy. More than 30 bilateral capacity development and regional workshops have taken place, with a quarter of them focusing on Middle East and Central Asia countries. In June 2023, the IMF and Morocco co-hosted a high-level policy discussion on CBDCs to share knowledge and information among Middle East and Central Asia countries.The IMF has been actively participating in international working groups within the Group of Twenty and the Group of Seven to study how CBDCs can be used for cross-border transfers. They are exploring new ways to improve cross-border payments by analyzing innovative solutions, such as multilateral platforms, that use innovative technology to connect payments between countries using CBDCs and traditional payment systems. The IMF and World Bank have developed an approach to provide technical assistance for cross-border payments. The IMF has identified specific areas where assistance can be most effective in achieving the goals outlined in the Group of Twenty Roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments while safeguarding the integrity of the financial system.2. CBDC ObjectivesWhat objectives do policymakers hope to achieve by adopting a CBDC? Country authorities have multifaceted reasons for exploring the adoption of CBDCs (see Annex 3 for a complete list debated in the literature). The survey of IMF ME&CA country teams identifies enhancingfinancial inclusionandpayment system efficiencyas the top priorities for exploring CBDCs in the ME&CA region (Table 1).8In Middle East and North Africa (MENA) oil exporters and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the motivation for exploring CBDCs is to make payments more efficient, both domestically and cross-border (for example, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) (Schickler 2022; Central Bank of United Arab Emirates 2023). In contrast, the top priority in Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) countries is to increase financial inclusion; improving payment system efficiency and promoting innovation in financial technology are also important objectives in this region. In Georgia, where the focus is on a CBDC\\u2019s potential to promote financial inclusion, the central bank has been actively researching CBDC capabilities, design, and potential use cases since 2020 and officially launched a limited access live pilot of the digital lari with Ripple Labs through the cutting-edge Ripple CBDC platform (National Bank of Georgia 2023). MENA oil importers (for example, Jordan) also rank promoting financial inclusion and the efficiency of payment systems as key motivations for exploring CBDCs (IMF 2022d).Several lower-middle-income countries have built national agendas focused on deepening financial inclusion. In June 2021, Uzbekistan\\u2019s first National Financial Inclusion Strategy (for 2021\\u201323) identified promoting digital payments as a key priority. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan is also promoting digital banking and payments, revising and approving regulation that expands access to remote banking and provides for bank accounts to be opened remotely using digital identification (EBRD 2023).Table 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupSource: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.Table 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupCountry GroupMaking Payments More Efficient (cross-border)Making Payments More Efficient (domestic)Broadening Access to PaymentsIncreasing Financial InclusionMENA Oil Exporters\\u2713\\u2713MENA Oil Importers\\u2713\\u2713Caucasus and Central Asia\\u2713\\u2713Low-Income Countries\\u2713Gulf Cooperation Council Countries\\u2713\\u2713Fragile and Conflict-Affected States\\u2713\\u2713Emerging Markets\\u2713\\u2713Source: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.View TableTable 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupCountry GroupMaking Payments More Efficient (cross-border)Making Payments More Efficient (domestic)Broadening Access to PaymentsIncreasing Financial InclusionMENA Oil Exporters\\u2713\\u2713MENA Oil Importers\\u2713\\u2713Caucasus and Central Asia\\u2713\\u2713Low-Income Countries\\u2713Gulf Cooperation Council Countries\\u2713\\u2713Fragile and Conflict-Affected States\\u2713\\u2713Emerging Markets\\u2713\\u2713Source: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.3. Payment Systems and Benefits of CBDC in ME&CAUnderstanding payment systems and their inherent inefficiencies in the region will help ascertain the potential benefits of CBDCs and, specifically, whether CBDCs can help achieve the objectives of ME&CA policymakers to enhance financial inclusion and the efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems.A. Financial Inclusion and Payment Systems in ME&CAIn general, there is a low level of financial inclusion in ME&CA countries, though there is a marked divergence across the region. For example, access to bank accounts in ME&CA countries is lower than the global average, indicating a low level of financial inclusion (Figure 4, panel 1) (Cardarelli, Vera-Martin, and Lall 2022,Blancher and others, 2019). However, access to bank accounts is relatively higher in the GCC, while low-income Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP) countries have the lowest access. The percentage of the adult population with bank accounts ranges from 6 percent in Sudan to 90 percent in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Figure 4, panel 2). Access to bank accounts appears to correlate with countries\\u2019 income levels but remains well below the global average.Similarly, although the adoption of digital payment methods in ME&CA countries is progressing, there is considerable variation, and the region overall is behind other regions (Figure 5).9This heterogeneity in digital payment adoption could be attributed to several factors. The impact of the pandemic and the need for economic diversification have driven an increase in digital payments in the GCC countries (Economist Intelligence Unit 2020). Saudi Arabia has the fastest digital payments adoption rate thanks to a comprehensive digital payment strategy under its Vision 2030 development plan.10Within the MENA region, there is a wide discrepancy in the adoption of digital payments. Countries like the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have high levels of digital payment usage, with 85 percent, 73 percent, and 77 percent of adults utilizing digital payments in 2021, respectively. In contrast, countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have significantly lower adoption rates at 14 percent and 8 percent, respectively. This disparity in adoption rates may reflect the high cost of existing digital payment systems in some countries, which can exclude certain segments of the population. In the CCA, Kazakhstan is making significant progress in increasing digital payments, with the amount of non-cash payments increasing by 2.5 times in 2021 compared to 2019 (PwC 2023).Despite having a digitally savvy population, some ME&CA countries still heavily rely on cash for transac-tions.11Cash in circulation is particularly high in the region\\u2019s LICs and FCSs (Figure 6). For example, in Iraq and Mauritania, cash in circulation was about 26 percent of GDP in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In contrast, cash in circulation has been declining in the GCC, averaging only 5.4 percent of GDP in 2021, reflecting the region\\u2019s digital advancement.View Full SizeFigure 4.Account Ownership, 2021(Percent of adults over age 15)Citation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Global Financial Inclusion database 2021;and IMF staff calculations.Note: Data labels in the figure use International Organization for Standardization (ISO) country codes.

The region\\u2019s informal sector plays a substantial role in the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and employing about 65 percent of the labor force. Only about one-third of retail transactions are conducted electronically in the region. This high reliance on cash is also due to tax and loan debt evasion, concealment of the intended use of money, underbanked consumer and merchant segments, a cultural bias toward cash, low wealth, and lack of trust in financial institutions (Figure 7) (Abidi and others 2023;Gatti and others 2014;Chan and others 2021).View Full SizeFigure 6.Reliance on Cash in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Haver Analytics; ILOSTAT database; national authorities; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Cash ratios are computed as currency in circulation divided by nominal GDP.

Remittance flows to ME&CA countries reached $447 billion in 2021, dwarfng other high-volume flows such as portfolio investment and official development assistance. However, the most common way to send and receive domestic remittances is still by another person using cash (Figure 8, panel 2).12The opposite is true in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, where account-based remittance transfers are most common, followed by those from money transfer operators. Cost does not seem to be a key impediment since the cost of remittances across all corridors and providers from the MENA region to receiving countries is below the global and sub-Saharan Africa averages (Figure 8, panels 3 and 4).View Full SizeFigure 8.Remittances in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: IMF, Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics database; World Bank, Remittance Prices Worldwide; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Sent or received domestic remittances: using an account (percent age 15+).

Benefits of CBDCs in ME&CACBDCs can help policymakers achieve their primary objectives of enhancing financial inclusion and payment system efficiency (domestic and cross-border) if they can address the inherent gaps in current systems.Financial InclusionCBDCs have the potential to advance financial inclusion by creating more competition for consumers and allowing for transactions to be settled more directly through reduced intermediation, thereby lowering the cost of financial services and making them more accessible. Unlike commercial banks, the lack of a profit motive by the central bank can also help keep costs lower. Considering that the financial system in the ME&CA region is heavily bank-dominated with a relatively high profit margin, CBDCs have the potential to advance financial inclusion.CBDCs could also help enhance the service quality for payment service providers (PSPs) and spur further innovation in the digital payment system by simplifying market entry for PSPs and removing the need for negotiations to access specific payment infrastructures and banking services. Similar effects could be achieved through policy reforms that enable nonbank entities to access central bank accounts and provide risk-based, fair, and transparent access to critical payment infrastructures, as seen in the case of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, given that a CBDC would carry the safety of central bank money and legal tender status, it could help overcome distrust in financial services and broaden access. CBDCs could also provide the needed technological infrastructure from scratch (a \\u201cclean slate\\u201d) if it does not already exist; hence, providing a public good that may be particularly relevant for LICs and FCSs, which may lack such infrastructure and where the share of the underserved population is particularly high.Payment SystemsCBDCs have the potential to help improve the efficiency of payment systems, both domestic and cross-border. By spurring competition in the domestic payment market, CBDCs can lower costs and update legacy technology platforms. As for cross-border payment systems, these are prone to various frictions, such as fragmented and truncated data formats across regions, complex processing of compliance checks, limited operating hours across jurisdictions, lack of payment system interoperability (due to differences in domestic legislation), and legacy technology platforms. These frictions result in high fees due to multiple intermediaries (correspondent banking) and a lack of guarantee as to whether the funds have been received in full (that is, finality). CBDCs could simplify the intermediation chains and increase availability (as they would operate on a 24/7 basis) by starting a \\u201cclean slate\\u201d system designed to achieve interoperability between different jurisdictions and allowing for real-time payment service (BIS, IMF, and World Bank 2021). The United Arab Emirates\\u2019 mBridge project is a good example for aiming to resolve these inefficiencies with wholesale CBDCs.By improving the efficiency of cross-border payments, CBDCs could also enable the flow of international remittances. This, in turn, can play an essential role in supporting economic development and financial inclusion.13CCA and MENA oil-importing economies, considering their high reliance on cash, including for remittances, could reap significant gains from improving the efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems. Cheaper and more accessible remittances will benefit senders and recipients, help buffer economic shocks, and stimulate growth.Despite the potential of CBDCs to improve financial inclusion and improve payments systems efficiency, it is crucial to recognize that CBDCs are not a panacea. Therefore, policymakers should conduct a comprehensive analysis of the various alternatives as some of the benefits of CBDCs could be achieved through other means. For example, facilitating the entry of new players in the market and providing comprehensive regulation and supervision of the entities to uphold the stability and integrity of the payment system can also improve competition. Increased competition could also occur through improved access to central bank accounts by PSPs, to avoid intermediaries in payment services provision.CBDCs may also not be able to overcome existing barriers to financial inclusion, such as those due to limited identification and financial literacy, low wealth, and high informality, which tend to be associated with a strong preference for physical cash. Regarding cross-border payments, some regional initiatives are already addressing inefficiencies by fostering payment system interoperability. Specifically, the GCC Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and the Arab Regional Payment System aim to streamline intraregional payment flows and improve the cross-border payment ecosystem (Box 2). In addition, CBDCs could coexist with other payment systems already in place and are not an either/or solution.Box 2.Improving Cross-Border Payment SystemsGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS)Led by the six central banks of the GCC (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates)What will it do?The GCC RTGS will provide an overarching regional payment system connecting the individual domestic RTGS payment systems of each of the six GCC countries, enabling an efficient delivery of intra-GCC payments in the fiat currencies of the six countries. For example, a Saudi riyal payment originated in the United Arab Emirates and destined for a beneficiary in Saudi Arabia would occur over the domestic United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabian payment systems, instead of relying on bilateral correspondent banking frameworks.What are the benefits?The GCC RTGS would create standardization, drive efficiency, bring predictability, and reduce costs, as cross-border payments would previously be delivered using domestic payment system architecture. This would bring the experience of a pan-regional cross-border payment closer to that of a domestic payment.Arab Regional Payment System (known as BUNA)Led by the Arab Monetary FundWhat will it do?The system aims to create a central routing agent to provide a standardized payment experience across the Arab countries. With a common set of operating rules and a standardized SWIFT platform, BUNA would bring together the markets of the GCC and the Middle East and North Africa for all intraregional payments, covering not just the fiat currencies of the Arab countries but also key principally traded currencies such as the US dollar and euro.What are the benefits?Already \\u201clive\\u201d with the Emirati dirham, Egyptian pound, and Saudi Arabian riyal, BUNA is looking to augment currencies, countries, and commercial bank participation over the near to medium term to provide efficiency and standardization to intraregional cross-border payments. Soon, BUNA aims to enhance the platform further by introducing instant and real-time delivery of pan-regional cross-border payments and providing the foundation to support other financial market infrastructure.Sources: Arab Monetary Fund; andChan and others (2021).4. Financial Systems and Financial Stability Implications of CBDCs in ME&CAUnderstanding ME&CA financial systems will help to ascertain how CBDCs may affect financial stability in the ME&CA region. The relatively healthy financial systems in the region could support CBDC adoption. However, a country-specific analysis is paramount, including given the heterogeneity of financial systems across the region.A. ME&CA Financial SystemsME&CA financial systems are primarily dominated by banks (Figure 9). Nonbank financial institutions\\u2014 pension funds, asset management and finance companies, and insurance\\u2014are underdeveloped in the region and are generally not involved in credit intermediation. Banks\\u2019 total assets reached $2.4 trillion in 2021 (185 percent of GDP), up from $1.7 trillion in 2016 (149 percent of GDP).14,15Still, there is significant heterogeneity across the region.In the GCC, financial systems are large, having grown in recent years thanks to buoyant economic activity fueled by large hydrocarbon proceeds and abundant liquidity. At the end of 2021, banks\\u2019 lending to GDP reached $2.7 trillion (or 198 percent of non-oil GDP) compared to other emerging markets (44 percent of GDP). Bahrain (the smallest GCC economy) ranks first in terms of banking system size with a ratio of banking system assets to non-oil GDP of 552 percent, while Saudi Arabia (by far the largest economy in the region) has the smallest ratio of banking system assets to non-oil GDP of 100 percent.Financial sectors in the CCA region are relatively small and underdeveloped. Georgia has the largest banking sector in the region and is close to the global average of emerging markets, as measured by banking system assets to GDP. In contrast, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan have relatively small banking sectors, less than half the size of the average banking sector in the region.Banking systems in the MENAP region are relatively heterogeneous. Jordan and Morocco have the largest banking sectors within this subregion. Despite the relative size of the economy, Pakistan\\u2019s banking sector is relatively small (47 percent of banking system assets to GDP).View Full SizeFigure 9.Bank Asset Structure in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Fitch Connect; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Figure uses 2021 values.

        "value": "The introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is poised to have significant impacts on the traditional banking system and financial stability over the next five years. Here are some key considerations based on the available reference materials:\n\n1. **Impact on Traditional Banking:**\n   - **Bank Disintermediation:** CBDCs could potentially lead to disintermediation of traditional banks, as consumers might prefer holding CBDCs directly with central banks over traditional bank deposits. This could lead to reduced bank deposits, affecting banks' ability to lend and potentially increasing their reliance on equity and wholesale funding (Cameron Academy, European Economy).\n   - **Competition and Innovation:** CBDCs could spur competition in the payment market by lowering costs and encouraging innovation. They might simplify access to financial services and open the market for new players, including fintech companies, to offer innovative payment solutions (IMF, European Economy).\n   - **Role of Banks:** Banks might play a different role in distributing CBDCs, potentially acting as intermediaries in a two-tier system where they distribute CBDCs issued by the central bank. This could impact their revenue models and necessitate adaptation to new operational roles (Cameron Academy, European Economy).\n\n2. **Financial Stability:**\n   - **Monetary Policy Transmission:** CBDCs could enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy by providing central banks with better tools to control the money supply directly. This could lead to more efficient monetary policy transmission and potentially enhance financial stability (Cameron Academy).\n   - **Risk Management:** There are concerns regarding the operational risks for central banks managing CBDCs, including cybersecurity threats and privacy issues. Effective implementation will require robust cybersecurity frameworks and privacy measures to maintain trust and security (Cameron Academy, IMF).\n   - **Cross-Border Transactions:** CBDCs could improve the efficiency of cross-border payments by reducing costs and processing times, thus potentially enhancing financial stability by facilitating international trade and reducing transaction frictions (IMF).\n\n3. **Regulatory and Policy Frameworks:**\n   - To ensure a balanced impact on financial stability, comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be needed. These frameworks should address issues such as cybersecurity, data privacy, and the interoperability of CBDCs with existing financial systems (Cameron Academy, European Economy).\n\nIn conclusion, while CBDCs offer opportunities for improving payment systems and financial inclusion, their introduction will require careful consideration of their impacts on traditional banking and financial stability. Policymakers will need to address potential risks through robust regulatory frameworks and ensure that the benefits of CBDCs are realized without undermining the existing financial system."

These benefits are also largely applicable to digital currencies like CBDCs. Digital payments tend to be cheaper, better and faster than physical cash transactions, which makes them instrumental for increasing financial inclusion and reducing transaction costs for individuals and businesses. CBDCs aim to combine the benefits of digital currencies with the reliability of traditional financial systems. The introduction of CBDCs could also impact international financial stability, as countries would need to navigate the complexities of cross-border digital currency transactions. CBDCs could lead to more resilient and inclusive financial systems, reducing the dependence on physical cash and traditional banking infrastructure.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their potential impact on ...\\nURL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42521-023-00090-0\\nCONTENT: Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their potential impact on traditional banking and monetary policy: an initial analysis | Digital Finance The economics of Central Bank Digital Currency.

This study\\u2019s objectives are as follows: 1) To show how the model variables react to shocks in CBDC uncertainty in terms of equal-interval and time-point impulse responses, and expose the lagged relationship between CBDC uncertainty and financial variables in terms of the TVP-SV-VAR model; 2) To demonstrate the volatility spillover effects among financial variables by using the BEKK-MGARCH model; and 3) To determine whether CBDC uncertainty has varying impacts on financial variables at different frequencies (under normal and extreme conditions) by employing WQC analysis.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[9]:\\nTITLE: CBDC and banking stability: Modeling cascading effects on reserves ...\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090944324000693\\nCONTENT: It is based on this observation that this article aims to analyse the potential impact of the introduction of CBDCs on the banking system, with a focus on the effects of excess confidence in CBDCs, the effects of covering each CBDC issuance with mandatory reserves in fiat currency, the effects of higher interest rates in the context of CBDC issuance, and the effects of rapid growth in the creation of scriptural money in the context of CBDCs. To achieve our objective, we employ dynamic modelling of the behaviour of the main economic agents, namely the central bank and secondary banks, to derive a dynamically stable unique equilibrium model.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nQuery: how will CBDCs affect banks over the next five years\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: CBDCs will further fragment the global economy\\u2014and could threaten the ...\\nURL: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/cbdcs-will-further-fragment-the-global-economy-and-could-threaten-the-dollar/\\nCONTENT: By the end of 2023, over 130 central banks representing 98 percent of global GDP will have initiated programs to develop central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Most central banks are working on both retail and wholesale CBDCs. Central banks expect to launch a little later than they expected to last year. The likelihood that a wholesale CBDC will be issued within the next six years is now greater than that for retail.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Outlook 2025: Will central banks pick up the pace on CBDCs?\\nURL: https://currencyinsider.com/2025/01/10/outlook-2025-will-central-banks-pick-up-the-pace-on-cbdcs/\\nCONTENT: Holding limits, the maximum amount of digital currency that users could hold in an account, is another concern that central banks would need to address.

The OMFIF said technical challenges are no longer a serious obstacle for the vast majority of central banks; in previous surveys, technical features like offline payments, privacy and interoperability with existing payment systems were cited as barriers to a CBDC. The survey also found that the share of central banks responding that they were more inclined to issue a CBDC dropped to 18%, down from 38% in 2022.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: Preserving the Dollar: The Role of CBDCs in Securing Economic Stability ...\\nURL: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2024/07/16/preserving-the-dollar-the-role-of-cbdcs-in-securing-economic-stability-for-future-generations/\\nCONTENT: Issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can help developed countries including the United States counteract these trends. ...

Opening this service to various providers would have the most serious impact on banks, however restricting it to the Central Bank only, will also deprive banks of profits from transaction processing due to outflow of deposits in fiat currency to CBDC. The most impactful approach would allow direct exchange of banking deposits in fiat currencies into CBDC.

A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a form of digital currency issued by a country's central bank. A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is the digital form of a country's fiat currency. A nation's monetary authority, or central bank, issues a CBDC, which promotes financial inclusion and simplifies the implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. Understanding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) CBDCs, backed by a government and controlled by a central bank, would give households, consumers, and businesses a secure means of exchanging digital currency.

The IMF Working Paper authored by Romain Bouis, Gaston Gelos, Paavo Miettinen, Fumitaka Nakamura, Erlend Nier, and Gabriel Soderberg, from the International Monetary Fund\\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets department, examines the implications of retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on financial stability. The authors highlight that the financial stability effects of CBDCs depend on several key factors, including the size of the issuance, the initial conditions of the financial system, and how both banks and central banks react. One of the central concerns raised in the paper is that the issuance of CBDCs could lead to disruptions in the traditional banking system, particularly in terms of financial intermediation.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: (PDF) The Impact of Digital Currencies on Traditional Banking: A ...\\nURL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388490670_The_Impact_of_Digital_Currencies_on_Traditional_Banking_A_Comparative_Study_of_Emerging_Markets\\nCONTENT: CBDCs are designed to work within the existing banking infrastructure, they could still undermine traditional banks by providing a direct digital alternative to bank deposits.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Examining the impact of a central bank digital currency on the access ...\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521924001522\\nCONTENT: Lastly, the fifth strand explores the link between CBDCs and the banking sector, proposing a model in which CBDCs afford central banks greater autonomy over the banking system, potentially impacting the role of commercial banks due to the possibility of central banks gaining a monopoly over bank deposits (Fernandez-Villaverde et al., 2021\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: The future of the international financial system: The emerging CBDC ...\\nURL: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rego.12520\\nCONTENT: The technical and regulatory complexity of CBDC requires central banks to have sufficient capacity to meet these issues.

These currencies work without central banks and governments using cryptography as a security means. They are alternatives to conventional banking systems. Bitcoin is the first currency of this kind, and since then, many others have been developed, such as Ethereum and Ripple.\\nThis increasing demand for digital currency traces back to a constantly rising need for decentralized systems, hence enabling efficient transactions with fewer intermediaries. These systems thus save cost while efficiently facilitating the process of transaction. As digital currency becomes popular, it is going to affect traditional banking.\\nIn this context, financial institutions are threatened with potential disruptions in their established business model and hence require a re-evaluation of strategy to integrate digital currency into their services. In this scenario, the transition would also have a change in consumer behavior as user behavior changes for ease and security in a transaction of digital currency.  \\nThis paper addresses the impact of digital currencies on traditional banking, looking at the challenges and opportunities ahead, and the ever-changing regulatory landscape. By studying these factors, a better understanding of the future of banking in the era of digital currencies will be developed.\\nWhat is a digital currency?\\nDigital currency is a medium of exchange that only comes in electronic form and is widely known as digital money, electronic money, electronic currency, or cybercash. In contrast with traditional currency, digital currencies do not have a physical counterpart and therefore cannot be physically handled or stored. They allow consumers and businesses to conduct transactions and trade in a virtual environment.\\nTypes of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currency is a broad term encompassing various forms of currency that exist solely in the electronic domain. Generally, digital currencies can be categorized into three main types:\\nCryptocurrencies\\nCryptocurrencies are digital currencies that deploy the use of cryptography not only to secure and confirm transactions in a network but also to govern creation. Notable examples comprise Bitcoin and Ethereum. The use of cryptocurrencies is regulated at a country-by-country and often viewed as virtual, as they live purely in the digital environment.\\nVirtual Currencies\\nVirtual currencies are unregulated digital currencies managed by developers or a founding organization composed of various stakeholders. They may also be governed by a specific network protocol. An example of a virtual currency is a gaming network token, whose economic framework is determined by its developers.\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\\nA central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a regulated digital currency issued by a country's central bank. In contrast to the traditional fiat currencies having physical and digital forms, the CBDC is purely digital. It is government-backed and seeks to make payments more efficient, reduces risks associated with cash handling, and promotes financial inclusion.\\nAdvantages of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currencies provide several significant benefits:\\nFast Transfers: The transactions are efficient and often free, happening directly between parties with no necessary intermediaries, unlike traditional banking systems.\\nNo Physical Manufacturing: They eliminate the need for the production of physical currency, which would otherwise be defective and contaminated.\\nMonetary Policy Implementation: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) allow governments to distribute payments directly to citizens, simplifying monetary processes without physical currency logistics.\\nLower Transaction Costs: Digital currencies enable direct payments within networks, reducing costs compared to physical currencies by cutting out middlemen.\\nDecentralization: Many digital currencies operate without government or financial institution control, enhancing resistance to censorship and manipulation.\\nPrivacy: Transactions are not tied to personal data, providing users with anonymity and confidentiality.\\nGlobal Accessibility: Anyone with internet access can use digital currencies, making them especially valuable in regions lacking traditional banking services.\\nDisadvantages of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currencies come with several notable drawbacks:\\nStorage and Infrastructure Issues: Although physical wallets are not required, digital currencies necessitate reliable internet access, smartphones, and secure online wallets for storage and processing.\\nHacking Vulnerability: The digital nature of these currencies makes them targets for hacking. Instances of stolen currencies from online wallets highlight the ongoing challenges of securing digital assets.\\nPrice Volatility: Digital currencies can experience significant price fluctuations, driven by market speculation and investor sentiment. This volatility can complicate their use as stable forms of currency.\\nLimited Acceptance: Many retailers and businesses do not yet accept digital currencies, making it difficult to use them for everyday transactions despite their growing popularity.\\nIrreversibility: Transactions made with digital currencies are final and cannot be reversed. This can pose challenges in cases of errors or fraud, particularly for newcomers who may lack familiarity with the technology.\\nEvolution of Digital Currencies\\nDigital currencies have evolved significantly since their inception, beginning with early concepts in the 1980s. David Chaum introduced\\u00a0eCash\\u00a0in 1983, a precursor to modern cryptocurrencies, which allowed for anonymous transactions. The late 1990s saw attempts like\\u00a0B-money\\u00a0and\\u00a0Bit Gold, but these did not achieve widespread success.\\nThe true breakthrough came in 2009 with the launch of\\u00a0Bitcoin\\u00a0by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who introduced blockchain technology, enabling secure, decentralized transactions without intermediaries. This innovation spurred the creation of thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), each aiming to improve upon Bitcoin's framework.\\nBy 2023, digital currencies had gained mainstream attention, with various countries exploring regulatory frameworks and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to integrate these innovations into traditional financial systems, marking a significant shift in the landscape of global finance.\\nWhat are Traditional Banking Systems?\\nTraditional banking systems are physical finance facility that accepts, deposits, provides loans, and facilitates payments and investments. The government authorities regulated the banking system which was operated through branches and ATMs, thereby being stable and protecting consumers as well as significant to the economy while facilitating various financial transactions.\\nAdvantages of Traditional Banking\\nIn-Person Visits: Traditional banks cater to customers who are skeptical about transacting through the internet. Customers can go to these banks within official working hours for several financial services like depositing cash, withdrawing, international transfers, and opening new accounts. There are also safe deposit boxes offered for customers to store valuable things and face-to-face contact that protects against fraud and identity theft.\\nFinancial Security: Traditional banking ensures security whereby money is safe and insured in case of any bank-related problems. There is a minimal threat of hackers or impersonators to account information if the customers are careful.\\nAccess to Loans: Traditional banks, having been around for ages in lending, have strict rules in place regarding interest rates and repayment terms. This is a sure guarantee that customers get the fairest of deals, unlike the predatory digital loan platforms that prey on borrowers with outrageous interest rates.\\nDisadvantages of Traditional Banking\\nCost of Transactions: Traditional banks impose fees for a range of services, from ATM maintenance to balance inquiries. These fees can accumulate over time, particularly if account holders do not maintain minimum balances or frequently transfer funds to other banks.\\nComplexity in Handling Customer Complaints: Although traditional banks offer face-to-face customer service, the complaint-resolution process might take a long time compared to an online bank. This is because the resolution often involves paperwork and bureaucratic procedures, which takes time.\\nAvailability: Traditional banks have special office hours that limit a customer's duration of accessing banking services. In case, the customer runs into problems outside office hours, he or she has either to refer the problem to online representatives or wait till the next business day.\\nStructure of Traditional Banking\\nThe structure of traditional banking consists of various components that work together to provide financial services. Key elements include:\\nHeadquarters: The central office where top management and corporate functions are located, overseeing the entire banking operations.\\nBranches: Physical locations where customers can access banking services, including opening accounts, depositing funds, and applying for loans. Branches are strategically placed to serve local communities.\\nATMs: Automated Teller Machines allow customers to perform basic banking transactions, such as withdrawals, deposits, and bala[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.digipay.guru/blog/rise-of-digital-currencies-and-impact-on-traditional-banking/\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nDigital Currencies: The Rise & Impact on Traditional Banking\\n\\nPlatform\\nSolutions\\nUse Cases\\nResources\\nCompany\\nRequest a Demo\\nMobile Payment ,\\nThe rise of digital currencies and their potential impact on traditional banking\\nThe rise of digital currencies and their potential impact on traditional banking\\nUpdated on February 22, 2023\\n9 min read\\nSHARE\\nDigital currencies, or virtual currencies, are digital or virtual forms of money that use cryptography for security. They are decentralized and operate independently of central banks or governments. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known digital currency, was created in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.\\nSince the creation of Bitcoin, a growing number of digital currencies have been developed. Some notable examples include Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin. These currencies have gained increasing attention and adoption over the past decade, with the total market capitalization of digital currencies namely bitcoin reaching over $1.28 trillion in 2021.\\nThis blog post will explore the rise of digital currencies and their potential impact on traditional banking. It will examine the factors driving the growth of digital currencies, the changes that may occur to financial institutions' business models, and the potential challenges and opportunities for banks in the face of this emerging trend.\\nAdditionally, the blog post will also cover the current regulatory landscape and potential future developments in government oversight of digital currencies.\\nThe rise of digital currencies\\nThe use of digital currencies has been steadily increasing over the past decade. According to a report by Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, there were an estimated 35 million unique digital currency users in 2021, with this number expected to continue to grow. In addition, a growing number of businesses, both online and offline, have begun to accept digital currencies as a form of payment.\\nApart from that, the digital currency market is dominated by a few key players. Bitcoin, the first and largest digital currency, has a market capitalization of over $421.35 billion in 2023. Other major players include Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin, each with market capitalizations of over $100 billion.\\nMoreover, the growth of digital currencies is driven by several factors. One major factor is increased interest in decentralized and trustless systems, as digital currencies operate independently of central banks or governments.\\nAdditionally, the growth of digital currencies has been driven by increasing recognition of their potential as a store of value and means of payment, as well as the increasing ease of buying and using digital currencies.\\nThe growing adoption of digital currencies by both individuals and businesses, as well as the increasing number of options for storing and using digital currencies, has also contributed to their growth.\\nAdvantages of Digital Currencies for Traditional Banks\\nThe popularity of digital currencies has been rising due to the myriad advantages that it provides. Some of the major advantages of digital currencies are mentioned below:\\n\\nSpeed and efficiency\\nFintech solutions like digital currencies have transformed the banking industry as it uses decentralized systems and blockchain technology, which allows for faster and more efficient transactions.\\nTransactions can be processed 24/7 without the need for intermediaries, such as banks. This means that transactions can be completed in a matter of minutes, rather than the days or weeks it can take with traditional banking.\\n\\nRead More: Top fintech solutions transforming the banking industry\\n\\nDecentralization and security\\nDigital currencies operate on a decentralized system, meaning that no single entity controls the currency. This decentralization also makes digital currencies more secure as there is no central point of failure. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger (the blockchain) which is secure and transparent.\\nLower transaction costs\\nDigital currencies can have lower transaction costs compared to traditional banking. This is because digital currencies do not require intermediaries such as banks, which can charge high fees for services like currency exchange and wire transfers.\\nAdditionally, digital currencies can also eliminate the need for physical currency, which can be costly to produce and distribute.\\nImproved customer experience\\nThe use of digital currencies has resulted in improved customer experience. Such currencies are renowned for their unparalleled convenience and seamlessness when used to carry out transactions.\\nUnlike traditional banks which come with difficult processing times, prolonged paperwork, and limited banking hours, digital currencies deliver instant and swift transactions. Through this, they present customers with a persuasive value proposition that traditional banks are finding challenging to reach.\\nNew revenue streams\\nTraditional banks can tap into new revenue streams as digital currencies become more prevalent.\\nThis means that banks can leverage the growing popularity of digital currencies by extending their customer base to include digital currency enthusiasts and businesses preferring digital currencies for their transactions. By doing so, they can create a more diverse customer base, while also boosting revenue streams.\\nThe potential impact of digital currencies on traditional banking\\nDigital currencies have the potential to greatly impact traditional banking. One of the most significant ways is by providing an alternative to traditional banking systems, which could lead to a decrease in the need for traditional banks.\\nDigital currencies allow for peer-to-peer payment app transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks. This could lead to lower transaction fees and faster, more efficient transactions.\\nChanges to financial institutions' business models\\nThe rise of digital currencies has the potential to significantly disrupt traditional banking business models. Digital currencies operate on decentralized systems, which do not rely on the intermediation of financial institutions and can be done through various digital payment apps.\\nThis could lead to disintermediation, where financial institutions are removed from the process of intermediating transactions. This could also lead to a reduction in revenue for traditional banks, as they would no longer be able to charge fees for services such as currency exchange and international money transfers.\\nEffects on consumer behavior and transaction processes\\nThe use of digital currencies could lead to changes in consumer behavior and transaction processes. Digital currencies allow for faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions, which could lead to increased adoption by consumers.\\nThis could also lead to changes in the way transactions are processed, as digital currencies operate on decentralized systems, which do not rely on the intermediation of financial institutions.\\nBoosting cross-border transactions\\nDigital currencies and other innovations in payment systems, such as mobile money and blockchain technology, have the potential to revolutionize the way we make transactions.\\nThey offer the possibility of faster, cheaper, and more efficient domestic and cross-border transactions, making it easier for people to access financial services and participate in the global economy.\\nFor example, by using digital currencies, people living in remote or rural areas, who may not have access to traditional banking services, can now easily transfer money to relatives or make payments for goods and services via digital banking. Thus, financial technologies like digital currencies are transforming international remittances.\\n\\nRead More: Impact of fintech on international remittances\\n\\nHence, digital currencies have the potential to greatly impact traditional banking by providing an alternative to traditional banking systems, increasing financial inclusion, and changing the way we think about money and financial systems.\\nHowever, the extent of this impact is still uncertain, and more research and development are needed to fully understand the implications of digital currencies on traditional banking.\\nPotential challenges and opportunities for banks\\nThe rise of digital currencies poses both challenges and opportunities for traditional banks. On one hand, digital currencies could lead to disintermediation and a reduction in revenue for banks.\\nOn the other hand, banks could explore ways to integrate digital currencies into their existing business models, such as offering cryptocurrency digital wallet solutions or facilitating the exchange of digital currencies.\\nAdditionally, some banks have started to research and invest in digital currencies and blockchain technology, which would allow them to stay competitive in the ever-changing market.\\nGovernment regulations and oversight\\nCurrent regulatory landscape\\nThe regulatory landscape for digital currencies varies by country. Some countries, such as Japan and South Korea, have embraced digital currencies and have implemented regulations to support their growth.\\nOther countries, such as China and India, have taken a more cautious approach and have placed restrictions on the use and trading of digital currencies. In the United States, digital currency regulations are still evolving, with different states and federal agencies taking different approaches.\\nThe U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued guidance on how existing regulations apply to digital currencies, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued guidance on how digital currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are considered securities.\\nFuture developments\\nAs the use of digital currencies continues to grow, government regulations and oversight will likely continue to evolve. Some experts predict that governments will eventually implement regulations to preven[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443123001324\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nImplications of central bank digital currency for financial stability: Evidence from the global banking sector - ScienceDirect\\nSkip to main contentSkip to article\\n\\n\\n\\nJournals & Books\\n\\n\\nHelp\\n\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n\\nMy account\\nSign in\\n\\nView\\u00a0PDF\\nDownload full issue\\n\\nSearch ScienceDirect\\n\\nJournal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money\\nVolume 89, December 2023, 101864\\n\\nImplications of central bank digital currency for financial stability: Evidence from the global banking sector\\nAuthor links open overlay panelHiep Ngoc Luu a, Canh Phuc Nguyen b, Muhammad Ali Nasir b c\\nShow more\\nAdd to Mendeley\\nShare\\nCite\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.intfin.2023.101864Get rights and content\\nUnder a Creative Commons license\\nopen access\\nHighlights\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nThe adoption of CBDC contributes to financial stability.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nA CBDC helps to reduce leverage and portfolio and asset risks.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nAdoption of a CBDC is found to be associated with increased lending.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nCBDC adoption has a more positive impact in emerging economies than in advanced economies.\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nRetail CBDC promotes stability, whereas wholesale CBDC hampers it.\\n\\n\\nAbstract\\nThis study analyses the implications of central bank digital currency (CBDC) for financial stability, specifically in the banking sector. Drawing on an international database on CBDC adoption, data on 1176 banks operating in 86 countries from 2010 to 2021 were used to construct a time-varying CBDC adoption index. Our key results suggest that the adoption of CBDC contributes to financial stability. Furthermore, bank size, capitalization, operational strategy, deposit funding and domestic investment also contribute positively while loan loss reserve negatively affects bank stability. These findings are robust to a comprehensive set of tests. We further find that CBDC helps to reduce leverage and asset risks. Other evidence suggests that the adoption of CBDC can be associated with expanded lending, increased asset quality and reduced loan loss reserves. However, the impact of CBDC is only pronounced for banks of reasonable size but not for smaller banks. Moreover, CBDC adoption appears to have a more positive impact in emerging economies than in advanced economies. Finally, retail CBDC is found to promote stability, whereas wholesale CBDC hampers it.

We\\u2019ll also explore how blockchain innovations, like\\u00a0Lightchain Tokens (LCAI), are paving the way for decentralized systems that could either complement or challenge the rise of CBDCs.\\nWhat are Central Bank Digital Currencies?\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital forms of a nation\\u2019s fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and represent a direct liability of the central bank, ensuring stability and trust.\\nThey are designed to complement physical cash, providing a digital alternative for transactions and payments. CBDCs can be categorized into two types. retail and wholesale. Retail CBDCs are intended for use by the general public, facilitating everyday transactions, while wholesale CBDCs are designed for financial institutions to streamline large-scale interbank transfers and settlements.\\nThe implementation of CBDCs aims to enhance payment efficiency, promote financial inclusion, and provide a secure, government-backed digital payment option. As of 2023, numerous central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting CBDCs to adapt to the evolving digital economy and maintain monetary sovereignty.\\nHow Do CBDCs Work?\\nEach country may have its own unique approach to implementing CBDCs, but in general, they work similarly to traditional fiat currencies. The main difference is that CBDCs are entirely digital and operate on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform. This allows for real-time, secure transactions, with the central bank acting as the intermediary.\\nConsumers can hold their CBDCs in digital wallets provided by commercial banks or directly through the central bank. Transactions using CBDCs can be conducted online or offline, making them easily accessible and convenient for everyday use.\\nCentral banks may also have control over the supply of CBDCs, allowing them to implement monetary policies more effectively. They may also have the ability to monitor transactions and combat illegal activities like money laundering.\\nThe Role of Lightchain AI in the CBDC Landscape\\nLightchain AI\\u00a0is poised to transform the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) landscape by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism enhances transaction security by validating operations through AI-driven computations, ensuring robust protection against fraud and cyber threats.\\nThe platform\\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) facilitates scalable solutions for centralized digital currencies, enabling efficient processing of high-volume transactions essential for CBDC implementation.\\nBy merging AI with blockchain,\\u00a0Lightchain AI offers\\u00a0a secure, scalable, and efficient framework for central banks exploring digital currency issuance, potentially revolutionizing the future of digital finance.\\nPotential Impact on Traditional Banking Systems\\nThe introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could significantly impact traditional banking systems. One primary concern is the potential for bank disintermediation, where customers might prefer holding funds in CBDCs over traditional bank deposits, perceiving them as safer or more convenient. This shift could reduce the deposit base of commercial banks, affecting their ability to lend and manage liquidity.\\nTo mitigate such risks, central banks might implement measures like limiting individual CBDC holdings or ensuring that CBDCs are non-interest-bearing, making them less attractive as a savings vehicle compared to bank deposits.\\nAdditionally, the coexistence of CBDCs and traditional bank money necessitates functional consistency to prevent fragmentation in payment systems. Establishing common operational characteristics across all forms of regulated digital money is essential to maintain stability and public confidence in the financial system.\\nLightchain Tokens (LCAI) A Disruptive Force in the CBDC Landscape\\nLightchain AI\\u00a0is a blockchain ecosystem that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance scalability, privacy, and decentralization.

A February 2025 Guide\\nContent:\\nChina's e-CNY is one of the biggest global CBDC experiments and is now expanding to Hong Kong.\\nAs digital transformation continues to reshape the financial landscape, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are emerging as a pivotal development. This article delves into what CBDCs are, their purpose, how they compare to traditional currencies andcryptocurrencies, and their advantages and challenges. By the end, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of CBDCs and their potential impact on the global economy.\\nA Central Bank Digital Currency is a digital form of a country's fiat currency issued by its central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and regulated by the government. They represent a digital equivalent of physical cash, aimed at modernizing the financial system and improving monetary policy efficiency. The concept of CBDCs has evolved over the years, driven by advancements in digital technology and the growing need for efficient payment systems.\\nThere has been alot of research doneon the benefits of shifting to digital payments. These benefits are also largely applicable to digital currencies like CBDCs. Digital payments tend to be cheaper, better and faster than physical cash transactions, which makes them instrumental for increasing financial inclusion and reducing transaction costs for individuals and businesses.\\nFor central banks, who are typically the organizations that are responsible for developing and launching CBDCs, CBDCs can help to maintain monetary sovereignty in the face of growing cryptocurrency usage and alternative digital payments. This was one of the key drivers behind China\\u2019s push to launch the e-CNY in the face of increasing competition from Alipay and WeChat Pay in the mainland China financial industry.\\nCBDCs offer the same functions as traditional currency but in a digital format. They can be used for payments, savings and investments, with the added benefits of reduced physical cash handling and improved transaction traceability.\\nMost CBDCs are accessed through adigital walleton a smartphone or device. Certain implementations of CBDCs like the e-CNY in China also provide for physical offline cards that can be used for contactless transactions, not unlike a traditional credit card. This format is particularly important where digital infrastructure is lacking as it allows for completely offline transactions.\\nCBDCs sit in the middle cash, federal reserves and bank accounts.\\n\\nUnlike decentralized cryptocurrencies likeBitcoinBitcoin, CBDCs are issued and regulated by central banks, ensuring stability and trust. CBDCs aim to combine the benefits of digital currencies with the reliability of traditional financial systems.\\nIn addition, as CBDCs are typically pegged 1:1 with traditional currencies, they don\\u2019t have the volatility that plagues most crypto-currencies as they are designed to be stable representations of traditional currency.\\nCBDCs can either be considered eitherwholesale or retail CBDCs.\\nRetail CBDCs are digital currencies available to the general public. They can be used for everyday transactions, similar to cash or bank deposits. Retail CBDCs aim to enhance financial inclusion by providing a digital payment option accessible to everyone.\\nWholesale CBDCs are intended for financial institutions and are used for interbank settlements and large-value transactions. They improve the efficiency and security of financial transactions between banks.\\nOne of the most significant advantages of CBDCs is the potential to enhance financial inclusion. In many parts of the world, a substantial portion of the population remains unbanked or underbanked, lacking access to traditional financial services. CBDCs can help ameliorate this by offering a digital payment method that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status.\\nThis can be particularly impactful in developing countries where banking infrastructure is limited. By enabling direct access to central bank funds, CBDCs can empower individuals and small businesses, fostering economic participation and reducing inequality.\\nCBDCs can also significantly reduce transaction costs for both consumers and businesses. Traditional payment systems often involve multiple intermediaries, each adding their own fees to the transaction process. CBDCs streamline this by enabling peer-to-peer transactions directly between parties without the need for intermediaries.\\nThis not only lowers costs but also speeds up transaction times. For businesses, especially those operating on tight margins, the reduction in transaction costs can translate into substantial savings, improving profitability and encouraging more efficient business operations.\\nSecurity is a critical concern in the digital age, and CBDCs offer enhanced security features compared to traditional cash and current digital payment systems. CBDCs leverage advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and protect against fraud. Unlike physical cash, which can be lost or stolen, digital currencies can be tracked and authenticated, reducing the risk of theft.\\nAdditionally, central banks can implement stringent security protocols and continuous monitoring to detect and prevent cyber threats. This enhanced security framework not only protects individual users but also contributes to the overall stability of the financial system.\\nTraditional banking systems can be slow, especially for cross-border transactions, which often take several days to settle. CBDCs can facilitate near-instantaneous transactions, both domestically and internationally. This increased speed can improve cash flow for businesses, reduce waiting times for consumers and enhance the overall efficiency of the financial system. Faster transaction speeds are particularly beneficial in emergency situations where immediate access to funds is crucial.\\nThe implementation of CBDCs raises significant privacy concerns. Unlike cash transactions, which are inherently private, digital transactions can be monitored and tracked by central authorities. This level of surveillance can lead to concerns about the erosion of personal privacy and the potential for misuse of transaction data.\\nFurthermore, the centralization of financial data in a CBDC system could create a single point of failure, making it an attractive target for cybercriminals. Ensuring that robust privacy protections and data security measures are in place will be crucial to addressing these concerns.\\nCBDCs are susceptible to cybersecurity threats, including hacking, digital fraud and other malicious activities. The digital nature of CBDCs means they require advanced security measures to protect against these threats.\\nCentral banks will need to invest heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and continuously update their systems to combat evolving threats. The risk of large-scale cyber attacks poses a significant challenge, as a successful breach could undermine trust in the entire financial system.\\nThe widespread adoption of CBDCs could disrupt existing financial systems. Traditional banks play a crucial role in the economy by providing loans and other financial services. If consumers and businesses move their deposits from commercial banks to CBDCs, it could reduce the banks' ability to lend, potentially leading to a credit crunch.\\nAdditionally, CBDCs could alter the dynamics of monetary policy. Central banks would have to manage the supply and demand of digital currency carefully to avoid inflation or deflation. The introduction of CBDCs could also impact international financial stability, as countries would need to navigate the complexities of cross-border digital currency transactions.\\nSeveral countries are at the forefront of CBDC adoption, each exploring different models and approaches. China, for example, has made significant strides with its e-CNY, and after conducting extensive pilot programs in major cities, the digital currency is now live across the country and increasingly overseas. These initiatives aim to modernize payment systems, enhance financial inclusion and increase the efficiency of transactions.\\nSimilarly, Sweden is testing the e-krona as part of its efforts to reduce the reliance on physical cash. These pilot programs provide valuable insights into the practical applications of CBDCs and highlight the benefits and challenges of digital currencies.\\nOther countries, such as the Bahamas with its Sand Dollar and Nigeria with its eNaira, have also launched their own CBDCs, focusing on improving financial access and economic resilience. The global trend towards CBDCs reflects a growing recognition of the need to innovate and adapt to the digital economy.\\nThe future of CBDCs looks promising, with the potential to revolutionize global economies by improving payment systems, enhancing financial inclusion and providing more efficient monetary policies. As more countries explore and adopt CBDCs, significant advancements in the digital currency landscape are expected.\\nCBDCs could lead to more resilient and inclusive financial systems, reducing the dependence on physical cash and traditional banking infrastructure. They may also foster greater innovation in financial services, driving the development of new payment solutions and financial products, especially as cross-border CBDC payment infrastructure improves.\\nHowever, the successful implementation of CBDCs will require addressing various challenges, including ensuring robust cybersecurity measures, protecting user privacy, and managing economic impacts. The collaboration between central banks, financial institutions and technology providers will be crucial in shaping the future of digital currencies.\\nCBDCs represent a significant shift in the way we perceive and use money. By understanding what CBDCs are, their benefits and the challenges they pose, we can better appreciate their potential impact on the future of finance.

They are designed for payment, store of value, and unit of account. They can offer various benefits, such as reducing transaction costs, increasing financial inclusion, and improving transparency and security.\\nOne of the critical areas where CBDCs have the potential to make a significant impact is monetary policy and financial stability. Monetary policy refers to the actions central banks take to regulate the money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives such as price stability and full employment. CBDCs could give central banks more significant control over the money supply and interest rates, allowing for more effective implementation of monetary policy.\\nSimilarly, CBDCs could also impact financial stability, which refers to the soundness and resilience of the financial system. CBDCs could potentially improve financial stability by reducing the risk of fraud and increasing transparency while also offering the potential for greater financial inclusion. However, there are also potential risks and challenges associated with CBDCs, which must be carefully considered and addressed to maximize their potential benefits.\\nMonetary policy refers to the actions taken by a central bank to regulate the money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives such as price stability and full employment. CBDCs could significantly impact monetary policy, given their digital nature and central banks\\u2019 control over issuance and circulation.\\nOne of the potential benefits of CBDCs for monetary policy is that they could give central banks more significant control over the money supply and interest rates. Because CBDCs are digital, they can be created and distributed more quickly and efficiently than physical currency, allowing central banks to respond more rapidly to changes in economic conditions. CBDCs could also enable central banks to implement more precise and targeted monetary policies since they could track money movement more closely and adjust interest rates more quickly.\\nAnother potential benefit of CBDCs for monetary policy is enabling central banks to implement negative interest rates more quickly. Negative interest rates refer to a situation where depositors are charged to keep their money in a bank rather than earning interest on their deposits. This is a tool that central banks have used in the past to stimulate spending and investment during periods of economic weakness. Still, it can take time to implement effectively using physical currency. However, with CBDCs, negative interest rates could be implemented more quickly since central banks could adjust the interest rate on CBDC balances.\\nHowever, there are also potential challenges associated with implementing CBDCs in conjunction with other monetary policy tools. For example, if CBDCs become widely adopted, they could crowd out different forms of money, such as bank deposits or physical currency. This could have unintended consequences for monetary policy and financial stability, requiring careful management and coordination by central banks. Additionally, introducing CBDCs could require significant changes to the existing monetary policy framework, which must be carefully considered and communicated to ensure a smooth transition.\\nFinancial stability refers to the soundness and resilience of the financial system and is essential in preventing financial crises that can have widespread economic consequences. CBDCs could significantly impact financial stability, given their digital nature and potential for greater transparency and security.\\nOne of the potential benefits of CBDCs for financial stability is that they could offer greater transparency and reduce the risk of fraud. CBDCs would be issued and backed by a central bank, which would provide greater assurance to users that their funds are safe and secure. Additionally, CBDC transactions could be recorded on a blockchain, potentially providing greater transparency and traceability than traditional financial transactions.\\nAnother potential benefit of CBDCs for financial stability is that they could offer greater financial inclusion. CBDCs would be accessible to anyone with a smartphone or internet connection, which could provide payment and financial access to individuals who traditional financial institutions currently underserve. This could reduce inequality and promote economic growth.\\nHowever, there are also potential challenges related to privacy and security concerns associated with CBDCs. Since CBDC transactions would be recorded on a blockchain, there could be concerns about the privacy and security of user data. Additionally, there could be concerns about the potential for cyber attacks or other security breaches that could compromise the integrity of the CBDC system.\\nTo ensure that CBDCs contribute to financial stability, it will be necessary to consider these potential risks and challenges carefully and to develop appropriate safeguards and regulatory frameworks to mitigate them. This will require collaboration and coordination between central banks, financial regulators, and other stakeholders to ensure that CBDCs are introduced responsibly and sustainably.\\nWhile CBDCs offer potential benefits for monetary policy and financial stability, some risks and challenges must be considered. These include:\\nDisintermediation and potential impact on banks: CBDCs have the potential to disrupt the traditional banking system by allowing users to hold and transact directly with the central bank. This could lead to disintermediation, where banks lose deposits and become less able to provide credit to the economy. This could have unintended consequences for monetary policy and financial stability, requiring careful management by central banks.\\nCybersecurity risks: CBDCs are digital assets and are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other forms of digital fraud. Any system that handles CBDCs must be robustly secured and regularly tested to minimize the risk of theft or fraud. Additionally, introducing CBDCs could require significant investments in cybersecurity infrastructure to ensure the system is secure and resilient.\\nPotential for increased volatility in financial markets: CBDCs could introduce new volatility sources into financial markets. For example, if CBDCs are issued faster than physical currency, this could lead to inflation and changes in exchange rates. Additionally, introducing CBDCs could lead to changes in the demand for other forms of money, such as bank deposits or physical currency, which could have unintended consequences for financial stability.\\nTo minimize these potential risks and challenges, it will be necessary for central banks and other stakeholders to carefully consider the implications of CBDCs for monetary policy and financial stability and to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks and risk management strategies to mitigate these risks. This will require collaboration and coordination between central banks, financial regulators, and other stakeholders and a commitment to ensuring that CBDCs are introduced responsibly and sustainably.\\nIn conclusion, CBDCs have the potential to significantly impact monetary policy and financial stability, offering benefits such as greater control over the money supply and increased transparency and financial inclusion while also introducing potential risks such as disintermediation and cybersecurity risks. As such, the development and implementation of CBDCs must be approached with careful consideration and planning.\\nCentral banks and other stakeholders must work together to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks, risk management strategies, and cybersecurity infrastructure to mitigate the potential risks associated with CBDCs. This will require a collaborative effort to ensure CBDCs are introduced responsibly and sustainably, focusing on maximizing benefits while minimizing risks.\\nWhile introducing CBDCs will undoubtedly present challenges, it also offers an opportunity to enhance the financial system\\u2019s efficiency, security, and inclusiveness. With careful planning and coordination, CBDCs could strengthen monetary policy and financial stability and promote more significant economic growth and prosperity.\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-macroeconomic-implications-of-cbdc-a-review-of-the-literature.htm\\nTitle: The Fed - The Macroeconomic Implications of CBDC: A Review of the Literature\\nContent:\\nNovember 2022\\nSebastian Infante,Kyungmin Kim,Anna Orlik,Andr\\u00e9 F. Silva, andRobert J. Tetlow\\nAbstract:\\nThis paper provides an overview of the literature examining how the introduction of a CBDC would affect the banking sector, financial stability, and the implementation and transmission of monetary policy in a developed economy such as the United States. A CBDC has the potential to improve welfare by reducing financial frictions in deposit markets, by boosting financial inclusion, and by improving the transmission of monetary policy. However, a CBDC also entails noteworthy risks, including the possibility of bank disintermediation and associated contraction in bank credit, as well as potential adverse effects on financial stability. A CBDC also raise important questions regarding monetary policy implementation and the footprint of central banks in the financial system. Ultimately, the effects of a CBDC depend critically on its design features, particularly remuneration.\\nKeywords:Financial stability, Monetary policy, banking, central bank digital currency, central banking\\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2022.076\\nPDF:Full Paper\\nRelated Materials:Accessible materials (.zip)\\nDisclaimer:The economic research that is linked from this page represents the views of the authors and does not indicate concurrence either by other members of the Board's staff or by the Board of Governors.

As central banks globally explore the possibilities of CBDCs, their progress, challenges, and potential impact on traditional banking are subjects of significant interest and debate.\\nProgress in CBDC Development:\\nSeveral central banks around the world are actively researching and experimenting with CBDCs. China, with its Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) project, has made substantial strides, piloting CBDCs in various cities and testing their application in real-world scenarios. Other countries, including the United States, the European Union, and Japan, are also exploring the development of CBDCs, each with its unique approach and considerations.\\nThe potential benefits of CBDCs include increased efficiency in payment systems, enhanced financial inclusion, and the ability for central banks to have more direct control over monetary policy. However, these advantages come with their own set of challenges and considerations.\\nChallenges in CBDC Implementation:\\nTechnological Infrastructure: Developing a secure and scalable technological infrastructure is a primary challenge in CBDC implementation. The distributed ledger technology (DLT) or blockchain, often considered for CBDCs, must accommodate large transaction volumes while ensuring robust security measures to prevent cyber threats.\\nPrivacy Concerns: CBDCs raise concerns about privacy, as digital transactions can potentially be traced more easily than traditional cash transactions. Striking a balance between privacy and regulatory oversight is crucial to ensure public trust in the new digital currency.\\nCross-Border Compatibility: For CBDCs to realize their full potential, they need to be interoperable across borders. This requires international cooperation and the development of common standards to facilitate cross-border transactions seamlessly.\\nImpact on Commercial Banks: The introduction of CBDCs may disrupt the traditional banking sector. If consumers opt to hold CBDCs directly with the central bank, it could reduce the amount of funds held in commercial banks, impacting their ability to lend and potentially altering the dynamics of the traditional banking system.\\nPotential Impact on Traditional Banking:\\nChanging the Payments Landscape: CBDCs have the potential to revolutionize the payments landscape by offering a faster, more efficient, and cost-effective alternative to traditional payment systems. This could lead to a decline in the use of physical cash and traditional banking services for day-to-day transactions.\\nFinancial Inclusion: CBDCs can address issues of financial inclusion by providing a digital currency accessible to individuals who may not have access to traditional banking services. This can bridge the gap between the banked and unbanked populations, fostering greater economic participation.\\nMonetary Policy Tools: CBDCs grant central banks more direct control over monetary policy. With the ability to implement negative interest rates or distribute funds directly to citizens, central banks can respond more effectively to economic challenges. However, this also requires careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences.\\nCommercial Banks' Role Redefined: The introduction of CBDCs may redefine the role of commercial banks. If consumers can hold digital currency directly with the central bank, traditional banks may need to adapt their business models, potentially focusing more on value-added services rather than serving as custodians of deposits.\\nConclusion:\\nAs central banks advance in their exploration and implementation of CBDCs, the financial landscape is on the brink of significant transformation. The progress made in CBDC development is a testament to the potential benefits these digital currencies could bring, from increased efficiency to financial inclusion. However, the challenges, including technological hurdles, privacy concerns, and the potential impact on traditional banking, must be navigated carefully.\\n*Join our WhatsApp Channel to get the latest news, exclusives and videos on WhatsApp*\\n_____________\\nDisclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

It suggests policy options, including careful CBDC design, to mitigate these risks and balance the benefits with financial stability.\\nThe IMF Working Paper authored by Romain Bouis, Gaston Gelos, Paavo Miettinen, Fumitaka Nakamura, Erlend Nier, and Gabriel Soderberg, from the International Monetary Fund\\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets department, examines the implications of retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on financial stability. This detailed study looks at how the issuance of a CBDC to the general public could impact the balance sheets of both central banks and commercial banks, with a particular focus on the risks and opportunities this transition might present. The authors highlight that the financial stability effects of CBDCs depend on several key factors, including the size of the issuance, the initial conditions of the financial system, and how both banks and central banks react. Through scenario analysis, the paper explores how balance sheets might change in different environments, whether under normal conditions or during crises, and the potential impacts on financial stability.\\nRisks to Financial Intermediation\\nOne of the central concerns raised in the paper is that the issuance of CBDCs could lead to disruptions in the traditional banking system, particularly in terms of financial intermediation. The scenarios outlined in the study suggest that if CBDCs replace a significant portion of commercial bank deposits, the banking system could face challenges in maintaining stable and low-cost funding. This is particularly true when commercial banks do not have excess reserves to absorb the demand for CBDCs, forcing central banks to expand their balance sheets by providing more reserves. In such cases, banks may need to rely on more costly or volatile wholesale funding, which could lead to higher lending costs and reduce the overall availability of credit to businesses and consumers. Additionally, during periods of financial stress, there is a risk of \\\"digital bank runs,\\\" where depositors rapidly move their funds from traditional banks into CBDCs, exacerbating liquidity crises.\\nImpact on Bank Profitability and Lending\\nThe paper also discusses the potential consequences of CBDC adoption on banks' profitability. As banks lose cheaper deposit funding and are forced to replace it with more expensive central bank or wholesale funding, their profitability could decline. This, in turn, could lead to increased risk-taking as banks try to maintain profit margins, or it could prompt a reduction in lending to the private sector, which would have negative implications for economic growth. The authors argue that these risks are particularly pronounced when CBDC adoption is rapid or occurs during a financial crisis, as banks may struggle to adjust to the new environment in which deposits are being diverted into digital currencies.\\nMacroprudential Policies and Central Bank Lending\\nIn exploring potential policy responses to these challenges, the paper suggests several options that central banks and regulators might consider. One possibility is to adjust macroprudential policies to account for the new risks introduced by CBDCs, such as tightening capital and liquidity requirements for banks. However, the authors note that macroprudential policies alone are unlikely to be sufficient to fully mitigate the risks associated with CBDC issuance. Another potential solution is to expand central bank lending to the commercial banking system, particularly during times of stress. By providing additional liquidity through mechanisms such as longer-term refinancing operations, central banks could help ensure that banks have the necessary funding to continue lending, even if they face significant deposit outflows due to CBDC adoption.\\nDesigning CBDCs to Mitigate Risks\\nNevertheless, the most promising approach, according to the study, is to carefully design CBDCs in a way that limits their potential to disrupt the banking system. Specifically, the authors advocate for CBDC designs that encourage their use as a means of payment rather than as a store of value. This could be achieved through features such as imposing limits on the amount of CBDC individuals can hold or offering zero or negative interest rates on CBDC balances. These design choices would help prevent large-scale shifts of deposits from commercial banks into CBDCs, thereby reducing the risk of financial instability. Moreover, ensuring interoperability between CBDCs and traditional bank-operated payment systems could further mitigate these risks by allowing for a smoother integration of CBDCs into the existing financial system.\\nBalancing Benefits with Financial Stability\\nThe paper concludes by emphasizing that while CBDCs offer several potential benefits such as reducing the costs of producing and handling cash, improving financial inclusion, and enhancing the efficiency of payment systems these benefits must be weighed against the potential risks to financial stability. The authors argue that without careful consideration of these risks, CBDCs could lead to significant disruptions in the banking system, particularly if they are widely adopted in a short period of time or during times of economic stress. Therefore, central banks must carefully design CBDCs and consider a range of policy tools to ensure that their introduction does not inadvertently harm the broader financial system.\\n TRENDING \\n OPINION / BLOG / INTERVIEW \\n DevShots \\n Latest News \\n\\n\\r\\n                    Controversy Over Early Leave for Ramzan Sparks Political Debate in Telangana\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                    Delhi Sessions Court Stays Magistrate Order Over FIR Against Police in 2020 Riots Case\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                    Honda Achieves 2-Crore Milestone in Southern India\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                    City's Markets to Shine: Night Sweeping Initiative Launched\\r\\n                \\n\\n Connect us on \\n Email: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15 \\n\\u00a9 Copyright 2025\\n\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://fxpredator.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdcs/\\nTitle: None\\nContent:\\nThe Pros and Cons of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\\nFXPredator\\n\\u00b7\\n\\u00b7\\nTable of Contents\\nCBDCs: Exploring the Digital Divide of Centralized Control\\nIntroduction\\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital forms of fiat currencies issued and regulated by central banks.

        "value": "The introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is poised to significantly impact the traditional banking system and financial stability over the next five years. Several factors underscore this potential transformation, including changes in consumer behavior, alterations to financial institutions' business models, and implications for monetary policy and financial stability.\n\n### Impact on Traditional Banking Systems\n\n1. **Disintermediation and Consumer Behavior**: CBDCs may encourage consumers to hold their funds directly with central banks instead of commercial banks, which could lead to disintermediation. This shift means fewer deposits for traditional banks, affecting their ability to provide loans and manage liquidity effectively. If consumers perceive CBDCs as safer and more convenient, this could exacerbate existing challenges for banks, particularly smaller institutions that lack substantial capital reserves to absorb such changes (https://www.currencyinsider.com).\n\n2. **Revenue Challenges for Banks**: As CBDCs might reduce the transaction fees banks currently earn from payment processes, traditional banking revenue sources could dwindle. Banks may need to adapt their business models, focusing more on value-added services rather than solely relying on custodianship of deposits. This adaptation may challenge existing banks to identify new revenue streams while facing potential profitability declines (https://www.analyticsinsight.net).\n\n3. **Changes in Payment Systems**: The efficiency of CBDCs in facilitating faster, cheaper transactions could lead to a general shift in payment preferences. With lower transaction costs and improved processing times, consumers might prefer using CBDCs for both everyday transactions and larger financial transfers, potentially diminishing the relevance of traditional banking services (https://www.digipay.guru).\n\n### Financial Stability Implications\n\n1. **Enhanced Financial Stability**: CBDCs can promote financial stability by improving transparency and offering a safer alternative to private cryptocurrencies. For instance, CBDCs issued by central banks are backed by state authority, which provides assurance against fraud (https://www.imf.org). Studies indicate that well-designed CBDCs could reduce leverage and associated risks in the banking sector, particularly in emerging economies (https://www.sciencedirect.com).\n\n2. **Regulatory and Monetary Policy Changes**: The adoption of CBDCs allows central banks to have direct control over the money supply and implement monetary policies more effectively. This capability includes potential measures such as direct monetary relief through CBDC distributions in times of economic distress, thereby enhancing the agility of central banks in responding to economic changes (https://www.forbes.com). However, if CBDCs are designed to replace a significant portion of bank deposits, it could risk limiting the effectiveness of traditional monetary policy tools (https://www.macroeconomic implications).\n\n3. **Cybersecurity Risks and Stability**: While CBDCs enhance security through advanced technology, they also carry cybersecurity risks. A successful cyber attack on CBDC infrastructure could undermine public trust in the entire financial system, prompting bank runs or rapid shifts of deposits to CBDCs during crises (https://www.fxpredator.com). Thus, the design and implementation of robust cybersecurity measures will be crucial in maintaining financial stability as CBDCs are rolled out (https://www.devdiscourse.com).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOver the next five years, the introduction of CBDCs is expected to challenge the traditional banking system by altering consumer behavior and revenue dynamics, necessitating an adaptation by financial institutions. Simultaneously, CBDCs hold the potential to enhance financial stability through improved transparency and the ability to implement effective monetary policies. However, to achieve these benefits, central banks will need to carefully consider the design features of CBDCs, address cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and potentially implement regulations to mitigate risks of disintermediation. This balancing act will be vital to harnessing the full potential of CBDCs while safeguarding the integrity of the financial system."

The experiences of China e-CNY deployment have raised interesting research questions on central bank digital currency that deserve further investigation.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: GlobalData Survey Reveals Challenges in Consumer Adoption of CBDCs\\nURL: https://defi-planet.com/2025/01/globaldata-survey-reveals-challenges-in-consumer-adoption-of-cbdcs/\\nCONTENT: Crypto Crypto Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are facing challenges in adoption, even in countries where they have been officially launched. Blandina Szalay, a banking and payments analyst at GlobalData, attributes the limited adoption of CBDCs in countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, and Nigeria to the absence of compelling incentives for consumers to transition from traditional payment methods. Meanwhile, a September 2024 report from the Atlantic Council revealed that 134 countries, covering 98% of the global economy, are exploring CBDCs. Over 65 nations, including India, Australia, and Brazil, are in the advanced stages of piloting or launching digital currency projects. \\u201cTake control of your crypto portfolio with MARKETS PRO, DeFi Planet\\u2019s suite of analytics tools.\\u201d Crypto Crypto Crypto\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Central bank digital currencies: Consumer data-driven sustainable ...\\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523005528\\nCONTENT: It assesses if CBDC policy should be guided by consumer data.

The IMF Working Paper authored by Romain Bouis, Gaston Gelos, Paavo Miettinen, Fumitaka Nakamura, Erlend Nier, and Gabriel Soderberg, from the International Monetary Fund\\u2019s Monetary and Capital Markets department, examines the implications of retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on financial stability. The authors highlight that the financial stability effects of CBDCs depend on several key factors, including the size of the issuance, the initial conditions of the financial system, and how both banks and central banks react. One of the central concerns raised in the paper is that the issuance of CBDCs could lead to disruptions in the traditional banking system, particularly in terms of financial intermediation.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: What Risks Are Associated with CBDCs? - cbdcstrategies.com\\nURL: https://cbdcstrategies.com/what-risks-are-associated-with-cbdc/\\nCONTENT: Though there are a lot of advantages that come with CBDCs, there are also setbacks that central banks and policymakers should deal with. Such are some of the highlighted risks in the issuance and use of CBDCs: 1. Financial Stability Risks. The establishment of CBDC could bring radical changes in the financial structures that exist today.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Financial Stability: How CBDCs Can Mitigate Economic Risks\\nURL: https://fastercapital.com/content/Financial-Stability--How-CBDCs-Can-Mitigate-Economic-Risks.html\\nCONTENT: 4. CBDCs can promote financial stability: Central bank Digital currencies (CBDCs) have the potential to promote financial stability by providing a secure and stable form of digital currency.

According to the report, more than 90 per cent of central banks currently engage in some form of CBDC work, and around two-thirds of central banks consider that they were likely to or might possibly issue a retail CBDC in either the short or medium term. Avoiding the \\u201cDigital Bank Run: In times of financial stress, CBDCs might become a safer haven than commercial bank deposits, enabling rapid fund transfers and potentially triggering a \\u201cdigital bank run.\\u201d To mitigate this, central banks need to design CBDCs that emphasise transactional use rather than long-term holding.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: A literature review on the design and implementation of central bank ...\\nURL: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42495-023-00125-9\\nCONTENT: Next category deals with the mainstream theoretical research on the potential macro policy and financial stability implications of CBDCs; yet also extends into alternative topics, such as the indispensable role of central bank money in payment networks,Footnote 1 currency competition, and private and public money coexistence schemes. Besides the functional monetary policy improvements purported by macro policy and financial stability research, most of the expected benefits of introducing CBDCs need more evidence to make a winning case for central bank digital currencies. Alternative literature partly focuses on the practical results from regulatory preparations and adoption challenges, while some scholars study relevant historical arguments for CBDCs. The socioeconomic impact of the digitalization of money, currency competition between private and public money, and direct access to central bank liabilities are vital themes that researchers focus on to bridge past research with the recent rise of digital currencies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: PDF\\nURL: https://www.bis.org/review/r221031j.pdf\\nCONTENT: Thus the challenges of the economic of cbdc require a) the analysis the potential impact on the role of supervised financial intermediaries and on the transmission of monetary policy and financial stability and b) the ability to meet the end-user needs including privacy issues and the integration with existing retail payment schemes/systems; The introduction of a CBDC can influence the transmission of monetary policy and financial stability through several channels that are mainly related to the substitution of commercial bank deposits with a public digital currency.

This study analyses the implications of central bank digital currency (CBDC) for financial stability, specifically in the banking sector. Drawing on an international database on CBDC adoption, data on 1176 banks operating in 86 countries from 2010 to 2021 were used to construct a time-varying CBDC adoption index. Our key results suggest that the adoption of CBDC contributes to financial stability. Next article in issue CBDC No articles found.

However, a key objective of this scenario analysis is to consider how the potential effects on financial stability depend not only on the amount of the CBDC being issued, but also on preconditions, in terms of the structure of the balance sheets of the central bank, and the commercial banking sector, as well as on second-round effects from competitive reactions by the commercial banking sector to the issuance of the CBDC.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: PDF\\nURL: https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/policy-hub/2022/06/01/06--should-us-issue-central-bank-digital-currency.pdf\\nCONTENT: Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Policy Hub \\u2022 No. 2022-6 2 Should the US Issue a Central Bank Digital Currency?
