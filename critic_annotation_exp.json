This event prompted Washington to reassess its strategic interactions, resulting in reduced political and military engagement with Russia and the suspension of the Bilateral Presidential Commission, a framework established to encourage dialogue between the two nations <cite>https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-russia/</cite>. The diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Russia date back to the early 19th century, with formal recognition established in 1809. Despite a history of cooperation, notably during post-Soviet integration efforts after 1991, the partnership has been fraught with geopolitical tensions, such as Russia’s continued aggression in Ukraine and Georgia <cite>https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-russia/</cite>.",

The risk of conflict escalation remains high, influenced by military confrontations and cyber incidents that shape bilateral interactions.

Following the Soviet Union’s dissolution in 1991, there was hope for a partnership founded on shared interests and mutual benefits.

This optimism manifested in cooperative frameworks under President George H.W.
