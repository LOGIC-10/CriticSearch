(AP Photo/Baraa Anwer)\nRIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 Top Russian and U.S. officials are set to hold talks hold talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday in a bid to improve their ties and negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.\nThe meeting between the two countries' top diplomats in Riyadh would be their most significant since the Russia invaded its neighbor almost three years ago, and is meant to pave the way for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTrump earlier this month upended U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia, saying he and Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov arrived in the Saudi capital on Monday night. Ushakov said the talks would be \u201cpurely bilateral\u201d and would not include Ukrainian officials.\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff will meet the Russian delegation, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.\nThe recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won\u2019t be favorable to them. France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to decide how to respond.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday his country won\u2019t accept the outcome if Kyiv doesn\u2019t take part.\nU.S.-Russia talks would \u201cyield no results\u201d without Ukrainian officials, Zelenskyy said on a conference call with journalists from the United Arab Emirates.\nAhead of the talks, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund who the Kremlin said might join the meeting, underscored the importance of the meeting in comments to The Associated Press.\n\u201cGood U.S.-Russia relations are very important for the whole world. Only jointly can Russia and the U.S. address lots of world problems, resolve for global conflicts and offer solutions,\u201d Dmitriev, who said he and his team would focus on economic issues at the talks, told AP.\nREAD:\nThe 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents\nThe Saudi-owned satellite channel Al Arabiya, citing the Russian delegation, described Moscow\u2019s priority as \u201creal normalization with Washington.\u201d\nFor Saudi Arabia, the talks are a major step toward a goal de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has pursued throughout the war \u2014 putting the kingdom in the middle of diplomatic negotiations. It has helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in the kingdom in 2023. Zelenskyy will likely travel to Saudi Arabia later this week.\nFor Prince Mohammed, once described as a \u201cpariah\u201d by former President Joe Biden over the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, hosting such talks burnish the otherwise-tarnished image the West has for him. Like\nAhead of the summit, the Saudi daily newspaper Okaz described the moment as the \u201cworld\u2019s eye on Riyadh.\u201d\nWriting in the London-based but Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq Al Awsat, journalist Mishari al-Dhaidi described the summit as \"a major step on the international political chess arena, revealing the status of Saudi Arabia and its positive influence for the benefit of the people all the people,\u201d he wrote. the neighboring United Arab Emirates, the prince also has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine, both through the OPEC+ oil cartel and diplomatically as well.\nHosting the summit also balances the harsh criticism recently levied by the kingdom's tightly controlled media at President Donald Trump over his repeated comments that he wants the U.S. to \u201cown\u201d the Gaza Strip, which has been devastated by the Israeli military offensive there since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The Palestinians want Gaza and the West Bank for a future state, something backed by the wider Arab world and nearly all of the international community.\n___\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

He said repeatedly that Ukraine\u2019s leaders never should have allowed the war to begin, suggesting the country should have been willing to make concessions to Russia before the 2022 invasion.\n\u201cToday I heard, \u2018Oh, well, we weren\u2019t invited.\u2019 Well, you been there for three years. You should have ended it three years\u201d ago, Trump said during a news conference at his Florida residence. \u201cYou should have never started it. You could have made a deal.\u201d\nImproving Russian-US relations\nTies between Russia and the U.S. have fallen to their lowest level in decades in recent years \u2014 a rift that has been widening ever since Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and only worsened after Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion.\nThe U.S., along with European nations, imposed a raft of sanctions on Russia in an effort to damage its economy. And embassies in Washington and Moscow have been hit hard by expulsions of large numbers of diplomats, as well as other restrictions.\nRubio said Tuesday that ending the war in Ukraine could \u201cunlock the door\u201d for \u201cincredible opportunities\u201d to partner with the Russians on issues of common interest \u201cthat hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term.\u201d\nHis comments were further evidence of the remarkable U.S. reversal on Russia after years in which Trump\u2019s predecessor, Joe Biden, led international efforts to isolate Moscow.\nTuesday\u2019s meeting was meant to pave the way for a summit between Trump and Putin. After the talks ended, Ushakov and Waltz said no date has been set yet for that summit. Ushakov told Russian television that a meeting was \u201cunlikely\u201d to take place next week, while Waltz said he thought it could be arranged in the coming weeks.\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, Lavrov mentioned the same three goals as Rubio and said that Washington and Moscow agreed to appoint representatives to carry out \u201cregular consultations\u201d on Ukraine.\n\u201cI have reason to believe that the American side has started to better understand our position\u201d the Russian foreign minister said.\nThe meeting marked the most extensive contact between the two countries since Moscow\u2019s Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. Lavrov and then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked briefly on the sidelines of a G-20 meeting in India nearly two years ago, but tensions remained high.\nConcerns from allies they are being sidelined\nThe recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Ukraine and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won\u2019t be favorable to them.\nKyiv\u2019s absence at Tuesday\u2019s talks rankled many Ukrainians, and France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to discuss the war. Kyiv\u2019s participation in such talks was a bedrock of U.S. policy under Biden.\nU.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said the talks were aimed at determining how serious the Russians are about achieving peace and whether detailed negotiations can start.\nRubio said Tuesday that there would be \u201cengagement and consultation with Ukraine, with our partners in Europe and others. But ultimately, the Russian side will be indispensable to this effort.\u201d\nRubio also said ending the conflict would require concessions from all sides and that Washington \u201cis not going to predetermine\u201d what those concessions would be.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia \u2014 two key items on Putin\u2019s wish list.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Trump and Zelenskyy following Monday\u2019s European meeting.\n\u201cWe seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,\u201d Macron wrote on social media platform X. \u201cTo achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,\u201d he said and vowed to \u201cwork on this together with all Europeans, Americans and Ukrainians.\u201d\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s role\nThe meeting at the Diriyah Palace in the Saudi capital of Riyadh also highlighted de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s efforts to be a major diplomatic player, burnishing a reputation severely tarnished by the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nSaudi state media described the talks as happening at the prince\u2019s direction. Like the neighboring United Arab Emirates, the prince has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine, both through the OPEC+ oil cartel and diplomatically as well.\nSaudi Arabia has also helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in 2023.\nBut Zelenskyy postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the talks since Ukrainian officials weren\u2019t invited. His visit was rescheduled for March 10.\nWar continues\nMeanwhile, Russia continued to pummel Ukraine with drones, according to Kyiv\u2019s military. The Ukrainian air force said Russian troops launched a barrage of 176 drones at Ukraine overnight, most of which were destroyed or disabled by jamming.\nOne Russian drone struck a residential building in Dolynska in the Kirovohrad region, wounding a mother and her two children and prompting an evacuation of 38 apartments, the regional administration reported.\n___\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

The meeting marked the first time top-level US and Russian officials had met face to face since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and they marked a complete reversal of policy from that of the Biden administration.\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nThe US delegation, which included Rubio as well as the US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, suggested that this would be the first in a series of engagements to bring the war to an end.\nAsked if the US would be willing to accept Russia retaining any of the territory it had annexed from Ukraine since February 2022, Waltz said it was something \u201dto be discussed.\u201d\n\u201cWe know just the practical reality is that there is going to be some discussion of territory and there\u2019s going to be discussion of security guarantees. Those are just fundamental basics that will undergird and underlie any type of discussion,\u201d Waltz said.\nRussia has previously demanded that Ukraine must cede control of large swaths of its territory and give up its ambition to join NATO \u2013 conditions Kyiv previously rejected. But with no seat at the table in Riyadh, Ukraine was left to watch from afar as the US and Russia appeared to set out their initial positions.\n President Donald Trump speaks as Tulsi Gabbard is sworn in as the Director of National Intelligence in the Oval Office on February 12, 2025, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP Related article Trump\u2019s rush for a deal with Putin leaves Ukraine and Europe scrambling\nThe announcement that Washington and Moscow would begin in-person talks, just days after US President Donald Trump held a 90-minute phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, sparked panic in Ukraine and amid Kyiv\u2019s Western allies.\nEuropean leaders even held an emergency summit on Monday, reiterating that no peace talks can happen without Ukraine and its European allies having a seat at the table.\nWaltz pushed back on the idea that Europe and Ukraine had been sidelined, while Rubio appeared at pains to stress that any agreement will include Ukraine. And while the US delegation did suggest Ukraine might have to give up territory, Rubio said that in order for the war to end \u201ceveryone involved in that conflict has to be okay with it.\u201d\nSpeaking after the talks, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine would not \u201cgive in to Russia\u2019s ultimatums.\u201d\n\u201cRussia attacked Ukraine and we had no choice but to take up arms and defend ourselves. And there was no diplomacy because Russia attacked, attacked Ukraine at night and Ukrainians took up arms and started to defend their country,\u201d Zelensky said at a news conference in Turkey\u2019s capital Ankara.\nZelensky added that he was postponing his planned visit to Saudi Arabia in light of the talks that took place there on Tuesday.\nTalks mark end to Russia\u2019s isolation\nRussia has been excluded from global diplomacy since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Tuesday\u2019s meeting in Riyadh \u2013 which went ahead despite Russia launching an extensive drone attack on Ukraine just hours ahead of their start \u2013 appeared to mark an end of this isolation.\nRussia\u2019s Lavrov called the meeting \u201cvery useful.\u201d\n\u201cWe not only listened, but also heard each other,\u201d Lavrov said Tuesday.\nThe two sides have agreed to reestablish diplomatic communication, with Rubio going as far as saying that \u201cextraordinary opportunities\u201d could be available for both the US and Russia if the war in Ukraine ends.\nRubio said the US could \u201cpartner with the Russians geopolitically on issues of common interest and, frankly, economically.\u201d\nWitkoff, meanwhile, described the meeting as \u201cpositive, upbeat, constructive.\u201d\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have imagined a better result after this session, it was very, very solid,\u201d Witkoff said.\nRussia demands territory, Zelensky\u2019s ouster\nNeither the US nor the Russian officials gave any indication whether they discussed in detail what, if any, concessions Russia and Ukraine might be willing to make to bring the conflict to an end.\nBut the Russian ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya outlined Moscow\u2019s key demands ahead of the talks. Many of them will likely be seen in Kyiv as unacceptable.\nSpeaking at a UN Security Council meeting on Monday, Nebenzya said that Russia wants Ukraine to cede control of the entirety of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, saying these places and Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula Russia illegally annexed in 2014, were \u201cirrevocably lost.\u201d\nHe incorrectly claimed that the regions had \u201cjoined the Russian Federation,\u201d referring to referenda that were held by Russian-installed authorities across the occupied areas, widely denounced as shams by Ukraine and its Western allies.\nAccording to the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, Russia currently occupies about 99% of the Luhansk region, 70% of the Donetsk region, and roughly 75% of both the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Nebenzya said that the peace negotiations should \u201ccorrect\u201d this situation, insisting that Ukraine give up control of the parts of the four regions not under Russian occupation.\nNebenzya also made it clear that Russia wants to force Zelensky out of office. The Russian ambassador called Zelensky \u201cthe self-proclaimed Ukrainian president\u201d and referred to his government as \u201cthe Zelensky cabal,\u201d saying that neither had \u201ca role to play in the new Ukraine.\u201d\nZelensky won the second round of Ukraine\u2019s 2019 presidential election in a landslide. His mandate should have ended last May, but he remains in office because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia launched its full-scale invasion and martial law prohibits holding elections.\nNebenzya also said that Ukraine should be a \u201cdemilitarized, neutral state, not a part of any blocs or alliances.\u201d Ukraine has long insisted on joining NATO in the future and the defense alliance has said the door is open to any country that wishes to join, as long as it fulfills the admission criteria.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Lavrov said that Russia would not accept troops from

seizure of Crimea, and two-and-a-half years after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, Ukraine continues to fight for its independence against its much larger and nuclear-armed neighbor. The next U.S. administration and Congress will confront a continuing war in Europe along with pressing challenges from China to the Middle East and Mexico. How should the next administration adjust U.S. policy toward Ukraine, attempt to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end, and resolve the question of NATO membership for Kyiv? How can it best work with its NATO allies and others to handle the challenge of a revisionist Russia and ensure European and American security? How should the United States and Europe aid in rebuilding Ukraine?\nOn Thursday, September 12, the Brookings Foreign Policy program, in partnership with the World Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth and DBU\u2019s Institute for Global Engagement, hosted a panel discussion with Brookings Senior Fellows Fiona Hill and Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller as well as George W. Bush Institute Executive Director David J. Kramer to consider how the United States will manage its policies toward and relationships with Europe, Ukraine, and Russia going forward. Audience Q&A followed the discussion.\nViewers submitted questions via email to events@brookings.edu and via X (Twitter) to @BrookingsFP using #Ukraine.\nThis event is a part of\u00a0Brookings\u2019 Election \u201924: Issues at Stake, an initiative aimed to bring public attention to consequential policy issues confronting voters and policymakers in the run up to the 2024 election. This includes equipping leaders with insights and policy ideas to help them govern in 2025 and beyond.\nIn Partnership With\nWorld Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth\n\nWorld Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth\nThe Institute for Global Engagement\n\nThe Institute for Global Engagement\nAgenda\n\n\nSeptember 12\n\n\n### Introduction\n\nLiz Brailsford President and CEO - World Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth\n\nJonathan Fechner Executive Director, Institute for Global Engagement - Dallas Baptist University\n\n\n### Panel discussion\n\nFiona Hill Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center on the United States and Europe\n\nConstanze Stelzenm\u00fcller Director - Center on the United States and Europe, Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center on the United States and Europe, Fritz Stern Chair on Germany and Trans-Atlantic Relations @ConStelz\n\nDavid J.

Her focus is reporting breaking wire stories across international politics and social issues. She has covered culture, politics and the environment extensively for a number of digital publications. Shannon joined Newsweek in 2024 following roles at Euronews and The Independent's Indy100. She trained as a reporter with the Press Association and won a BBC award for her time as an editor and reporter at the University of East Anglia's student newspaper, Concrete.\u00a0You can get in touch with Shannon by emailing s.mcdonagh@newsweek.com. Languages: English.\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has declared that Moscow is prepared to employ \"all means\" to defend its interests, including advanced hypersonic weaponry, and said any war with the U.S. \"will take nuclear character.\"\n\nIn an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, released Friday, Lavrov emphasized Russia's readiness to escalate if necessary.\n\nThe 80-minute segment covered topics including Russia's relationship with the U.S., foreign policy decisions, and the implications of President-elect Donald Trump's second term on the war in Ukraine.\n\nLavrov, who\u2014with over 20 years on the job\u2014is the world's longest-serving foreign minister, criticized Washington for permitting Ukraine to utilize American-supplied long-range missiles in attacks on Russian territory, describing this as a perilous escalation.\n\nHe said the Western belief that Russia's red lines could be \"moved again and again\" is \"a very serious mistake.\"\n\nRegarding peace negotiations, Lavrov reaffirmed Russia's conditions, including Ukraine's withdrawal from four regions annexed by Russia in September 2022 and the abandonment of its NATO membership aspirations.\n\nHe also called for the protection of Russian speakers' rights in Ukraine.\n\nLavrov Links Biden's Actions to War Escalation\n\nPresident Joe Biden's approval for Ukraine to employ Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which have a range of up to 186 miles, enables deeper penetration into Russian-held areas.\n\nUkrainian officials view the authorization as a pivotal development that could alter the war's trajectory. Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga described it as a \"game changer,\" emphasizing its potential to significantly affect Ukraine's military operations.\n\n\"It is obvious that the Ukrainians would not be able to do what they're doing with long-range modern weapons without direct participation of the American servicemen,\" Lavrov said. \"And this is dangerous, no doubt about this.\"\n\nRussia's hypersonic weaponry can travel at five times the speed of sound\u2014approximately 3,836 miles per hour.\n\nLavrov spoke more positively when Carlson asked about Trump.\n\nHe said he is \"a very strong person, a person who wants results, who doesn't like procrastination on anything.\"\n\nWar With US Will Take on a 'Nuclear Character'\n\nThe recent deployment of Russia's new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile, Oreshnik, was highlighted by Lavrov as a message to the West regarding Moscow's determination.\n\n\"The message which we wanted to send by testing in real action this hypersonic system is that we will be ready to do anything to defend our legitimate interests,\" he said.\n\nLavrov added that any efforts by the U.S. and its allies to deliver long-range weapons to Kyiv would not go unanswered.\n\n\"We hate even to think about war with the United States, which will take nuclear character,\" he said, adding that exchange of nuclear strikes between Russia and NATO allies in Europe would unavoidably escalate into a broader conflict involving all parties.\n\nRussia has the world's largest stockpile of nuclear warheads, with an estimated 5,889 warheads as of 2024, according to the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nOver 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons are made up of Russian and U.S. stockpiles.\n\nCalls to End Western Aid to Kyiv\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin characterized the Nov. 21 Oreshnik strike as retaliation for Ukrainian attacks on Russian military facilities in the Bryansk and Kursk regions, conducted with Western-supplied weaponry.\n\nPutin warned that further assaults on Russian territory could lead to strikes on Kyiv's government district or military facilities of Western nations aiding Ukraine.\n\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press\n\nfairness meter\n\nfairness meter\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nTop stories\n\n'Trump Before Trump': How Hungary Foreshadows America's Right-Wing Embrace\n\nTrump Admin Deported Fewer People Than It Fired in First Month\u2014Report\n\nWho Is Dan Caine? 3-Star Gen.

Kirill Dmitriev, the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), also took part in the negotiation process. The American side was represented by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Steve Witkoff, Washington\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor the EU participated in the meeting, with Kiev stating it would not recognize the outcome of the talks unless it was involved.\n\nSpeaking to reporters shortly after the meeting in Riyadh, Lavrov stated that as part of the agreement to initiate the Ukraine conflict settlement process, Russia will appoint its representative once it receives confirmation of Washington\u2019s designated negotiator.\n\n\u201cI believe the discussions were highly productive,\u201d Lavrov said, adding, \u201cNot only did we listen, but we genuinely heard each other.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that he had reason to believe the American side \u201cnow has a clearer understanding of Russia\u2019s position,\u201d as it had been \u201cthoroughly detailed\u201d using specific examples drawn from President Putin\u2019s numerous statements.\n\nLavrov pointed out that the meeting in Riyadh was initiated by the Russian and US presidents, who had agreed that preparations for the next summit should be started. To achieve this, foreign ministers and national security advisers were tasked with meeting and determining what needed to be worked out before the two presidents \u201ccan negotiate specific dates and timelines for the summit.\u201d\n\nMoscow and Washington have agreed that \u201cwhen national interests coincide, efforts must be united and implemented\u201d in relevant areas through \u201cmutually beneficial projects\u201d in both geopolitical and economic spheres, according to Lavrov. However, when interests do not align, the sides should not provoke a conflict but rather work to resolve issues, he added.\n\nLavrov also touched on the issue of the US engagement with the EU concerning security guarantees and the potential deployment of a contingent force in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe explained to our counterparts that President Putin has repeatedly emphasized that NATO expansion and the absorption of Ukraine into the military bloc pose a direct threat to Russia\u2019s interests and sovereignty,\u201d he stressed.\n\nMoscow made it clear that it considers any NATO-linked military presence \u2013 whether under the EU flag or as part of national contingents \u2013 completely unacceptable, according to Lavrov.\n\nThe Russian foreign minister added that the sides \u201cpractically agreed that the issue of diplomatic missions must be resolved once and for all.\u201d\u00a0He noted that this includes addressing the sanctions imposed in recent years, the expulsion of diplomats, the seizure of diplomatic properties, and other obstacles that have complicated work.\n\n\u201cOur deputies will soon meet to discuss the removal of these artificial barriers and ensure the smooth functioning of embassies and consulates in both countries,\u201d Lavrov stated.\n\nTop stories\n\nRT Features\n\nTop stories\n\nRT Features\n\nRT News App\n\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132025.

The discussions, including key figures like Kirill Dmitriev and Sergei Lavrov, aim to restore U.S.-Russia relations and explore economic impacts, with Europe deliberating its security role.\n\nIn a move that underscores shifting diplomatic dynamics, U.S. President Donald Trump is being hailed as a potential problem solver ahead of significant U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia. These discussions are anticipated to address Moscow's ongoing conflict in Ukraine and could set the stage for a future summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nKirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, expressed optimism over Trump's capability in swiftly tackling major challenges. Meanwhile, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is prepared to meet U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to discuss resolving the Ukraine war and revitalizing Russia-U.S. relations.\n\nAmid these developments, European leaders have responded with urgency, emphasizing the need for defense investments and security guarantees for Ukraine. The meeting marks a departure from former President Biden's stance and signals a recalibration of Washington's diplomatic strategy concerning Moscow.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)\n\nALSO READ\n\nTug of War: Trump, Putin, and the Future of Ukraine\n\nAkums Drugs Boosts EBITDA Amidst Strategic European Expansion\n\nAkums' Strategic Expansion: 12% EBITDA Boost and New European Contract\n\nEthiopia Nears Resolution in Major Debt Restructuring Talks\n\nElon Musk Declares No Interest in TikTok Acquisition Amid U.S. Ban Talks\n\nTRENDING\n\nJudge Extends Block on Musk's Cost-Cutting Team DOGE on Treasury Access\n\nTrump Tightens Reins on China Deals Amid Strategic Concerns\n\nIsrael and Hamas: Hostage Exchange Amid Fragile Ceasefire\n\nJudge Halts Trump's DEI Program Ban\n\nOPINION / BLOG / INTERVIEW\n\nStrengthening AMR Control: Japan\u2019s Shift to a Targeted One Health Approach\n\nCombatting Healthcare Fraud: The Role of Digital Technology and Analytics\n\nSaline Agriculture Solutions: Securing Viet Nam\u2019s Mekong Delta Farms\n\nAutomation in South Korea: How AI and Robotics Are Reshaping Work and Wages\n\nDevShots\n\nLatest News\n\nIsrael Delays Palestinian Prisoner Release Amid Hostage Swap Controversy\n\nLatin America Unites in Prayer for Pope Francis\n\nEuropean Leaders Rally to Secure U.S. Support Amid Ukraine Crisis\n\nDmitry Bivol Triumphs in Light-Heavyweight Showdown\n\nConnect us on\n\nSECTORS\n\nEDITIONS\n\nOTHER LINKS\n\nOTHER PRODUCTS\n\nCONNECT\n\nEmail: info@devdiscourse.com Phone: +91-720-6444012, +91-7027739813, 14, 15\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2025\n\n\n",

    "content": "The recent interactions between the United States and Russia indicate a significant shift in their diplomatic relations, particularly in the context of the ongoing Ukraine conflict. As of February 2025, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, engaged in talks with Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia, aiming to \"normailse\" ties and open discussions regarding the end of hostilities in Ukraine. This meeting was described as positive, marking what is considered a critical first step despite the absence of Ukrainian representation, which has raised concerns among European allies regarding the future of peace negotiations. The U.S. has stated its commitment to involve European nations in any subsequent discussions, emphasizing the necessity of including them due to their imposition of sanctions against Russia <cite>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-russia-talks-ukraine-war_n_67b45839e4b0765f4479761c</cite>.\n\nIn light of these developments, it is essential for the U.S. to establish clear recommendations for its policy towards Russia. First, a dual approach of deterrence coupled with engagement should be prioritized. While military support for Ukraine remains critical, expressions of a willingness to negotiate with Russia could create openings for diplomatic dialogue that may facilitate a sustainable resolution to the conflict <cite>https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-russia-relations-crossroads</cite>. Secondly, the U.S. should ensure that any agreements reached do not sideline Ukraine, emphasizing that Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity must be central to all discussions moving forward <cite>https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/18/us-and-russian-officials-meet-for-high-stakes-peace-talks-without-ukraine</cite>.\n\nFurther, expanding engagement in arms control discussions can play a vital role. Revitalizing treaties that have been in jeopardy due to deteriorating U.S.-Russia relations can help establish trust and create frameworks for ongoing cooperation in nuclear non-proliferation <cite>https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-russia-relations-crossroads</cite>. Moreover, collaboration with allies to present a unified front against Russian aggression while simultaneously opening channels for negotiation could help mitigate risks posed by further escalation in Eastern Europe <cite>https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA2510-1.html</cite>.\n\nThe recent shift in U.S. policy and talks with Russia underscore a complex interplay of military, economic, and diplomatic considerations essential for fostering a stable international environment. As negotiations progress, the U.S. must balance its approach to address its national security interests while engaging with Russia in a manner that encourages de-escalation and constructive cooperation <cite>https://www.foreign.senate.gov/hearings/what-comes-next-for-us-policy-towards-russia</cite>."

    "content": "In recent years, the relationship between the United States and Russia has been characterized by heightened tensions and mutual distrust, evolving politically and militarily. One of the pivotal areas of focus has been the United States' insistence on maintaining pressure on Russia to ensure compliance with international norms and agreements. This pressure has manifested itself through a series of sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and strategic military maneuvers. The rationale behind these actions is often linked to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its role in destabilizing Ukraine, which have both been met with widespread condemnation from the international community <cite>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27402404<cite>.\n\nMoreover, the United States has facilitated a framework for strengthening NATO's eastern flank as a direct counter to perceived Russian aggression. Increased troop deployments and military exercises in Eastern Europe are part of a broader strategy to deter potential Russian expansionism and demonstrate commitment to the defense of NATO allies. The U.S. has emphasized the importance of collective defense, reiterating that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all, thus maintaining a robust military presence in the region to send a clear message to Moscow <cite>https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_82788.htm<cite>.\n\nThe diplomatic landscape has also shifted, with the U.S. calling for increased international cooperation to hold Russia accountable for its actions, particularly regarding its interference in foreign elections and state-sponsored cyber activities. Congressional initiatives have pushed for tighter regulations and sanctions targeting Russian oligarchs and enterprises linked to the Kremlin. This is further highlighted by numerous legislative actions that have aimed to limit Russia's economic capabilities and restrict access to financial markets <cite>https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7372/text<cite>.\n\nIn addition, the Biden administration has sought to balance pressure with diplomacy, engaging with Russia on various fronts while remaining firm on core issues such as human rights violations and military aggression. The strategic dialogue initiated with the aim of arms control and cybersecurity demonstrates a complex approach where the U.S. aims to manage a competitive relationship while addressing areas of mutual concern <cite>https://www.state.gov/us-russia-strategic-stability-dialogue-2/cite>.\n\nMoreover, civil society efforts within Russia, alongside international human rights organizations, have been crucial in upholding pressure on the Kremlin for compliance with international standards. The Russian government's heavy-handed response to dissent, including the treatment of political prisoners and the crackdown on protests, has drawn further condemnation from the U.S. and its allies, fueling calls for sanctions as a means of holding Russia accountable for its actions <cite>https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/russia<cite>. The intertwined nature of military, economic, and diplomatic efforts reflects a multifaceted approach by the U.S. to address the complexities of its relationship with Russia while striving to uphold international norms in the face of aggressive state behavior."

Security & Defense Ukraine\nNew Atlanticist\nDecember 4, 2024\nA winning strategy to end Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine\n\nThese policy recommendations for the incoming US administration reflect discussion among experts from the United States, the United Kingdom, European Union member states, Ukraine, and Russia convened at the University of Michigan on December 2-3 and hosted by the Weiser Center for Europe and Eurasia and the Atlantic Council.\nRussia\u2014supported by China, Iran, and North Korea\u2014remains a threat the United States and Europe must tackle through strength and resolve. If unchecked, Russia\u2019s malign actions, including its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, will damage US political, military, and economic interests in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. President Donald Trump has an opportunity to conduct a more effective pressure campaign against Russia and seek an end to the war. Doing so will thwart Russia and its allies and reduce the chances of World War III.\nA winning strategy requires security and eventual membership in NATO and the European Union for Ukraine. Ukraine has made clear its willingness to join negotiations to end the war, while senior officials in the Russian government have dismissed offers for negotiations of a peaceful settlement. US interests will advance if Ukraine remains free and sovereign, and Russia fails in its aggressive war and is deterred in the future. Recommendations for the next US administration include:\n\n\nAn early ceasefire along the existing lines can suspend the high-intensity war but must be linked with provisions for Ukraine\u2019s security. A ceasefire must be enforced by troops on the ground. NATO\u2019s European\u00a0members should lead this effort,\u00a0with US backup support.\n\n\nDefense\u00a0guarantees will be a prerequisite to a durable end to the war. Eventual NATO membership is the optimal way to ensure Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and security. Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO is not to be negotiated with Russia but should be settled between the United States, its NATO allies, and Ukraine.\u00a0\n\n\nA NATO defense of Ukraine can be built on the foundation of its\u00a0resources, fighting spirit, cutting-edge military technology,\u00a0and battle-hardened army. This army, though the most powerful in Europe outside of Russia, will still need to be reinforced with outside support. The increasing capabilities of European militaries can provide additional backing that the Ukrainians need to deter a future war. US arms will be essential to this.\u00a0\n\n\nAs with West Germany, which joined NATO in 1955, NATO\u2019s defense guarantee would apply only to that part of Ukrainian territory under control of the Ukrainian government. The United States should reject Russia\u2019s demand for forced neutrality and de facto disarmament for Ukraine.\n\n\nThe United States and Europe should not recognize Russia\u2019s claims to Ukrainian territory and reject any change to borders by force\u2014as done in the Stimson Doctrine of 1932 (Manchuria), the Welles Declaration of 1940 (Baltic states), and the Pompeo Declaration of 2018 (Crimea).\u00a0\n\n\nAs a NATO member, Ukraine would commit to restore its territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders through peaceful and diplomatic means. Before its accession, allies would take additional steps to integrate Ukraine into the Alliance, in particular by offering Ukraine a permanent seat at the North Atlantic Council and a Ukrainian general a seat at the Military Committee.\n\n\nEurope must do more for Ukraine\u2019s security and its own. The United States and Europe should bolster joint activities and investments in their defense industries.\n\n\nThe United States and its allies need a new policy of containment of Russia. This also includes maintaining hold on the immobilized Russian sovereign assets and restrictions on technology, and caution in lifting sanctions. There should be no return to reliance on Russian energy or other resources. Allies should be prepared to intensify economic pressure and make Russia pay the price should it violate ceasefire terms.\u00a0\n\n\nThe actions outlined here, which can earn the necessary Ukrainian public support, will bring peace to Europe, advance the security and prosperity of the United States and its allies, provide a check to would-be aggressors, and restore American global leadership: a clear winning strategy.\n\n\nThe following experts participated in the discussions at the Unive[TOO LONG, END]\n\n---\nURL: https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/08/ukraine-advancing-its-peace-plan-us-can-help\nTitle: None\nContent:\nUkraine is advancing its peace plan.

The U.S. can help.\nKyiv seeks a \u2018peace summit\u2019 amid U.N. meetings next month. Preparatory talks are underway.\nThursday, August 3, 2023 /\nBy: Sasha Pippenger\nPublication Type: Analysis\nShare This\nPrint the Page\nWhile Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive against Russia\u2019s invasion has global attention on the battlefield, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government is also busy advancing a diplomatic initiative: a peace summit to build momentum and cohesion among international partners on its 10-point peace plan. The United States should be a leader in backing this diplomatic effort \u2014 which is on the agenda this weekend in multilateral talks in Saudi Arabia. Broadening international buy-in for Ukraine\u2019s peace plan serves U.S. interests. It can short-circuit less constructive peace initiatives and reinforce a cardinal international norm: An aggressor that launches an unprovoked war can't expect to set the terms for peace afterward.\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks alongside the leaders of France, Japan and the United States in July as their nations and others restated support for Ukraine and its diplomatic efforts on a peace plan. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)\nUkraine: Building a Peace Plan\nZelenskyy presented Ukraine\u2019s 10 principles for peace last November at a conference of the Group of 20 nations, and his government has been building international support for them over months. A peace plan, once finalized with broad international support, could serve as a shared platform for eventual multilateral negotiations to help end the war. Although Ukrainian leaders are in no rush to sit back down at the table with the Russians, they recognize that some form of negotiations will eventually be needed \u2014 whether to reach a comprehensive political settlement or just to hash out technicalities after a military victory. The United States should follow this cue and begin thinking through how to best support Ukraine diplomatically when it reaches this juncture.\nAll signals from officials in Kyiv indicate that Ukraine foresees eventual negotiations as a strictly multilateral affair. Having endured tense bilateral negotiations with Russians through the early stages of the war in March and April of 2022, Ukrainian leaders are adamantly unwilling to entertain resuming that format. The only negotiating table they wish to sit at now is one at which the United States and other partners are seated shoulder-to-shoulder alongside them.\nOne reason for the Ukrainians\u2019 firmness on this is the agonizing failure of the eight-year peace effort through the \u201cNormandy Format\u201d peace talks. Ukraine accepted France and Germany as mediators in those talks soon after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, seizing Crimea and part of southeastern Ukraine, in the Donbas. Those talks led to two agreements signed in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, in 2014 and 2015 that failed to obtain Russia\u2019s withdrawal or an end to violence. Given that history, Ukrainians are understandably wary of multilateral talks that would not include the United States. They consider U.S. participation a condition for re-engaging in talks with Putin\u2019s regime.\nTo build the widest possible support for Ukraine\u2019s plan, Zelenskyy\u2019s team has been undertaking steady diplomatic legwork. In June \u2014 on the weekend that Yevgeny Prighozhin, the leader of Russia\u2019s Wagner Group, seized global attention with the drama of his brief mutiny against Putin \u2014 the head of President Zelenskyy\u2019s office, Andriy Yermak, was preoccupied with other priorities. He was in Copenhagen to discuss Ukraine\u2019s approach with counterparts from the Group of Seven countries, as well as from Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Brazil, India and South Africa.\nThis weekend, Ukraine will seek to further these efforts at talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia \u2014 a session that, critically, is expected to include a senior Chinese official, according to news reports. Arriving at a common roadmap for peace with China, which has floated its own peace plan, would add substantial momentum to Ukraine\u2019s approach on peace talks. Ukraine has made clear that, while it will seek to accommodate the views of its partners as it refines the provisions, it will insist that Ukraine\u2019s formula remain the basis for any multilateral peace plan.\nA Next Goal: A \u2018Peace Summit\u2019\nThese consultations are laying the groundwork for an eventual peace summit among heads of state that Ukraine now aims to hold in the margins of next month\u2019s U.N. General Assembly meetings. To achieve that, Ukraine will need in its working-level consultations to build unity around a common platform. This will mean ensuring that key governments intrigued by other plans, such as those circulated by China or by a group of seven African states, are persuaded to support Ukraine\u2019s text. Second, convening a Ukraine-led peace summit alongside the U.N. meetings will likely require support from some or all of its usual partner countries in the U.N. Security Council \u2014 Britain, France and the United States \u2014 to persuade U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres to allow the summit at that time. The difficulty for Guterres is that such a summit would pointedly exclude Russia and thereby inevitably exacerbate tensions in the already deeply dysfunctional atmosphere within the Security Council.\nIt's not easy work, but Ukraine is clearly ready to apply the elbow grease to get it done. A peace summit could help complete and ratify a realistic approach to achieving peace in Ukraine. The United States can help advance this effort \u2014 not only with its participation in the upcoming diplomatic meetings, but also by reaching out to other actors that Ukraine wishes to bring into the effort \u2014 particularly countries from the Global South.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSasha Pippenger\nActing Director, Inclusive Peace Processes and Reconciliation\nThe Current Situation in Ukraine\nUSIP expert analysis on Russia's war in Ukraine\nLearn more\nIssue Areas\n Global Policy Peace Processes\nCountries\nRussiaUkraine\nStay Informed\nUSIP has a variety of newsletters and announcements with the latest analysis, publications and events.\nSign up!\nRelated Publications\n\nRussia\u2019s Nuclear Doctrine Amendments: Scare Tactics or Real Shift?\nWednesday, January 29, 2025\nBy: Katarzyna Zysk, Ph.D.\nSince the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Moscow has relied on nuclear coercion and compellence to shape Western decision-making. On November 19, 2024, President Vladimir Putin approved amendments to Russia's nuclear doctrine, signaling a lowered threshold for nuclear first use.

India\u2019s balancing act was on display earlier this year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Russia in July and made a historic trip to Ukraine the following month. Modi has portrayed a neutral stance on the Ukraine war and positioned India as a key player in any potential peace process.\nType: Question and Answer\nGlobal Policy;\u00a0 Peace Processes\n\nDonald Jensen on the War in Ukraine\u2019s Trajectory\nFriday, January 3, 2025\nBy: Donald N.

This relationship, while rooted in history, represents a significant departure from previous patterns of cooperation. China-Russia ties have evolved from a transactional relationship of convenience to a more durable strategic alignment, while continuing to fall short of a full-blown military alliance. This development challenges traditional Western assumptions about the limits of authoritarian cooperation and may signal the emergence of a new model of international partnership.\nType: Analysis\nGlobal Policy\nView All Publications\nLatest News\nAssessing the Crackdown on Thai-Myanmar Border Scam Centers - The Irrawaddy\nThursday, February 20, 2025\nRewind and Reconnoiter: India Still Holds Opportunity for Washington - War on the Rocks\nWednesday, February 19, 2025\nTrump, Modi aim to cut U.S. trade gap with India amid global tariff concerns - The Washington Post\nThursday, February 13, 2025\nHow Trump\u2019s air force picks signal blast-off in the US-China military space race - South China Morning Post\nWednesday, February 12, 2025\nView All News[TOO LONG, END]\n\n---\nURL: https://www.fpri.org/article/2023/02/the-confrontation-with-russia-and-us-grand-strategy/\nTitle: None\nContent:\nThe Confrontation with Russia and US Grand Strategy - Foreign Policy Research Institute\n A Nation Must Think Before it Acts The Confrontation with Russia and US Grand Strategy\nShare:\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nMail\n\n\nA nation must think before it acts.\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nBluesky\nLinkedin\nYoutube\n\n \n\n\nSearch\n\n\nResearch\n\nResearch Programs\nAfrica\nAsia\nEurasia\nNational Security\n\n\nRegions & Topics\nBaltic Sea\nBlack Sea\nCentral Asia\nChina & Taiwan\nNATO\nRussia\nUkraine\n\n\n\n\nPublications\nAnalysis\nReports\nExpert Commentary\nPodcasts\nTies That Bind: NATO at 75 and Beyond\nChain Reaction\nBear Market Brief\nBaltic Ways\nReport in Short\nOverheard\n\n\nOrbis\nConversations\nIntern Corner\nNewsletters\n\n\nExperts\nDirectory\nPress Contact\n\n\nEvents\nUpcoming Events\nCalendar\nPeople, Politics, and Prose\nBriefings, Booktalks, and Conversations\nThe Benjamin Franklin Award\nEvent and Lecture Archive\n\n\nAbout\nOur Mission\nAnnual Report\nOur Team\nBoard\nBoard of Trustees\nBoard of Advisors\n\n\nResearch Programs\nNews\nInternships\nCareers\nFinancials\nAudited Financials\nForm 990\nPA Certificate of Charitable Registration\n\n\n\n\nSupport\nDonate\nMembership\nPartnership\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe Confrontation with Russia and US Grand Strategy\n\nNikolas K. Gvosdev\nFebruary 16, 2023\nNational Security Program\n\nHome / Articles / The Confrontation with Russia and US Grand Strategy\nBottom Line\n\nThe United States no longer views cooperation with Russia as a possibility and is now focused on knocking Russia out of the ranks of the great powers.\nReducing Russian capabilities is more important than forestalling further cooperation between Russia and China.\nUkraine is now a central priority for American strategy and is no longer ancillary to the larger US-Russia relationship.\n\nOver the past year, two understated but dramatic shifts in US strategy have taken place: the United States no longer seeks to prioritize cooperation with Russia and no longer expects to forestall greater Russia-China cooperation. Support for Ukraine becomes critical as part of an overall strategy designed to degrade Russian capabilities. These developments will, in turn, shape and constrain the options available to the United States over the next decade.\nFor the past thirty years, US policy towards Russia has toggled back and forth between the hope that a post-Soviet Russia could become a near-peer partner to the United States, and concerns about Russia\u2019s ability to raise costs for and frustrate US preferences for Europe and the Middle East. The effort to \u201creset\u201d US-Russia relations during the first term of the Obama administration took place against the backdrop of Ukrainian elections that brought Viktor Yanukovych to power in Kyiv, and his efforts to balance between Ukraine\u2019s desire for greater economic integration with Europe and reassuring Russia on its security agenda.\nWhen the 2014 Maidan Revolution provided a popular rejection of Yanukovych\u2019s regime, the Obama effort to reset relations became unsustainable. In response to a renewed push for Western integration on the part of the post-Yanukovych Ukrainian governments, Vladimir Putin resorted to outright force to seize control of Crimea and foment uprisings in southeastern Ukraine designed to destabilize the country and force its federalization. From this point onward, the US-Russia partnership became politically untenable.\nYet, during the last years of the Obama administration, the Trump administration, and into the first year of the Biden administration, Russia policy was stuck between those advocating a more robust pushback against a \u201crevisionist\u201d Kremlin\u2014with Russia now identified as a \u201cgreat power\u201d competitor of the United States\u2014and those seeking to find ways to manage competition and limit confrontation, on the grounds that Washington needed to be able to focus more of its attention on Iran and China. As the United States intensified sanctions pressure on Tehran, for instance, it quietly accepted that Russian energy would fill the gaps, even if it meant strengthening the resources at Moscow\u2019s disposal. And Russia was still seen as a necessary partner in any long-term coalition meant to balance the rise of China.\nRussia\u2019s open invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, however, has brought the debate to an end. Even with no formal statement of policy, the policy signals are quite clear: the United States no longer believes it is possible to either move forward on any agenda of partnership with Russia, at least under Putin, and that a Russia that continues to wield a mix of hard, soft and sharp power capabilities creates obstacles for the United States. Thus, the United States, via sanctions, trade policy, financial instruments, and outright military support for Ukraine, is seeking to degrade Russian tools of statecraft. If Russia cannot be, from Washington\u2019s perspective, a near-peer partner, then it must be reduced to the status of a non-peer competitor.\nReducing Russia\u2019s great-power capabilities also takes priority over preventing or disincentivizing a closer entente between Moscow and Beijing. In essence, the United States is prepared to accept that China may gain a temporary boost from having additional, low-cost access to Russian natural resources (and that Beijing can offer a partial lifeline to maintain Moscow\u2019s position). The gamble is that the long-term degradation of Russian capabilities will reduce the level of support Beijing might be able to expect from its partnership with Moscow.\nIn addition to trying to reduce Russia\u2019s overall levels of national power, the United States also appears to be committing to the long-term renovation of the Ukrainian state. The level of military, economic, and financial support to Kyiv moves beyond a more limited mission set of weakening Russian capabilities in favor of constructing Ukraine as a 21st\u2013century front-line state against a Russia now deemed to be implacably hostile\u2014and for this renovated Ukraine to acquire a set of capabilities akin to those possessed by South Korea, Taiwan, or Israel. In other words, a Ukraine that can sustain an impressive degree of military and technological capability and have the economic base to support its position. While the Biden administration may not openly be endorsing former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s \u201cThree Lighthouses\u201d approach, the idea is that Ukraine\u2019s importance to the United States will increase as it is expected to serve as the anchor of the Euro-Atlantic world\u2019s eastern bulwark (as Israel does for the Middle East and Taiwan for East Asia). With the recent release of Japan\u2019s new national security strategy, and the related defense white paper envisioning a web of partnerships to connect the Indo-Pacific basin with the Euro-Atlantic region, and identifying the defense of Ukraine as central to this effort, Ukraine is moving to assume a more central role in geopolitics and as part of US and allied efforts to contain the China challenge independent of how this might impact US relations with Moscow.\nFrom George H.W. Bush to the first year of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, US policy tried to balance Ukraine\u2019s desire for closer relations with the Euro-Atlantic world with preserving a cooperative relationship with Moscow. In his meetings with both Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin in summer 2021, Biden attempted to manage this balancing act. Putin\u2019s decision to launch the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in February 2022 has brought this effort to a close. American support for Ukraine and the concurrent effort to weaken Russian capabilities outweigh any possible benefits the United States might receive from a cooperative relationship with Moscow, and the risks of a closer Russia-China entente are less pressing than containing Russia\u2019s efforts to forcibly modify the post-Cold War order. The United States is now gambling that knitting together a coalition of its European and Asian partners to thwart Russian ambitions in Ukraine will translate into an enduring coalition that can contain and limit China\u2019s revisionism down the line.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and do not necessarily reflect the position of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a non-partisan organization that seeks to publish well-argued, policy-oriented articles on American foreign policy and national security priorities.\n\nNikolas K.

    "content": "In February 2025, a pivotal meeting took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where senior officials from the United States and Russia engaged in discussions aimed at ending the ongoing war in Ukraine and improving bilateral relations. This marked a substantial shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump, diverging from the previous administration's strategy, which had focused on isolating Russia through sanctions and military support to Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov articulated a consensus on three main objectives during their talks: restoring diplomatic missions in both capitals, forming a high-level task force dedicated to Ukraine peace negotiations, and exploring economic cooperation opportunities between the two nations <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/<cite>.\n\nThis meeting came at a time when relations between the U.S. and Russia had deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began in 2022. The U.S. and its European allies imposed sweeping sanctions aimed at crippling the Russian economy, leading to a dramatic decline in diplomatic relations, which were marked by the expulsion of diplomats and closure of consulates. The developments leading to the 2025 talks reflect a series of geopolitical calculations made by both sides, particularly regarding their respective positions in global diplomacy and military engagement. European allies, such as Ukraine, expressed concern over the potential exclusion from significant negotiations affecting their sovereignty, highlighting a shift away from inclusivity in diplomatic talks that characterized previous U.S. policy under President Joe Biden <cite>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-russia-meeting-improving-relations-ukraine-war/<cite>.\n\nThe backdrop of these discussions includes ongoing military actions in Ukraine, with Russia reportedly launching significant drone attacks during the same period, causing casualties and destruction <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/<cite>. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed firm opposition to any negotiations from which Ukraine was absent, reaffirming Ukraine's stance on requiring involvement in discussions about its future. Furthermore, as noted by French President Emmanuel Macron, a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine hinges on the cessation of Russian aggression and credible security guarantees for Ukraine, indicating the multi-layered and complex nature of any potential agreements <cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html<cite>. \n\nThese developments illustrate a dramatic pivot in U.S. foreign policy towards Russia, driven by a combination of strategic military considerations, economic motivations, and internal political dynamics within both nations. The implications of this shift hold the potential for altering the geopolitical landscape in Europe and beyond, fundamentally altering alliances and partnerships in facing mutual challenges <cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html<cite>."

The meeting between senior officials from both countries was a striking display of bonhomie after three years of American efforts to isolate Moscow for its 2022 invasion.\nAfter more than four hours of talks, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both sides had agreed to work on a peace settlement for Ukraine as well as to explore \u201cthe incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians,\u201d both geopolitically and economically.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t just listening to each other, but we heard each other,\u201d Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, said. \u201cI have reason to believe that the American side started to better understand our positions.\u201d\nThe meeting, the most extensive negotiations in more than three years between the two global powers, was the latest swerve by the Trump administration in abandoning Western efforts to punish Russia for starting Europe\u2019s most destructive war in generations. It signaled Mr. Trump\u2019s intention to roll back the Biden administration\u2019s approach toward Moscow, which focused on sanctions, isolation and sending weapons to Ukraine that helped kill tens of thousands of Russian soldiers.\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, American officials did not dwell on Russia\u2019s violation of international law in attacking Ukraine, its alleged war crimes or the three years of devastation that Russian shelling and bombardment had wrought in parts of Ukraine. Instead, they repeatedly lauded Mr. Trump for trying to stop the fighting by talking to Russia in a way that his predecessor did not.\n\u201cFor three years,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, \u201cno one else has been able to bring something together like what we saw today, because Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that can.\u201d\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The Biden administration has driven them into a deadlock.\u201d\nRyabkov warned that the U.S. and its allies must carefully assess the risks stemming from supplying increasingly powerful Western weapons to Ukraine.\n\u201cThe Americans need to thoroughly and deeply weigh the risks linked to their unabashedly cavalier course,\u201d he said.\nRyabkov noted that Moscow doesn\u2019t trust Western statements about self-imposed restrictions on a range of weapons supplied to Ukraine in order to avoid escalation, adding that such assurances in the past have served as cover for a steady expansion of the assortment of arms deliveries.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any sign of reason in any of the NATO and EU members\u2019 capitals,\u201d Ryabkov said. \u201cWhat they are doing isn\u2019t going to strengthen their security.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Zelenskyy urges EU to grant Ukraine membership\nHe rejected the U.S. argument that Russia\u2019s refusal to allow the resumption of inspections of its nuclear facilities represents a breach of the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control pact between the two countries.\nThe New START treaty, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.\nJust days before the treaty was due to expire in February 2021, Russia and the United States agreed to extend it for another five years.\nRussia and the U.S. have suspended mutual inspections under New START since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Moscow last fall refused to allow their resumption, raising uncertainty about the pact\u2019s future. Russia also indefinitely postponed a planned round of consultations under the treaty.\nThe U.S. State Department last week said that Russia\u2019s refusal to allow the inspections \u201cprevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control.\u201d It noted that nothing prevents Russian inspectors from conducting inspections of the U.S. facilities.\nRyabkov on Thursday insisted that Russia has continued to comply with the treaty and exchange information in accordance with it. \u201cWe adhere to the treaty and observe its provisions,\u201d he said.\nAt the same time, he reaffirmed Moscow\u2019s view that resuming inspections wasn\u2019t possible in the current environment.\nRyabkov\u2019s comments followed a Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s statement declaring that it was impossible to maintain \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with Washington at a time when \u201cthe U.S. has effectively unleashed a total hybrid war against Russia, which is fraught with a real danger of a direct military confrontation between the two nuclear powers.\u201d\nIt charged that Washington\u2019s demand for resuming inspections of Russian nuclear facilities sounds \u201ccynical\u201d after a recent series of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian air bases housing nuclear-capable strategic bombers that the ministry said relied on U.S. intelligence assistance.\nRyabkov, who met recently with the new U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Lynne Tracy, also said that the Russian Foreign Ministry has lodged a formal complaint to the U.S. Embassy, charging that its use of social networks represented interference in Russia\u2019s domestic affairs.\nLeft: FILE PHOTO: Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov speaks during a news conference in Moscow, Russia February 7, 2019.

    "content": "The recent diplomatic engagement between the United States and Russia marks a significant pivot in their longstanding adversarial relationship, particularly in the context of economic cooperation. During a high-profile meeting held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov articulated plans to normalize bilateral relations, focusing on peace negotiations around the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, while also exploring economic partnerships. This meeting was described as the most extensive contact between the two nations since the onset of Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022, highlighting a potential shift from isolationist policies that characterized the Biden administration towards a more engagement-focused approach under the Trump administration <cite>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-and-u-s-officials-meet-in-saudi-arabia-without-ukraine-to-discuss-improving-ties-and-ending-war<cite>.\n\nThe discussions encompassed not only diplomatic staffing and the establishment of a high-level team to facilitate peace talks, but also emphasized joint economic opportunities that could arise if the conflict were resolved. Rubio suggested that ending the war in Ukraine could \"unlock the door\" for substantial geopolitical cooperation, which would also align economic interests between the two nations <cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html<cite>. These sentiments were echoed by Lavrov, who claimed that the talks were productive and noted a significant understanding of each side\u2019s positions <cite>https://apnews.com/article/us-russia-rubio-lavrov-ukraine-saudi-arabia-94bc4de5ecc86922d6ea4376e38f1cfd<cite>.\n\nHistorically, U.S.-Russia economic relations faced considerable challenges, particularly following the sanctions imposed in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and subsequent actions in Ukraine. The economic engagement between the two countries has been severely limited due to political tensions; however, with the potential easing of hostilities, there emerges a prospect for reevaluation of trade policies. Economic analysts have indicated that for both countries, reopening channels of trade and investment could serve as a means of stabilizing their relationships, fostering a mutually beneficial environment amid broader geopolitical complexities <cite>https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-russia-economic-relations<cite>.\n\nFurthermore, the discussions held in Riyadh reflect a strategic reorientation not only between the involved nations but also within the broader context of international diplomacy, as other allies, particularly Ukraine, express concern about being sidelined in potential agreements. Russian statesman Yuri Ushakov mentioned the possibility of organizing a summit between Presidents Trump and Putin, aiming to solidify these diplomatic strides <cite>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-and-u-s-officials-meet-in-saudi-arabia-without-ukraine-to-discuss-improving-ties-and-ending-war<cite>. As Washington explores this new path of engagement with Moscow, the international community remains cautious, assessing how these changes may affect not only U.S.-Russia relations but also the stability and security of Eastern Europe and beyond."

    "content": "The relationship between the United States and Russia, particularly in the context of the Cold War, has been defined by a series of confrontations and rivalries, but recent developments indicate a shift towards tentative engagement. Dating back to the Cold War, the dynamics were primarily characterized by the ideological battle between capitalism and communism, which manifested in direct military confrontations, arms races, and proxy wars globally. Significant events, such as the establishment of the USSR in 1922 and the subsequent recognition by the U.S. in 1933, laid the foundation for a complex relationship fraught with tension and mistrust, particularly during milestones like the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, where both superpowers stood on the brink of nuclear confrontation <cite>https://www.thoughtco.com/timeline-of-us-russian-relations-3310271</cite>.\n\nFast forward to the post-Cold War era, the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a dramatic turning point that temporarily eased tensions and fostered a collaborative spirit, with the U.S. supporting Russia's integration into global institutions and promoting constructive diplomatic relations <cite>https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-russia/</cite>. However, this thaw was short-lived, especially following significant geopolitical events, including Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which led to international sanctions and a significant deterioration in relations <cite>https://www.russiamatters.org/facts/timeline-us-russia-relations-1983-2023</cite>.\n\nRecently, however, under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, signs of a potential warming trend have emerged, paralleling the adversarial rhetoric that characterized the initial years of the Biden administration. High-stakes negotiations between U.S. and Russian officials occurred in February 2025, signaling an intention to \u201cnormalize\u201d relations and explore pathways to peace discussions regarding Ukraine <cite>https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/18/us-and-russian-officials-meet-high-stakes-peace-talks-without-ukraine</cite>. These talks, which facilitated a critical dialogue absent for nearly three years, highlighted a shift in the U.S. approach to Russia, suggesting a possible withdrawal from the hardline stance previously adopted in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Even as the ongoing conflict continues to create complexities, both nations appear to be considering the implications of diplomatic engagement and what that means for future cooperation\u2014or conflict\u2014in the international arena <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>. \n\nMoreover, this emerging dialogue is also intertwined with the broader strategy regarding NATO and security assurances, which have historically been contentious issues. Russia\u2019s longstanding demands for the withdrawal of NATO forces from Eastern Europe, first made in the lead-up to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, underscore the geopolitical chess game that both nations are engaged in\u2014a game that now seems to require both sides to contemplate concessions in the face of sustained international pressure and emerging economic ramifications <cite>https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-russian-officials-meet-2-weeks-discuss-ending/story?id=119074910</cite>. Thus, the trajectory of U.S.-Russia relations remains a critical area of observation as both nations navigate the tumultuous waters of diplomacy, military strategy, and international norms established during the Cold War and its aftermath."

As Ukraine\u2019s then-Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Valery Zaluzhny, declared: stalemate. Since November 2022, over a year ago, the front line has moved fewer than 20 miles. Meanwhile, both sides have experienced enormous losses, with hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and Russians estimated to have been injured or killed. Both Russia\u2019s 2022 winter offensive and Ukraine\u2019s 2023 summer counteroffensive failed to break the deadlock despite high costs in lives and equipment. After two years of calls to support Ukraine in taking back all its territory, Western analysts entered 2024 strategically adrift, as total Ukrainian victory appears increasingly unrealistic, and Russia hopes to hold a Trump card following the US elections in November.\nMajor battlefield swings appear unlikely. Territorial change effectively ceased since the end of Ukraine\u2019s 2022 counteroffensive over a year ago, and Ukraine will likely not have the capacity to execute another major counteroffensive, let alone liberate all territory. At the rate Ukraine has advanced over the past year, it would take until well after 2100 to liberate all of its territory. Russia\u2019s rapid offensive in the past few weeks erased Ukrainian advances during their summer 2023 counteroffensive. After months of deliberation, both the US and Ukraine recently passed major bills which will help sustain Ukraine\u2019s defenses through 2024. While war is unpredictable, the United States and Ukraine should prepare for the significant possibility that their interests will soon be best served by negotiating with Russia.\nPossible endgames for Ukraine are often presented as a false dichotomy between total Ukrainian victory and a frozen conflict that would serve as a future \u201claunching pad\u2026for aggression\u201d by Russia. But as US analysts, we should broaden our collective strategic imagination about how the Russia-Ukraine War might end. What lessons can be drawn from the history of war termination? Armed with historical precedent, how can American policymakers secure a favorable endgame for the US and their Ukrainian partners?\nThis white paper is an attempt to clarify what possible negotiated settlements look like, and how various endgames affect the national interests of the four most influential players: Ukraine, Russia, China, and the United States. The participants, Russia and Ukraine, are the two most significant actors, while the US and China have played key supporting roles. The US has furnished Ukraine with military and financial aid, leading a coalition of Western nations. China has supported Russia less directly (and, as of this writing, has not given lethal military aid), but without China\u2019s economic and technological support Russia would struggle to continue the war. While other entities are also important, such as the European members of NATO, the aforementioned countries represent the four unitary actors with the greatest involvement in the war.\nThe paper surveys the history of war termination beginning with World War II, selecting eight cases that exemplify one or more of the following: a meaningful territorial stalemate, an eventual negotiated settlement, and involvement by great-power patrons in an otherwise regional war. Our objective is not merely to survey conflict termination but to apply this history as a guide for how today\u2019s conflict may end. Accordingly, each historical case is \u201cgraded\u201d in terms of its desirability for each actor in the Russia-Ukraine War, describing whether an analogous endgame would satisfy the interests of the United States, Ukraine, Russia, and China. To illuminate which objectives are essential and which can be discounted in negotiations, we taxonomize each actor\u2019s interests as vital, extremely important, important, or merely secondary.\nOur cases take place across eight decades and involve over a dozen distinct countries, from Cambodia and Vietnam to Finland and Russia. Despite the wide variance in time, location, and outcome, we derive six lessons from this history that policymakers can marshal to pursue a favorable ending to today\u2019s war. Each lesson is a broad principle, followed by two detailed recommendations that US and Ukrainian policymakers should heed. While our paper and lessons are directed at the United States and its partners, our recommendations aim for an attainable settlement that Russia and China could sign up for, instead of a mere wish list of Western demands.\nThis white paper attempts to apply history to illuminate possible paths forward but is neither a detailed blueprint for peace nor an intricate playbook for how negotiations should proceed. With any negotiated settlement, the devil is in the details, and questions such as the prosecution of war crimes, repatriation of prisoners of war (POWs), reparations, and specific territorial lines will undoubtedly be debated fiercely by Moscow and Kyiv. The specific contours of any deal will be ironed out at the negotiating table. Additionally, significant negotiations are unlikely to take place in the lame-duck period prior to the US presidential election. Our recommendations are therefore not an immediate call for action but guidelines for policymakers if and when Ukraine decides to negotiate.\nThis paper begins by analyzing the top five national interests that Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and China each have in the war, as they are the belligerents and primary patron states. Next, we examine eight cases from the history of major wars post-World War II, and then discuss the methodology used to select and grade each historical case. We give a brief overview of each, from the roots of conflict to how the war progressed and eventually ended. Particular attention is paid to the eventual settlement and its aftermath. The cases are graded based on how well an analogous deal would address the interests of each actor in the Russia-Ukraine War today. The cases are ordered from least to most optimal, in terms of how their outcome would align with US national interests. We conclude by offering six lessons drawn from the cases, in an attempt to guide US policymakers as Ukraine considers and eventually begins negotiations to bring the largest European land war since World War II to a close.\nDavidson, Kate, Raphael Piliero, Peter Gaber and Joshua Henderson. \u201cFrom Stalemate to Settlement: Lessons from History for Ukraine's Peace.\u201dBelfer Center for Science and International Affairs, June 2024\nDavidson, Kate, Raphael Piliero, Peter Gaber and Joshua Henderson. \u201cFrom Stalemate to Settlement: Lessons from History for Ukraine's Peace.\u201dBelfer Center for Science and International Affairs, June 2024\nFrom Stalemate to Settlement: Lessons from History for Ukraine's Peace\nDavidson, Kate, Raphael Piliero, Peter Gaber and Joshua Henderson. \u201cFrom Stalemate to Settlement: Lessons from History for Ukraine's Peace.\u201dBelfer Center for Science and International Affairs, June 2024\nDavidson, Kate, Raphael Piliero, Peter Gaber and Joshua Henderson. \u201cFrom Stalemate to Settlement: Lessons from History for Ukraine's Peace.\u201dBelfer Center for Science and International Affairs, June 2024\nRussia-Ukraine Report Card\nLessons from Israel\u2019s Forever Wars\nBelfast, Bogot\u00e1, and Beyond: The Good Friday Agreement as a Model for Conflict Resolution?\n",

Since the early 1990s, the US, Europe and other developed economies have employed sanctions on other nations more than 500 times, seeking to assert their influence on the global stage without resorting to military interventions. From nuclear non-proliferation to the promotion of fundamental human rights, the political goals behind such sanctions are diverse and ambitious, while the measures themselves can take many forms. And yet, though sanctions are often intended to serve as a peaceful alternative to military action, their use is not without controversy.\n\nAs the comprehensive trade sanctions on Iraq came to dominate newspaper headlines throughout the 90s, the humanitarian impact of the embargo became hard to ignore. The economic stranglehold of the stringent sanctions saw Iraqi children fall victim to malnutrition and prolonged suffering, while a lack of medical supplies and a shortage of clean water led to one of the worst humanitarian crises in modern history. For many academics, diplomats and activists, the Iraq embargo shone a light on the ethical cost of sanctions, generating widespread caution concerning the future use of such comprehensive measures.\n\nEconomic sanctions are employed by nations seeking to assert their influence on the global stage without resorting to military interventions\n\nEthics aside, however, the proliferation of sanctions cases over the past two decades has also sparked extensive academic debate over their effectiveness as a tool in international diplomacy. In terms of changing behaviour, sanctions have a poor track record, registering a modest 20-30 percent success rate at best.\n\nWith the US currently extending economic measures against both Russia and North Korea, sanctions are again being debated. As they continue to shape 21st-century foreign policy, it is high time to reflect on both the effectiveness and the ethics of this frequently employed policy tool.\n\nA complex history\nThe very first case of sanctions as we now know them occurred some 2,400 years ago, when ancient Athens declared a trade embargo on neighbouring Megara, essentially strangling the city\u2019s economy. After that, sanctions were used sparingly until the 20th century.\n\nIn 1966, the United Nations Security Council took a historic step by imposing its first set of comprehensive sanctions in its 21-year existence. The measures, which were enforced in an effort to undermine Ian Smith\u2019s white supremacist regime in Rhodesia, were soon followed by another set of comprehensive UN sanctions, this time enforced in 1977, in response to South Africa\u2019s apartheid system.\n\nThe history of economic sanctions\n\n432 BC\n\nThe Athenian Empire levied economic sanctions against neighbouring Megara\n\n1960\n\nThe US implemented sanctions against Cuba in an attempt to destabilise the Castro regime\n\n1963\n\nThe US used sanctions to destabilise Vietnamese Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem\n\n1966\n\nThe UN Security Council imposed mandatory sanctions against Rhodesia\n\n1977\n\nThe UN imposed an arms embargo on South Africa in response to its apartheid system\n\n1981\n\nEurope enforced sanctions against Turkey in an attempt\nto restore democracy there\n\n1982\n\nDuring the Falklands War, the UK imposed economic\nand military sanctions against Argentina\n\n1984\n\nThe US first implemented sanctions against Iran over its nuclear ambitions\n\n1999\n\nThe UN imposed sanctions against Afghanistan in an attempt to extradite Osama bin Laden\n\n2002\n\nNorth Korea was subjected to sanctions from the US as a result of its nuclear proliferation\n\nDespite these noteworthy cases, the use of sanctions remained limited in the decades that followed, partially due to the tense geopolitical climate during the Cold War; if the US had imposed sanctions on a nation during that time, the affected country could have turned to the USSR for trade, rendering the measures worse than useless. By 1991, however, the standoff between the superpowers had cooled, and the two nations began working together on international peacekeeping.\n\nDavid Cortright, Director of Policy Studies at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, told World Finance: \u201cAfter the end of the Cold War, there was unprecedented cooperation at the UN Security Council level, and that led to an explosion of UN peacemaking and conflict mediation efforts across the board. This was this unique historical moment with Gorbachev and the transformation of the Soviet Union, combined with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the ensuing international response, that really brought sanctions to the fore.\u201d\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, the sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council largely took the form of far-reaching trade embargoes \u2013 the same \u2018comprehensive\u2019 sanctions referred to previously. As the link between such sanctions and immense civilian suffering became increasingly unavoidable, however, the new millennium saw targeted measures emerge as an alternative to the all-encompassing sanctions of the past. These \u2018smart\u2019 sanctions \u2013 the likes of which are now in use against Russia \u2013 are specifically aimed at high-profile individuals or powerful groups within a targeted country in an effort to reduce the collateral damage and suffering inflicted on vulnerable civilian groups.\n\nLimited impact \nDespite their widespread use on the international stage, economic sanctions are largely ineffective in achieving their objectives. According to leading empirical analyses, between 1915 and 2006, comprehensive sanctions were successful, at best, just 30 percent of the time. What\u2019s more, data has shown that the longer sanctions are in place, the less likely they are to be effective, as the targeted state tends to adapt to its new economic circumstances instead of changing its behaviour.\n\nBut this is not to say sanctions are completely ineffective: in the past half-century, such measures have proved successful in peacefully resolving a number of high-stake political issues. For example, economic sanctions played a crucial role in bringing Iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear ambitions. After 30 years of disruptions to the country\u2019s trade levels, oil production and economic performance, the UN lifted its sanctions on the nation in January 2016, having successfully convinced the Iranian leadership to comply with limits to its uranium enrichment programme.\n\n\u201cIf we go back to the 90s, sanctions were also famously imposed on Libya because of the Lockerbie bombing\u201d, said Cortright. \u201cThe demands were that Libya ceased its support for international terrorism and that it turn over the suspects wanted in connection with the bombings.\u201d\n\nWhile the Gadaffi regime initially refused to cooperate, years of pressure from the US and the UN eventually saw the Libyan leader hand over the suspects for trial, in addition to renouncing the nation\u2019s weapons of mass destruction and ending its support for terrorist activities.\n\nDespite these successes, sanctions have fallen short of achieving their objectives on numerous occasions. From Somalia and Rwanda in the early 1990s to today\u2019s restrictions on Cuba and Russia, economic sanctions ultimately prove ineffective when there is limited international participation in the measures. Cortright explained: \u201cIn cases where the targeted country has other trading options \u2013 which is almost always the case nowadays \u2013 as the volume of world trade and investment grows, unilateral measures have no real impact.\u201d\n\nIn our globalised world, nations are no longer required to be self-sufficient, and are able to profit from a wealth of different trade avenues. As one market closes with the imposition of sanctions, globalisation means the targeted nation can simply shift its economic focus to new markets and trading partners, bypassing sanctions and maintaining a healthy level of trade. This issue of non-participation has largely undercut the current western sanctions imposed on Russia, as the nation remains free to trade with some of Asia\u2019s largest economies.\n\n\u201cAlthough the US and the European Union are supporting the sanctions, there are many other major economies \u2013 such as China, India and South Korea \u2013 that are not participating in the sanctions\u201d, said Christopher Davis, a lecturer in Russian and East Asian Political Economy at Oxford University. \u201cMy calculations are that participants in the sanctions have a GDP totalling around $42trn, whereas non-participants have a total GDP of $31trn.\u201d\n\nThanks to these burgeoning Asian trade partnerships, Russia has effectively created an economic bulwark against western action.\n\nHuman rights\nAside from this question of effectiveness, a significant ethical debate also surrounds the use [TOO LONG, END]\n\n---\nURL: https://www.easternherald.com/2023/01/27/sanctions-and-public-opinion-in-russia/\nTitle: None\nContent:\nReshaping Perspectives and Catalyzing Diplomatic Evolution\n\nSanctions and public opinion in Russia\n\nRussia\u2019s war in Ukraine continues with no end in sight.  Almost a year after the start of a full-scale conflict, one of the most intriguing questions is why the Russian people have yet to respond with a strong protest against the Putin regime\u2019s war.  What is the basis of his power?  Why does the Russian economy still manage not to collapse in the face of unprecedented economic sanctions?  And can Russia continue to resist international pressure to deprive it of the oil and gas revenues that are fueling the war in Ukraine?Invited by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Polina Ivanova, Foreign Correspondent for the Financial Times (FT) covering Russia, Ukraine and Central Asia, covered both the Russian invasion of Ukraine  and the changes in Russia itself, from the Kremlin\u2019s crackdown to the consequences of sanctions and attempts to circumvent them \u2013 shared his impressions of Russia, after his recent trip to Moscow.As a business journalist, she tried to explain why, despite the enormous pressure of sanctions directed against Russia in key areas \u2013 international law, finance, trade, technology, energy and against Russian elites \u2013 the Kremlin succeeded to deal with all of this.Western expectations have yet to come true, but sanctions continue to apply\u201dThe West hoped for the immediate impact of sanctions on the economy, for example, on the development of an inflationary spiral in finance, but this expectation did not materialize,\u201d noted Polina Ivanova.  \u201cIn addition, it was expected that the sanctions would have an impact on public opinion, especially members of the elite who will find that their way of life has changed, they will not be able to go on vacation, for example, in Monaco or elsewhere\u2026 And also the middle class, who will find that certain products are no longer available. And this change in public opinion in Russia will make it more difficult for Putin to continue the war,\u201d Polina recalled.She believes that \u201cin the short term, these expectations were unrealistic\u201d.Indeed, despite the sanctions, Rosstat says Russia\u2019s GDP fell by just 2.1% over most of the last year.  At the same time, most economists are convinced that the Russian economy will face years of deterioration, contraction and regression.Polina Ivanova agrees with this.\u201cMost of the restrictions on oil and gas came later.  Given that oil and gas make up nearly half of Russia\u2019s budget revenue, it became clear that only now would sanctions begin to work.  It will take longer for the West to get the results it wants,\u201d the FT correspondent noted.The role of so-called \u201csystemic liberals\u201d and \u201ctechnocrats\u201d was critical, according to Polina Ivanova.\u201dThose in Russia who believed in the free market and the integration of the country into the world economy\u2026 first opposed the war, were appalled by its outbreak, and then went to great lengths to keep the economy afloat and thus enabled the continued sponsorship of this war. They made a sort of \u201ctransition\u201d, from being horror in relation to the war, to becoming first of all, in a way, its \u201d assistants\u201d, and, at the end, his \u201caccomplices\u201d, underlines not without regret Polina Ivanova.She gave examples of how the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, after the start of a large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine  , banned the withdrawal of money from banks for individuals, stopped the outflow capital of the country, eased the blows of the end of global payment systems in Russia, and did many other things that are likely to later, according to Polina Ivanova, her leadership \u201cwill be vindicated by the fact that they have tried to protect most people in Russia, who have long been below the poverty line.\u201dMoscow is not the rest of Russia, but changes are beginning there\u201dOnly a small percentage of Russians, something like 7%, regularly traveled abroad for holidays, but we focus on the mood and nature of life of middle-class Russians, and especially in Moscow, because that\u2019s what the Kremlin pays attention to. That\u2019s where mood swings are important and can be politically sensitive,\u201d Ivanova said.The FT correspondent tried to describe what Moscow looks like at the moment.  To do this, she suggests \u201cputting yourself in the place of a representative of the middle class of Muscovites\u201d:\u201dThe supermarket you went to in central Moscow looks pretty much the same as usual, western products are still there. You can buy your favorite European products, wines, your favorite western clothing brands, except that the prices have gone up a bit. You can walk down the street, look at United Colors of Benetton, look at other shops. Yes, you can\u2019t go to Starbucks, it has changed its name and McDonald\u2019s, but there is no there are no huge, tangible changes,\u201d Polina said.She quoted Alexandra Prokopenko (freelance journalist and expert on Russian economic policy, in the past \u2013 adviser to the management of the Central Bank of Russia \u2013 about GA): \u201cBillboards with portraits of the heroes of\u201d the special operation \u201care hanging all over Moscow, and people are still eating fresh oysters. The war is becoming like some kind of TV show.\u201dHowever, their morale changed drastically.\u201cFrom the perspective of a Russian Muscovite, it is as if an atomic bomb had exploded in Ukraine, and the shock waves had not yet reached Moscow, but the radiation was already leaking.  The consequences of war are already happening in families, in people\u2019s minds, deep inside, on a personal level, on a moral level, on a psychological level\u201d, Polina tries to describe the mood in Moscow, \u201cThe only thing that catches people\u2019s attention every day is empty tables, empty workspaces.If you walk into the office, you can see how many people have left.  And although estimates of how many Muscovites have left vary widely, people are constantly talking about it among themselves.  They talk about their children who left to escape mobilization, or simply acquaintances who left Russia forever.  To some extent, it\u2019s an empty city.Parallel imports and the do-it-yourself economyPolina told how the \u201cparallel import freedom\u201d regime announced by the Kremlin works.\u201cThese supply chains are very unstable.  You can\u2019t build an economy on that.  And it works especially in consumer goods.  For example, despite the fact that Apple defiantly left the Russian market, there were no problems with delivery and meeting demand for the new iPhone in the fall,\u201d she said. .\u201cA European company is being created which would have ties to Russia, and it is run by people with European passports.  She buys the necessary goods.  They will then be transported via, for example, Kazakhstan or via Belarus to Russia.  Sometimes it works differently.  For example, a company can contact a company in Kazakhstan.  So, for example, you have a company in Kazakhstan that was ordering a certain type of computer equipment from the United States, and now it is starting to order a hundred times more than the year before.  And then, the \u201csuperfluous\u201d goes to the company that \u201cneeds\u201d it in Russia\u201d, explained Polina Ivanova.The investigative reporter also explained how the oil is transported on tankers that \u201cgo with their radars turned off \u2013 the system tracking their movement \u2013 and then, somewhere in the middle of the ocean, these tankers pump oil from the \u2018to another\u2019.\u201dThe tankers built in the 80s are unusable and used to be sent to the smelter, but now they are being bought to transport oil as a sort of \u2018shadow fleet\u2019. The world is trying to start tracking these phantom transports, but their numbers are increasing,\u201d the journalist said.\u201dMysterious\u201d Russian public opinion and propaganda10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Levada Center is a an independent Russian public opinion research organization \u2013 conducted a survey and it showed that around 70% of Russians support the war  .World Values \u200b\u200bSurvey under the International Social Research Program, published a report stating that \u201cRussian patriotism is unique\u201d  .The two organizations said that \u201cRussians feel compelled to support their country whether it does the right thing or not.\u201dMoreover, according to research data, Russians consistently expressed \u201cmore than people in other countries, a willingness to sacrifice their material well-being in the name of their country\u2019s military might.\u201dPolina Ivanova stressed that, nevertheless, the basis for the formation of such a position, in her opinion, is \u201cthe strong influence of propaganda\u201d.It\u2019s also important to understand, says Polina, that there are \u201ca lot of passive people in Russia who don\u2019t look for alternatives to propaganda\u201d on the internet or on YouTube.\u201cThe vast majority of these people are used to following the message delivered to them. Does this group of people know that they can \u2018open that door and get them out of the propaganda bubble\u2019? Polina asks.\u201d Kremlin propaganda is quite insidious: it makes people believe that there is no other reality than the one in which they exist.\u201d\u201dAlso, there is a paranoid atmosphere in Russia at the moment. There are no more mass protests, because the tactic of the authorities is: the police come and take people away from the crowd. You can and would like to stay and be with them but you know that one in ten people will be taken away and detained. They don\u2019t need mass arrests and mass detentions to scare people. All they want is cases and examples that will really scare people, so we don\u2019t necessarily see a lot of arrests. We saw many arrests of people during the early anti-war protests, and although many were later released, some were sentenced to long prison terms of 6, 7 and even 8 years. And these examples are enough to make anyone think: well, will I be here to be the next?

The White House is listening.\n\nBy Anton Troianovski\n\nReporting from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\n\nThe Russian government\u2019s top investment manager, who has Harvard and McKinsey credentials and fluent English, brought a simple printout to Tuesday\u2019s talks with the Trump administration in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIts message: By pulling out of Russia in outrage over the invasion of Ukraine, American companies had walked away from piles of cold, hard cash.\n\n\u201cLosses of U.S. companies by industry,\u201d read the document, which Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, showed to a New York Times reporter. \u201cTotal losses,\u201d one of the columns said. The sum at the bottom: $324 billion.\n\nIn appealing to President Trump, the Kremlin has zeroed in on his desire to make a profit. President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday praised the U.S. delegation in Riyadh for not criticizing Russia as previous administrations did \u2014 there was no \u201ccondemnation of what was done in the past,\u201d he said. He added that beyond geopolitics, the two countries were now moving toward deeper engagement on space, the economy and \u201cour joint work on global energy markets.\u201d\n\nSergey V.

After Ukraine suggested the possibility of natural resource deals to Mr. Trump, his treasury secretary pushed to have the country sign away half its mineral wealth. And Mr. Trump continues to portray American allies as freeloaders, threatening more tariffs and demanding they pay more for their own defense.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Following years of no communication, Russian and American delegations held a meeting in the Saudi capital Riyadh. The sides discussed rebuilding relations, preparations for a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, as well as prospects for resolving the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nRussian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov said that the teams had a \"very serious conversation on all issues.\"\n\nTASS has put together the highlights from the talks.\n\nAbout the venue\n\nThe Russian-US talks began around 7:30 a.m. GMT in one of the palaces of the royal family: Diriyah in the Albasateen complex. The meeting lasted 4 1/2 hours.\n\nKremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Saudi Arabia was chosen as the venue for the talks because it suits both sides.\n\nMembers of the delegations\n\nRussia was represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov and Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, and special envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff comprised the US team.\n\nSubjects of the talks\n\nThe sides discussed rebuilding the entirety of Russia-US relations, preparations for a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, and possible negotiations on a settlement in Ukraine.\n\nStatements by Russia\n\nUshakov said that the delegations had a \"very serious conversation on all issues.\" However, it is still hard to say that the positions of Russia and the US are getting closer, according to the official. He also said Russia and the US agreed to \"take into account each other's interests.\" According to the aide, a date for a meeting between Putin and Trump hasn\u2019t been set and it is unlikely that it will take place next week. He said it is not yet clear who would be appointed as negotiators on Ukrainian settlement, as the president has yet to make a decision.\n\nDmitriev said following the talks that the Russian and US teams treated each other with respect, as equals.\n\n\"It is too early to talk about compromises. We can say that the sides started communicating with each other, started listening to each other, started the dialog,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Dmitriev, the countries also discussed potential economic cooperation and energy prices.\n\nStatements by the US\n\nRubio and Lavrov agreed to appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible, State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. They also agreed to establish a consultation mechanism to address irritants to the bilateral relationship and lay the groundwork for future cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and economic and investment opportunities.\n\n\"One phone call followed by one meeting is not sufficient to establish enduring peace,\" she said separately.\n\nReaction from the West\n\nForeign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova Moscow said the reaction of Western countries to the Russian-US talks is nervous and even hysterical. She also said there is now an \"unprecedented phenomenon in international relations: efforts to impose one\u2019s own participation in the negotiation process.\"\n\n\n\n---\nError for URL https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-wealth-fund-chief-will-meet-us-delegation-saudi-arabia-source-riyadh-2025-02-17/: HTTP 401: Unauthorized\n\n---\nError for URL https://www.reuters.com/business/russian-wealth-fund-sees-us-companies-returning-2025-2025-02-19/: HTTP 401: Unauthorized\n",

Following high-level talks in Riyadh, both countries agreed to work towards normalizing relations and addressing the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Among the primary outcomes of this meeting was an agreement to restore diplomatic missions and appoint ambassadors, a move aimed at reducing the barriers that have hindered diplomatic communication since the heights of tensions post-2022 invasion of Ukraine <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>. This re-engagement signifies not only a potential thaw in relations but also a recognition of mutual interests that can lead to collaborative approaches toward pressing global issues.\n\nOne of the most discussed potential outcomes of improved relations is the resolution of the Ukraine conflict. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio noted that they could form high-level teams to explore paths to sustainable peace, particularly concerning Moscow's security concerns and Western military presence in Eastern Europe <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>.

The discussions hinted at the possibility of returning American companies to Russia, which could rejuvenate trade ties that have been deteriorated by sanctions and diplomatic isolation <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>.

This economic renaissance is contingent upon a broader geopolitical agreement that prioritizes diplomatic engagement over confrontation, suggesting that the commitment to economic stability could serve as a cornerstone for long-term partnership <cite>https://www.russiamatters.org/analysis/optimism-improved-us-russian-relations-necessary-should-remain-cautious</cite>.\n\nImproving relations are likely to redefine global security dynamics, particularly regarding nuclear non-proliferation and counterterrorism efforts where both nations have overlapping interests <cite>https://www.csis.org/analysis/key-challenges-us-russian-relations-are-collaborative-approaches-possible</cite>.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the American delegation, which included National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. The Russian side was represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, along with other senior officials, indicating a serious attempt to restore dialogue between the two countries that had been nearly severed due to the ongoing war and subsequent sanctions.<cite>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-and-u-s-officials-meet-in-saudi-arabia-without-ukraine-to-discuss-improving-ties-and-ending-war</cite>.\n\nDuring the four-hour negotiations, both sides agreed to pursue three main objectives: to restore staffing at their respective embassies, to create a high-level team to facilitate peace talks regarding Ukraine, and to explore potential avenues for enhanced diplomatic and economic cooperation.

During the four-hour meeting, both sides committed to restoring staff at their respective embassies and establishing high-level teams to facilitate ongoing negotiations concerning Ukraine, an indication of a strategic shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump <cite>https://www.rferl.org/a/us-russia-saudi-ukraine-peace-talks-riyadh-rubio-lavrov/33319124.html<cite>.\n\nThe discussions in Riyadh were framed as exploratory talks that set the stage for further negotiations, including a potential in-person summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin <cite>https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/18/russia-and-us-agree-work-towards-improving-ties-and-ending-ukraine-war-landmark-talks.html<cite>. Lavrov characterized the meeting as \u201cvery useful,\u201d expressing optimism that the U.S. was beginning to understand Russia\u2019s position <cite>https://www.rferl.org/a/us-russia-saudi-ukraine-peace-talks-riyadh-rubio-lavrov/33319124.html<cite>. However, the absence of Ukrainian representatives at these talks raised significant concerns in Kyiv and among European allies, who feared being sidelined in the negotiation process <cite>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-and-u-s-officials-meet-in-saudi-arabia-without-ukraine-to-discuss-improving-ties-and-ending-war<cite>.\n\nAs the talks unfolded, there was evident willingness from both nations to explore joint energy ventures, reflecting a mutual interest in strengthening economic ties against the backdrop of global energy challenges <cite>https://trendsnewsline.com/2025/02/19/us-and-russia-explore-joint-energy-ventures-in-saudi-talks/<cite>. This collaboration angle is significant given Saudi Arabia's role as a major oil producer and its ongoing strategic relationships with both Washington and Moscow. The U.S. and Russia\u2019s initiative to engage on economic matters\u2014beyond the immediate issue of Ukraine\u2014demonstrates an overarching aim to stabilize bilateral ties and shift away from years of diplomatic isolation characterized by sanctions and hostility <cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html<cite>.\n\nIn summary, the high-level discussions in Saudi Arabia signal a dramatic shift in U.S.-Russia relations, one that seeks to re-establish dialogues and explore mutual interests in a variety of sectors, including energy. Nonetheless, the exclusion of Ukraine from these crucial talks poses a significant threat to its sovereignty, raising alarms about the future of diplomatic negotiations and alliances in the region <cite>https://www.globalresearch.ca/global-implications-18-february-2025-us-russia-riyadh-meeting/5880542<cite>. With ongoing military actions in Ukraine and the evolving geopolitical landscape, the implications of these talks will likely resonate throughout international relations for years to come <cite>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/19/putin-rates-us-talks-highly-says-russia-ready-to-negotiate-over-ukraine<cite>."

    "content": "The relationship between the United States and Russia has fundamentally transformed, particularly in the context of NATO and European security, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and associated geopolitical tensions. NATO has officially designated Russia as the \"most significant and direct threat\" to its member states following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This shift stemmed from a continuous series of aggressive actions by Russia, including the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and military interventions in Georgia, which raised alarms about its intentions towards NATO allies, especially those in Eastern Europe <cite>https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50090.htm?selectedLocale=us<cite>.\n\nIn response to this threat, NATO has enhanced its collective defense measures, committing to increased military readiness and presence along its eastern flank. For example, NATO has deployed thousands of additional troops to Eastern Europe, establishing multinational battlegroups intended to deter potential Russian aggression. By 2024, approximately 40,000 NATO troops were reported to be positioned in Eastern member states, supported by significant air and naval assets, further solidifying the alliance's collective defense posture <cite>https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50090.htm?selectedLocale=us<cite>.\n\nThe implications of this intensifying conflict extend to military spending and defense frameworks. The European allies are reevaluating their defense budgets, with many committing to increase their military expenditures in line with NATO's guideline of 2% of GDP. As of mid-2023, NATO members recognized the necessity of substantial contributions to bolster their military capabilities, drawing lessons from operational deficiencies unveiled by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine <cite>https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/nato-priorities-initial-lessons-from-the-russia-ukraine-war/<cite>. Furthermore, the war has highlighted the need for comprehensive modernization of European forces, including investments in high-intensity conflict capabilities, anti-armored defenses, and improved logistical support to ensure sustained military readiness amidst prolonged conflict scenarios <cite>https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/nato-priorities-initial-lessons-from-the-russia-ukraine-war/<cite>.\n\nThe ongoing crisis has also disrupted NATO-Russia dialogue mechanisms, particularly the NATO-Russia Council, which has not convened since the invasion, signaling a complete breakdown in cooperative security efforts that had previously characterized the relationship. This has necessitated a reevaluation of NATO's strategic concepts, as the alliance must now prepare for a future in which conventional warfare and threat proliferation by Russia become normative <cite>https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/a-nato-strategy-for-countering-russia/<cite>. As NATO seeks to reinforce its deterrent posture, the interplay of these military dynamics within the wider European context reflects a significant escalation in defensive capabilities amid a profound transformation in transatlantic security architecture <cite>https://www.gmfus.org/news/nato-and-russia-after-invasion-ukraine<cite>."

    "content": "The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 triggered a profound transformation in U.S.-Russia relations, which reached a nadir not seen since the Cold War. President Biden characterized the invasion as \"naked aggression against Ukraine,\" leading to widespread international condemnation and a swift response in the form of severe economic sanctions against Russia <cite>https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-announce-new-measures-response-russian-invasion-ukraine-rcna17523</cite>. These sanctions targeted Russian banks, elites, and crucial industries, thereby crippling Moscow's ability to acquire advanced technology essential for defense and key sectors <cite>https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-announce-new-measures-response-russian-invasion-ukraine-rcna17523</cite>. Concurrently, the Biden administration assured NATO allies of its unwavering commitment to their defense, emphasizing that while no U.S. troops would enter Ukraine, decisive actions would be taken to protect NATO territories should the conflict spill over <cite>https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-announce-new-measures-response-russian-invasion-ukraine-rcna17523</cite>.\n\nFurthermore, the war prompted the U.S. to reconsider its diplomatic stance. Notably, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's recent meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Saudi Arabia illustrates a shift towards diplomatic engagement, albeit without Ukrainian representation, signaling a desire to re-establish bilateral talks <cite>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/18/russia-ukraine-war-riyadh-talks-trump-putin-rubio/5f764eb4-edc0-11ef-bd80-8f2ac5c75a8a_story.html</cite>. This meeting highlights the ongoing complexities in U.S.-Russia relations; while Biden's administration initially aimed to isolate Russia as a punitive measure for its invasion, the ramifications of the war necessitate a re-evaluation of the approach, especially considering the calls for a negotiated resolution from various stakeholders in the international community <cite>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/18/russia-ukraine-war-riyadh-talks-trump-putin-rubio/5f764eb4-edc0-11ef-bd80-8f2ac5c75a8a_story.html</cite>. \n\nAdditionally, the war has radicalized public opinion in both nations, with the U.S. framing the conflict as a battle between democracy and authoritarianism, thereby solidifying bipartisan support for Ukraine. The sustained Russian campaign against Ukraine, including recent drone strikes that injured civilians, reflects an aggressive strategy that deepens the U.S.'s commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity <cite>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/02/18/russia-ukraine-war-riyadh-talks-trump-putin-rubio/5f764eb4-edc0-11ef-bd80-8f2ac5c75a8a_story.html</cite>. In conclusion, the invasion not only altered the immediate political landscape but also reshaped the strategic underpinnings of U.S.-Russia relations, introducing a mix of punitive sanctions, diplomatic engagements, and an enduring commitment to support Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression."

    "content": "The relationship between the United States and Russia has recently undergone a significant transformation, characterized by a remarkable diplomatic shift aimed at resolving the protracted conflict in Ukraine. On February 18, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Saudi Arabia to discuss a framework for peace and the potential normalization of bilateral relations. They articulated a commitment to restoring staffing at their respective embassies and forming a high-level team to facilitate ongoing discussions about ending the war in Ukraine. This meeting marked the most extensive dialogue between the two nations in over three years, signaling a departure from the isolationist policies that had defined the U.S. approach during the Biden administration, which had focused heavily on sanctions against Russia and military support for Ukraine<cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>.\n\nRubio emphasized that the talks were just the beginning of what would require further engagement and dialogue, outlining three central goals: diplomatic normalization, the establishment of a high-level team for peace negotiations, and the exploration of closer economic cooperation<cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html</cite>. Lavrov echoed these sentiments, noting that both countries had begun to understand each other's positions better. This collaborative tone starkly contrasts with the previous strategy, which had centered on punitive measures against Russia following its aggressive actions in Ukraine since 2022 and the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Such aggression had driven U.S.-Russia relations to their lowest point in decades, prompting severe diplomatic and economic sanctions that isolated Moscow from the West<cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>.\n\nThe U.S. decision to engage directly with Russia regarding Ukraine has raised concerns among allies, particularly Ukraine itself, which was notably absent from the talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed dissatisfaction at being excluded from discussions that directly impact his country's sovereignty. In a statement reflecting his frustrations, he postponed his planned visit to Saudi Arabia, indicating that Kyiv would not accept any outcomes from negotiations it did not partake in<cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>. European allies, including France, convened an emergency meeting to address these developments, emphasizing the need for inclusivity in peace talks as a core component of the international response to the conflict, which had previously relied on consultations involving European nations and Kyiv under Biden's administration<cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>.\n\nAs Russia and the U.S. embark on this renewed diplomatic engagement, the focus appears not solely on resolving the Ukrainian crisis but also on broader economic and geopolitical partnership opportunities that might emerge if the conflict is successfully addressed. Rubio described the potential for collaboration on issues of common interest as an \"incredible opportunity\" for both nations, underlining a shift toward a focus on diplomacy rather than confrontation. Nonetheless, this pivot is not without its complications, as military actions in Ukraine continue, with reports of Russian drone attacks highlighting the ongoing violence that complicates the path to peace<cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html</cite>. The newly established dialogue serves as a crucial test of whether a pragmatic approach can overcome the decades-long tensions that have historically defined U.S.-Russia relations."

He said repeatedly that Ukraine\u2019s leaders never should have allowed the war to begin, suggesting the country should have been willing to make concessions to Russia before the 2022 invasion.\n\u201cToday I heard, \u2018Oh, well, we weren\u2019t invited.\u2019 Well, you been there for three years. You should have ended it three years\u201d ago, Trump said duringa news conference at his Florida residence. \u201cYou should have never started it. You could have made a deal.\u201d\nTies between Russia and the U.S. have fallen to their lowest level in decades in recent years \u2014 a rift that has been widening ever since Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and only worsened after Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion.\nThe U.S., along with European nations, imposed araft of sanctionson Russia in an effort to damage its economy. And embassies in Washington and Moscow have been hit hard by expulsions of large numbers of diplomats, as well as other restrictions.\nRubio said Tuesday that ending the war in Ukraine could \u201cunlock the door\u201d for \u201cincredible opportunities\u201d to partner with the Russians on issues of common interest \u201cthat hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term.\u201d\nHis comments were further evidence of the remarkable U.S. reversal on Russia after years in which Trump\u2019s predecessor, Joe Biden, led international efforts to isolate Moscow.\nTuesday\u2019s meeting was meant to pave the way for a summit between Trump and Putin. After the talks ended, Ushakov and Waltz said no date has been set yet for that summit. Ushakov told Russian television that a meeting was \u201cunlikely\u201d to take place next week, while Waltz said he thought it could be arranged in the coming weeks.\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, Lavrov mentioned the same three goals as Rubio and said that Washington and Moscow agreed to appoint representatives to carry out \u201cregular consultations\u201d on Ukraine.\n\u201cI have reason to believe that the American side has started to better understand our position\u201d the Russian foreign minister said.\nThe meeting marked the most extensive contact between the two countries since Moscow\u2019s Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. Lavrov and then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkentalked briefly on the sidelines of a G-20meeting in India nearly two years ago, but tensions remained high.\nThe recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Ukraine and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that won\u2019t be favorable to them.\nKyiv\u2019s absence at Tuesday\u2019s talksrankled many Ukrainians, and France called anemergency meetingof European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to discuss the war. Kyiv\u2019s participation in such talks was a bedrock of U.S. policy under Biden.\nU.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said the talks were aimed at determining how serious the Russians are about achieving peace and whether detailed negotiations can start.\nRubio said Tuesday that there would be \u201cengagement and consultation with Ukraine, with our partners in Europe and others. But ultimately, the Russian side will be indispensable to this effort.\u201d\nRubio also said ending the conflict would require concessions from all sides and that Washington \u201cis not going to predetermine\u201d what those concessions would be.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegsethsaid last weekthat NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia \u2014 twokey items on Putin\u2019s wish list.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Trump and Zelenskyy following Monday\u2019s European meeting.\n\u201cWe seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine,\u201d Macron wrote on social media platform X. \u201cTo achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,\u201d he said and vowed to \u201cwork on this together with all Europeans, Americans and Ukrainians.\u201d\nThe meeting at the Diriyah Palace in the Saudi capital of Riyadh also highlighted de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s efforts to be a major diplomatic player, burnishing a reputation severely tarnished by the 2018killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nSaudi state media described the talks as happening at the prince\u2019s direction. Like the neighboring United Arab Emirates, the prince has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine, both through the OPEC+ oil cartel and diplomatically as well.\nSaudi Arabia has also helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in 2023.\nBut Zelenskyy postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the talks since Ukrainian officials weren\u2019t invited. His visit was rescheduled for March 10.\nMeanwhile, Russia continued to pummel Ukraine with drones, according to Kyiv\u2019s military. The Ukrainian air force said Russian troops launched a barrage of 176 drones at Ukraine overnight, most of which were destroyed or disabled by jamming.\nOne Russian drone struck a residential building in Dolynska in the Kirovohrad region, wounding a mother and her two children and prompting an evacuation of 38 apartments, the regional administration reported.\n___\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

During the early 20th century, infectious organisms in tainted food or fetid water exacted a frightening toll on children; in some places, up to30 percentdied before their first birthday. In those days, there was often little more to offer children suffering from dehydration and diarrhea thanmilkteeming with harmful bacteria or so-calledsoothing syrupslaced with morphine and alcohol.\nSince then, deaths during childhood went from commonplace torare. Partly as a result, theaverage human life span doubled, granting us, on average, the equivalent of a whole extra life to live. The field of public health is primarily responsible for this exceptional achievement.\nMedicine revolves around the care of individual patients; public health, by contrast, works to protect and improve the health of entire populations, whether small communities or large countries. This encompasses researching how to prevent injuries, developing policies to address health disparities, and, of course, tackling disease outbreaks.\nGeorge Whipple, aco-founderof the Harvard School of Public Health, proclaimed in 1914inThe Atlanticthat \u201cone of the greatest events of the dawning twentieth century is the triumph of man over his microscopic foes.\u201d Even he\u2019d likely be shocked by the success of public health over the past century.\nFrom the May 1914 issue: The broadening science of sanitation\nBut as the coronavirus pandemic wanes, the field of public health has come under a barrage of criticism. Some arecalling to curtail the field\u2019s power. Even many of public health\u2019s strongest proponents are disappointed with how the profession navigated the pandemic.\nWhile it is essential to learn from mistakes of the recent past, such rhetoric could have awful consequences. Our public-health workforce is already burdened bymassive attrition. Simultaneously, a growing body of legislation and litigation is chipping away at public health\u2019s ability to address current and future health threats. Politicians have accused health experts of being \u201cwrong about almost everything\u201d during the pandemic. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who fundraised his reelection bid with \u201c#FireFauci\u201d ads, introduced abillto eliminate the position that Anthony Fauci recently left at the National Institutes of Health and to split the agency in three.\nPublic health wasn\u2019t perfect during the pandemic; itnever has been. But its remarkable track record\u2014on the provision of clean water, prevention of childhood lead poisoning, tobacco-cessation programs, vaccine development and promotion, and much more\u2014has driven unprecedented gains in better health and life expectancy worldwide. Public health saves lives, and is an essential component of protecting and improving our collective health.\nExacting revenge on the field following a devastating pandemic may feel satisfying to some people, but curtailing public health\u2019s programs, credibility, and funding will not help anyone. What itwilldo is put a century of progress at risk.\nIunderstand whythe backlash has been so intense. There were errors at many steps. The CDCbotched testingfor SARS-CoV-2 early in 2020, delaying our ability to track the virus from day one. Much of the communication about masks and vaccines from public-health officials wasunclearand unhelpful. We too often failed to put our best public-health knowledge to use in schools to keep kids learning while reducing spread, leading to closures that went on far longer than necessary; at bars and restaurants down the block, meanwhile, life continued as normal. The full extent of the damage done to a generation of students will not be known for years to come.\nBut at the same time, while critics love to talk about everything public health got wrong throughout the pandemic, they rarely stop to recognize all that it got right\u2014and under truly challenging circumstances. For example, when asked to reflect on the COVID-19-vaccine rollout, many will note the confusion about eligibility or countless hours spent frantically clicking \u201cRefresh\u201d on appointment sites. But the fact is that in just six months, almost half of the U.S. population got vaccinated. As a health-care provider, I can say that the effects were dramatic: We quickly saw fewer and fewer patients arriving with severe illness. The phenomenal achievement of the vaccination rollout\u2014coordinated by federal, state, and local public-health agencies\u2014averted millions of deaths from COVID-19 to date and serves as a blueprint for how to mobilize mass-vaccination campaigns in the future.\nRead: 23 pandemic decisions that actually went right\nRapid antigen testing feels routine now, but consider how widespread and accessible it became, and how quickly. For the first time, people are able to easily diagnose a respiratory infection at home without a doctor, helping prevent spread and avoiding unnecessary office visits. At the outset of the pandemic, we relied on time-consuming, expensive, and severely limited PCR tests. Within months, at-home tests were approved, and now hundreds of millions have been produced, shipped, and used across the country. This helped improve timely access to antivirals such as Paxlovid, which saved more lives yet. And the lessons learned from using rapid tests in this pandemic will help bolster preparedness and response in future disease outbreaks. Additionally, at-home rapid tests for other respiratory pathogens, such asinfluenzaand respiratory syncytial virus, areon the immediate horizon.\nThe tendency to focus on public health\u2019s slipups rather than its successes is not new. Americans have long undervalued public health: We almost never have to question if the food we consume or the medicines we\u2019re prescribed will inadvertently sicken us and send us to the hospital. This disconnect between what we value and what truly benefits us becomes clearer when we compare public health with the field of medicine.\nThroughout the pandemic, while public-health officials were met with pitchforks\u2014forced out of their jobor taunted withdeath threats\u2014health-care providers (like myself) were applauded with pots and pans, in recognition of the challenges we faced on COVID\u2019s front lines.\nThis is a classically American pattern. Public health is focused on the health of communities; medicine, on individuals. Almost all of the more than $4 trillion spent on health care annually supports individual patient care, with only4 percentof funding going to public health. This is strikingly inefficient and helps explain why the U.S. has one of thelowest life expectanciesand the highestratesof maternal and infant mortality among high-income nations.\nArmed with a growing array of treatments and diagnostic tools, medicine has gotten much better at treating infections. But it can still do very little to stop a novel pandemic, and in March 2020, its ability to save lives from COVID wasn\u2019t markedly better than during the 1918 influenza pandemic. America needs a robust field of public health to do what medicine cannot: keep people safe from emerging pathogens, environmental toxins, and gun violence. Medicine can treat people who are sick, but only public health can preserve their health in the first place.\nIt\u2019s easy to assume that progress in public health is linear, and that over time the world\u2019s population will only get healthier. But we\u2019re witnessing profound challenges that may turn back the field\u2019s achievements.\nIn 1972, the Noble-laureate immunologist Macfarlane Burnet predicted, \u201cThe most likely forecast about the future of infectious disease is thatit will be very dull.\u201d His optimism seemed justified in 1980, when the World Health Organizationdeclared smallpox eradicated.\nBut the triumph over microbes was short-lived. In 1981, a CDCMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Reportoutlined the first five cases of what would eventually be called HIV/AIDs, a global pandemic that has since killed40 millionpeople worldwide. More recently, outbreaks ofmeasles,polio, and other diseases most of us know only from playingOregon Trailpose new threats and challenges. Syphilis cases in the U.S. are at theirhighest level in 70 years.\nThe anger directed at public health following the pandemic could further weaken the field, accelerating this backslide. Dozens of states have implementedrestrictionson public-health powers, intended to limit what politicians regard as the field\u2019s overreach during the pandemic. This means greater gatekeeping and restrictions on the role of public-health authorities by politicians, a flawed andproblematic setupin the midst of crises.\nThe problem isn\u2019t coming only from politicians.

    "content": "The prospects for conflict resolution in Ukraine have notably evolved in recent months, particularly in the wake of significant diplomatic engagements between the United States and Russia. In February 2025, high-level talks took place in Saudi Arabia, where U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed strategies for ending the ongoing war in Ukraine. This dialogue marked the first substantial contact between the two nations since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, signaling a remarkable shift from years of isolation following the invasion. Rubio highlighted that both sides agreed to establish diplomatic teams to explore a resolution to the conflict, indicating a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations that had been largely strained due to the war and subsequent sanctions on Moscow <cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/world/europe/us-russia-saudi-ukraine.html</cite>.\n\nDuring these discussions, the U.S. officials indicated a willingness to consider concessions from both Russia and Ukraine, a departure from previous hardline stances. They acknowledged that discussions about territorial control and security guarantees would be essential to any peace framework. This is a crucial aspect of the negotiations, given Russia's annexation of several regions in Ukraine and its insistence on Ukraine\u2019s neutrality regarding NATO <cite>https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/europe/us-russia-riyadh-talks-intl/index.html</cite>. Notably, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed opposition to any outcomes from the talks without Ukraine's involvement, emphasizing that Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be prioritized <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>.\n\nFurthermore, Ukraine's government has been actively pursuing a diplomatic initiative to formalize its peace framework, which includes ten principles aimed at rallying international support. The initiative is characterized by Ukraine's insistence on a multilateral approach to negotiations, reflecting lessons learned from previous engagements that resulted in ineffective outcomes, such as the Normandy Format talks post-Crimea annexation <cite>https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/08/ukraine-advancing-its-peace-plan-us-can-help</cite>. Recent suggestions from U.S. Defense Secretary that NATO membership for Ukraine might not be feasible have further complicated the situation, indicating a potential shift in the American stance regarding Kyiv's aspirations <cite>https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2025-02-18/top-russian-and-us-officials-are-set-to-hold-talks-on-ukraine-war-without-kyiv</cite>.\n\nThe geopolitical landscape will significantly impact the trajectory of these negotiations. Impending developments in U.S.-Russia relations could redefine how the West responds to Russia's aggressive posture and its military actions in Ukraine. Should the dialogues lead to a substantial agreement, it could signify a broader shift away from confrontation and toward a cooperative security framework in Europe <cite>https://www.brookings.edu/events/american-foreign-policy-toward-ukraine-russia-and-nato-beyond-2024/</cite>. However, the absence of a cohesive strategy among Ukraine's European partners and a lack of Ukrainian representation in pivotal talks could hinder effective progress, underscoring the complexities of establishing a sustainable peace in the region <cite>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/3274021-diplomatic-moves-us-russia-talks-signal-hope-for-ending-ukraine-conflict</cite>."

    "content": "The evolving dynamics of U.S.-Russia relations, especially in the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, underscore the importance of inclusive diplomacy that actively involves Ukraine in negotiations aimed at ending the conflict. Recent high-level discussions between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, occurred without the participation of Ukrainian officials, raising concerns about the implications for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This significant diplomatic shift from the Trump administration, which aims to re-establish ties with Russia, has been shaped by Trump's assertion that peace negotiations could occur without direct involvement from Kyiv, indicating a potential sidelining of Ukraine in critical discussions affecting its future <cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/business/media/trump-russia-right-wing-media.html<cite>.\n\nThe absence of Ukraine from these discussions has not only led to fears of an unfavorable peace deal being negotiated without its input but also highlighted a stark departure from the previous U.S. policy that emphasized the mantra of \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\" Diplomatic talks have occurred against a backdrop of Russia's aggressive military actions in Ukraine, including recent drone strikes, which concurrently amplify the urgency for negotiations while complicating the prospects for a stable diplomatic resolution <cite>https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/europe/us-russia-riyadh-talks-intl/index.html<cite>. The Ukrainian government, led by President Volodymyr Zelensky, has firmly opposed any outcome that arises without its involvement, reinforcing the need for Ukrainian agency in negotiating its own future <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/<cite>.\n\nAdditionally, European allies have expressed deep unease over the recent developments, fearing they are being excluded from significant diplomatic dialogues that directly affect the geopolitical stability of the region. In response, an emergency meeting of European leaders reflected a collective concern that any agreements reached between the U.S. and Russia could potentially undermine Ukraine's position and European security as a whole <cite>https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/18/rubio-lavrov-ukraine-russiaw/<cite>. While the U.S. officials have reiterated that future negotiations should consider Ukrainian interests, the lack of direct Ukrainian representation in talks thus far raises questions about the sincerity of such assurances and the overall fairness of the mediation process <cite>https://www.brookings.edu/articles/u-s-russia-relations-one-year-after-geneva/<cite>.\n\nIn conclusion, achieving a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Ukraine requires that all parties \u2014 especially Ukraine and its European allies \u2014 are not only included but actively engaged in formulating a peace agreement. The current trajectory of U.S.-Russia relations indicates a move toward potentially excluding key stakeholders like Ukraine, which undermines the prospects for a just and lasting end to the war. As negotiations advance, it is pivotal that the integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine remain central to any dialogue, ensuring that the outcome is not dictated solely by U.S. and Russian interests <cite>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/3274006-russia-usa-diplomatic-talks-a-step-towards-ukraine-peace<cite>."

In recent discussions held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Dmitriev underscored the substantial financial opportunities available to American companies willing to re-enter the Russian market, citing a staggering total loss of over $324 billion that U.S. companies faced after withdrawing in response to the Ukraine invasion. Dmitriev asserted that the sanctions imposed against Russia have adversely impacted the U.S. economy even more than Russia itself, thereby encouraging a reconsideration of the existing economic barriers and fostering mutual cooperation <cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/world/europe/trump-russia-ukraine-putin-trump.html<cite>.\n\nDmitriev characterized the recent U.S.-Russia talks as a pivotal moment in rebuilding relations that have suffered over the years. Throughout the discussions, which included key U.S. figures such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, he expressed a hopeful outlook, stating that the U.S. was beginning to recognize the economic attractiveness of the Russian market and the importance of establishing productive economic contacts. He pointed out that many countries are beginning to understand the necessity of being present in the Russian market, citing a growing interest in positive dialogue and partnership <cite>https://tass.com/economy/1914695<cite>.\n\nAdditionally, Dmitriev emphasized the global importance of improved Russia-U.S. relations, arguing that better cooperation between the two nations is essential for tackling numerous global challenges. He noted that the U.S. side was starting to listen and understand Russia's position more thoroughly than in previous administrations, indicating a potential shift in diplomatic dynamics <cite>https://tass.com/politics/1914659<cite>. Reflecting on the successful conduct of the talks, Dmitriev acknowledged ongoing negotiations regarding settlement in Ukraine, hoping that tangible progress could be made in the next two to three months. He claimed this could lead to significant advancements in economic collaboration, though specific political issues remain outside his purview <cite>https://tass.com/politics/1914785<cite>.\n\nIn summary, Kirill Dmitriev's role as an economic advisor has become crucial in fostering dialogue aimed at revitalizing bilateral relations between the U.S. and Russia.

This meeting, held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, marked the first high-level discussion since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, a period during which U.S.-Russia relations had reached historic lows due to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent military actions in Ukraine <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>.\n\nDuring the talks, both diplomats outlined three primary goals: restoring embassy staffing in Washington and Moscow, establishing a team dedicated to supporting peace talks regarding Ukraine, and exploring closer diplomatic and economic relations <cite>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/19/us-russia-talks-five-takeaways-from-rubio-lavrov-meeting-on-ukraine-war</cite>. This represents a notable reversal from previous U.S. policies under President Joe Biden, which had centered on isolating Russia through sanctions and military support for Ukraine. Analysts suggest this new approach under President Donald Trump could pave the way for future cooperation on global issues, provided a resolution to the conflict can be achieved <cite>https://www.cfr.org/article/toward-settlement-russia-ukraine-war</cite>.\n\nHowever, these developing negotiations are fraught with challenges. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected the notion of any peace deal that excludes Kyiv, emphasizing that Ukraine must be at the forefront of any discussions regarding its future <cite>https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c4g97971rwnt</cite>.

European leaders have voiced their apprehensions regarding the sidelining of Ukraine in negotiations and the broader implications for European security <cite>https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c4g97971rwnt</cite>. Countries such as France have reiterated the need for a strong and unified response to Russia's actions, reinforcing the idea that any peaceful resolution must consider the security guarantees necessary for Ukraine <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>.\n\nThe recent U.S.-Russia meetings indicate a willingness to revisit diplomatic ties. Rubio pointed out that establishing normal diplomatic relations could unlock new opportunities for cooperation beyond the immediate conflict, aiming for an enduring solution that respects Ukraine's territorial integrity <cite>https://www.cfr.org/article/toward-settlement-russia-ukraine-war</cite>. Nevertheless, skepticism remains regarding the genuine intentions of Russia, especially in the context of its ongoing military actions within Ukraine, as evidenced by recent drone strikes that continue to ravage Ukrainian infrastructure <cite>https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/russia-and-us-agree-to-work-toward-ending-ukraine-war-in-a-remarkable-diplomatic-shift/</cite>.

Following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its subsequent military actions in eastern Ukraine, the U.S. imposed a series of sanctions aimed at crippling the Russian economy, fundamentally altering bilateral relations. These sanctions targeted key sectors such as energy, banking, and defense, reflecting a sharp departure from previous engagement strategies and turning trust into suspicion <cite>https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-are-us-russia-relations-so-challenging/</cite>. The ongoing conflict has not only strained these relations but has also encouraged a renewed emphasis on military alliances, particularly through NATO, which has bolstered its presence in Eastern Europe as a countermeasure to perceived Russian aggression <cite>https://russiancouncil.ru/en/analytics-and-comments/columns/military-and-security/u-s-russia-diplomatic-relations-restored-a-game-changer-for-global-stability/</cite>.\n\nRecent shifts in U.S. foreign policy under President Trump are noteworthy, marking a potential recalibration in the path forward. In early 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held pivotal discussions in Riyadh that announced mutual intentions to restore normal diplomatic relations after years of escalating tensions <cite>https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-us-diplomacy-breakdown-f9267ad236ecf4b4568a6d73337c6823</cite>.

International relations have become more multipolar, with Russia looking to strengthen ties with China and other allies, thereby redefining its global standing. The impact of this realignment could have significant consequences for future U.S. foreign policy, reinforcing the need for strategic engagement rather than isolation <cite>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/01/18/russia-ukraine-war-beyond-2025-shuffling-us-russia-relations-and-world-order/</cite>.

    "content": "The long-term effects of sanctions and isolation on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine represent a complex interplay of economic, social, and geopolitical factors. Western sanctions have severely restricted Russia's access to advanced technologies and critical imports, with the U.S. and its allies imposing over 16,500 individual sanctions targeting various sectors, including banking, energy, and technology <cite>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60125659<cite>. These measures have frozen approximately $350 billion of Russia's foreign currency reserves and cut off major Russian banks from the global financial system, including their exclusion from the SWIFT network <cite>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russia-sanctions-are-big-deal-experts-say-effects-take-years-rcna17380<cite>. Consequently, businesses face challenges maintaining operational viability; more than a thousand foreign companies have limited their activities in Russia, leading to shortages in consumer goods and technological products across various sectors <cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/briefing/sanctions-against-russia.html<cite>.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Russia has demonstrated a degree of economic resilience, mainly through its strategic partnerships, particularly with China and other non-Western allies. As the sanctions took effect, reports indicated that trade with China surged, with Russian oil exports to China nearly doubling to account for approximately half of Russia\u2019s crude exports <cite>https://theconversation.com/how-russia-has-managed-to-shake-off-the-impact-of-sanctions-with-a-little-help-from-its-friends-223632<cite>. Russian officials noted that about 90% of Russian oil exports now reach Asia, benefitting from discounted prices and establishing new trade routes that bypass traditional Western channels <cite>https://www.economicsobservatory.com/sanctions-against-russia-what-have-been-the-effects-so-far<cite>. This pivot could shift the global dynamics of energy trade, allowing Russia to continue generating substantial revenue from its fossil fuel exports despite the sanctions, although it risks increasing dependency on China <cite>https://www.csis.org/analysis/strangling-bear-sanctions-russia-after-four-months<cite>.\n\nThe long-term impact of sanctions extends beyond immediate economic measures, reshaping the Russian state\u2019s policies and societal structure. The Kremlin has increasingly militarized its economy, reallocating public funds to defense spending, which accounted for around 40% of the budget by 2024 <cite>https://cnn.com/2024/01/29/europe/russia-sanctions-putin-ukraine-economy-intl/index.html<cite>. Such prioritization has resulted in a distortion of the civilian economy, leading to reduced investments in vital public services like healthcare and education <cite>https://carnegieendowment.org/2024/03/11/why-russia-has-been-so-resilient-to-western-export-controls-pub-91894<cite>. Moreover, the continued isolation has created a public environment of propaganda and control, with state narratives establishing a sense of national resilience against Western aggression. The regime has been able to suppress dissent through strategic repression and the targeting of dissidents, consolidating power within a closed system <cite>https://www.easternherald.com/2023/01/27/sanctions-and-public-opinion-in-russia/<cite>.\n\nIn conclusion, while sanctions have succeeded in inflicting significant immediate economic pains on Russia, the long-term effects include a pivot towards alternative trade partnerships, increased militarization of the economy, and a shift in public perception shaped by state propaganda. The resilience exhibited by the Russian economy, interwoven with its adaptation and strategic sourcing from friendly nations, indicates a complex and evolving response that could sustain its governance structure and international posture despite ongoing isolation <cite>https://www.economicsobservatory.com/sanctions-against-russia-what-have-been-the-effects-so-far<cite>."

Following Ukraine's Maidan Revolution in February 2014, which resulted in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, Russia utilized a mix of covert military operations and political maneuvering to assert control over Crimea. On March 6, 2014, the Crimean Supreme Council, backed by unmarked Russian troops, voted to join Russia, and a hastily organized referendum purportedly showed 96.7% of voters supporting this move, though the legitimacy of this referendum has been hugely disputed as it lacked credible international observation and was conducted under military occupation <cite>https://www.brookings.edu/articles/crimea-six-years-after-illegal-annexation/</cite>.\n\nThe annexation ignited a wave of sanctions from the U.S. and the European Union, targeting key sectors of the Russian economy, particularly finance and energy, asserting that these measures were necessary to uphold international law and deter further Russian aggression <cite>https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-issues-crimea-declaration-reaffirming-rejection-of-russia-s-annexation/29390681.html</cite>. In response, Moscow has maintained that its actions were a restoration of historical justice, citing the ethnic Russian majority in Crimea and alleging that they were responding to the needs of Russian speakers facing discrimination in Ukraine <cite>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/opinion/how-the-crimea-crisis-affects-us-russia-relations.html</cite>.\n\nDespite the ongoing sanctions, Russia has sought to integrate Crimea into its federation, expending significant financial resources to develop infrastructure on the peninsula and bolster its military presence there. The Kremlin's spending has included major projects like the construction of a bridge linking Crimea to mainland Russia, which has cost approximately $3.7 billion <cite>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/21/the-devastating-human-economic-costs-of-crimeas-annexation</cite>. However, the aftermath of the annexation has not been without its challenges; Crimea has experienced significant economic decline due to Western sanctions, with estimates suggesting losses amounting to billions and a notable decrease in trade with Ukraine <cite>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/21/the-devastating-human-economic-costs-of-crimeas-annexation</cite>.\n\nIn recent years, the dynamic between the United States and Russia has continued to evolve against the backdrop of this annexation. The U.S. has reaffirmed its stance on non-recognition of Crimea's annexation even amidst fluctuating diplomatic relations, with significant attention paid to military support for Ukraine, especially during the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine <cite>https://www.brookings.edu/articles/crimea-six-years-after-illegal-annexation/</cite>. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasized this policy in July 2019, reiterating that sanctions would remain until Crimea was returned to Ukraine <cite>https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-issues-crimea-declaration-reaffirming-rejection-of-russia-s-annexation/29390681.html</cite>.

    "content": "The post-Cold War developments in U.S.-Russia relations have been marked by a complex interplay of cooperation and tension, underlined by several significant events and treaties. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the U.S. and Russia entered a phase characterized by a new optimism regarding their diplomatic relationship. In early 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin met with U.S. President George H.W. Bush, where they issued a joint proclamation emphasizing that neither country viewed the other as a potential adversary, and they expressed a commitment to a partnership of cooperation <cite>https://www.russiamatters.org/facts/timeline-us-russia-relations-1983-2023<cite>. This period also saw the signing of the START I treaty in 1991, which aimed to reduce the two nations\u2019 nuclear arsenals, representing a significant step toward nuclear arms control and greater security <cite>https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-russia-nuclear-arms-control<cite>.\n\nHowever, the subsequent years revealed underlying tensions, especially as NATO began its eastward expansion, which Russia perceived as a direct threat to its sphere of influence. The 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia also strained relations, as Russia opposed the intervention on humanitarian grounds and underlined its concerns over NATO's encroachment into Eastern Europe <cite>https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-russia-nuclear-arms-control<cite>. This was compounded by the geopolitical stresses following the 9/11 attacks, where initial cooperation in fighting terrorism did not eliminate deeply rooted mistrust. The signing of the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT) aimed at reducing strategic warheads marked a continuation of nuclear disarmament efforts, although the lack of verification measures raised questions about its effectiveness <cite>https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-russia-nuclear-arms-control<cite>.\n\nThe relationship took a significant downturn during the late 2000s, particularly following the 2008 war in Georgia, where Russia's military intervention was met with severe condemnation from the U.S. and its allies. In response, a more adversarial stance took shape, encapsulated by sanctions and a renewed emphasis on military alliances in Eastern Europe <cite>https://www.russiamatters.org/facts/timeline-us-russia-relations-1983-2023<cite>. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 by Russia further exacerbated tensions, leading to a standoff reminiscent of Cold War hostilities. The U.S. and NATO imposed numerous sanctions targeting key sectors of the Russian economy, while Russia responded by modernizing its military capabilities and engaging in hybrid warfare tactics <cite>https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-russia-nuclear-arms-control<cite>.\n\nThe relationship seems to have entered an even more uncertain phase during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global geopolitical shifts. The Biden administration's approach has focused on reasserting U.S. principles on the world stage while reaffirming commitments to NATO, prompting Russia to respond with aggressive posturing along its borders and cyber incursions <cite>https://www.russiamatters.org/facts/timeline-us-russia-relations-1983-2023<cite>. Furthermore, the recent geopolitical landscape is increasingly characterized by Russia\u2019s alignment with China and its moves to expand influence among non-Western nations, complicating the U.S.-Russia dynamic even further <cite>https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-russia-nuclear-arms-control<cite>. The situation remains precarious, as the specter of a new arms race looms larger, with deteriorating communication channels further straining the ability to manage crises effectively <cite>https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-russia-nuclear-arms-control<cite>."

    "content": "The relationship between the United States and Russia has undergone significant complexities in recent developments, particularly following high-level talks held on February 18, 2025, in Riyadh. These discussions were attended by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who emphasized the necessity of improving bilateral relations to prevent deterioration and facilitate constructive dialogue. Notably, Lavrov stated, \"In order to prevent the torpedoing of the establishment of relations between the Russian Federation and the United States, it is necessary to establish them,\" underlining a collective ambition to enhance cooperation as indicated by conversations between both nations' leaderships <cite>https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/02/18/1065815.html<cite>.\n\nDuring the talks, significant focal points included addressing the protracted conflict in Ukraine and the establishment of direct diplomatic channels. Lavrov expressed gratitude to Saudi Arabian leadership for facilitating the meeting and announced plans to promptly appoint ambassadors to enhance diplomatic engagement. This move is seen as a reflection of efforts to dismantle barriers erected over the past several years, primarily under the Biden administration, which have hampered the efficacy of diplomatic missions <cite>https://news-pravda.com/world/2025/02/19/1069878.html<cite>. Additionally, a key agreement involved initiating a \u201cprocess for Ukrainian settlement,\u201d whereby the U.S. would nominate representatives for these discussions, signaling a willingness from both sides to address the conflict <cite>https://aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/19/us-russia-talks-five-takeaways-from-rubio-lavrov-meeting-on-ukraine-war<cite>.\n\nDespite these hopeful signs, Lavrov articulated the challenges ahead, voicing strong objections to NATO's presence in Ukraine, which Russia views as a direct threat to its sovereignty. The Russian foreign minister reiterated that NATO expansion remains a pivotal issue, stating that any presence of NATO troops in Ukraine would be \"completely unacceptable\" <cite>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/politics/3268643-trumps-bold-diplomacy-bridging-us-russia-tensions-over-ukraine<cite>. This position is compounded by Lavrov\u2019s assertions regarding the implications of U.S. military support for Ukraine and the risks of escalating hostilities, which he characterized as perilous <cite>https://www.newsweek.com/sergey-lavrov-tucker-carlson-hypersonic-missiles-ukraine-1996587<cite>.\n\nThe dialogue in Riyadh marked the first high-level interaction since the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, indicating a significant thaw in diplomatic exchanges after years of strained relations. Lavrov claimed that the discussions were \"highly fruitful,\" and he noted a mutual understanding emerging between the delegations, which he described as crucial for advancing negotiations on bilateral and geopolitical issues <cite>https://www.rt.com/russia/612953-sergey-lavrov-russia-us/<cite>. In this evolving landscape, both nations recognized the necessity to engage constructively to manage their diverging interests without inciting further confrontations <cite>https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/02/19/3260781/russia-us-agree-to-resolve-diplomatic-mission-issues-says-lavrov<cite>. \n\nThe potential for a summit between Presidents Putin and Trump has also been highlighted as a key outcome of these diplomatic efforts, suggesting that both countries are taking steps to lay the groundwork for higher-level discussions that could influence future relations. As Lavrov noted, establishing operational norms for diplomatic missions will be paramount for achieving any sustainable agreements moving forward, and he reiterated that the U.S. and Russia should work together on issues of mutual concern while striving to resolve conflicts amicably <cite>https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/politics/3272491-geopolitical-tensions-and-divergence-the-g20-meeting-in-south-africa-amidst-ukraine-conflict<cite>."
