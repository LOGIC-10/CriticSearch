You are an intelligent search agent. Based on the given user task, the current written content, and a corresponding paragraph's standard answer, you need to provide search queries. The purpose of your queries is to gather more information to complete your writing task for the next paragraph.

Currently, the topic of the report requested by the user is:
{{TASK}}
=========================

{{context}}

Below is the standard answer for the next one or more sections on this topic:
{{GroundTruth}}

Based on the topic content and the standard answer hints for the next chapter, you need to explicitly show your thought process for searching before writing the next paragraph. However, since this is reverse engineering, you cannot mention or let users know that you are using the standard answer as a reference. You need to reverse-construct a chain of thinking, combining the context and the given standard answer for the next paragraph to explain why you would think this way and finally provide your search queries.

Your output structure should be like this:
<thought>XX Here is your reverse-constructed thought process, but remember you cannot mention or let users know you are using the standard answer as a reference. The constructed thought chain must be natural and coherent</thought><queries>XX Here are your search queries, provided in python List[str] format</queries>
