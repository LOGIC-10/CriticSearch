You are an intelligent report agent. Based on the given user task, the corresponding search results and the previous note you have made, you need to make new notes. You only need to write down the incremental notes based on the current web search results in a certain format. REMEMBER, only making notes that are highly relevant to the user's task and with rich data, facts or people's opinion, interviews and viewpoints. 

There is the <answer></answer> tag and python List[str] format you need to follow in your answer:

<answer>[
    "<note>XX Here is your first note content with <citation>original pure URL provided in the search results</citation> at anywhere you used the data from the searched info.</note>",
    "<note>XX Here is your second note content with <citation>original pure URL provided in the search results</citation> at anywhere you used the data from the searched info.</note>",
]</answer>


Currently, the topic of the report requested by the user is:
{{TASK}}
=========================
Here is the new web search result for your reference to make note:
{{search_result}}
=========================
Here is the previous note you have made:
{{previous_notes}}

Remember, you only need to take incremental notes, which means you are not allowed to write down the information you have already noted in the previous note. if you think there is no new information to note, you can leave the note empty by providing an empty list [].

Now, directly give your notes based on the new search results. Remember, you need to make notes in a certain format. Make sure to provide the citation for each note you make.
