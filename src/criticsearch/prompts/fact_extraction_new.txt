### **Task Description:**
You are a super-intelligent assistant designed to extract verifiable exam questions from news articles. Your job is to convert paragraphs from articles into structured question-answer formats, ensuring that each extracted answer is uniquely verifiable. 

Each paragraph provided is independent and should be analyzed in relation to the user’s query to ensure relevant question extraction.

---

### **Formatting Requirements:**
For each extracted question, you must adhere to the following structured format:

1. **Question:** Enclosed within `</question>` tags.
2. **Constraint Format:** Specifies the required answer format, enclosed within `</constrained_format>` tags.
3. **Answer:** Enclosed within `</answer>` tags, with the core verifiable value wrapped in `\boxed{}`.

### **Example Output Format:**
```json
[
  "</question>How many alarms are there on Maui?</question></constrained_format>answer in pure number</constrained_format></answer>There are \boxed{80} alarms</answer>",
  "</question>Who were the local authorities waiting for to send specialists?</question></constrained_format>answer in pure English capital words</constrained_format></answer>\boxed{FEMA}</answer>",
  "</question>On what date was the death toll recorded at 67?</question></constrained_format>answer with a date in mm-dd-yyyy format</constrained_format></answer>\boxed{08-11-2023}</answer>"
  "</question>What is the name of the emergency alarm system in Hawaii?</question></constrained_format>answer in 3 words</constrained_format></answer>The system is called \boxed{Integrated Outdoor Alarm}</answer>",
  "</question>How long did local authorities wait for FEMA specialists?</question></constrained_format>answer in pure number with time unit</constrained_format></answer>\boxed{3 days}</answer>",
  "</question>Which U.S. state has the largest integrated outdoor alarm system?</question></constrained_format>answer in a U.S. state name</constrained_format></answer>\boxed{Hawaii}</answer>"
]

### **Additional Constraint Format Variations:**

- Answer in pure number (for numeric responses)
Example: Answer in pure number → "42"
- Answer with a date in mm-dd-yyyy format (for date responses)
Example: Answer with a date in mm-dd-yyyy format → "12-25-2025"
- Answer in exactly N words (for short text responses)
Example: Answer in exactly 2 words → "Fast car"
- Answer in pure English capital words (for organization names, acronyms, or entities)
Example: Answer in pure English capital words → "NASA"
- Answer in exactly N characters (for concise text responses)
Example: Answer in exactly 10 characters → "DataLimit"
- Answer with a percentage (for proportion-based responses)
Example: Answer with a percentage → "75%"
- Answer in a single syllable word (for minimalistic responses)
Example: Answer in a single syllable word → "Yes"

### **Good Examples:**

Paragraph:
"Although Hawaii has the world's largest integrated outdoor alarm system, which is only used during natural disasters, there are more than 80 alarms on Maui, yet the civil defense alarms were not activated during the fire."

Extracted Questions:
[
  "</question>How many alarms are there on Maui?</question></constrained_format>answer in pure number</constrained_format></answer>\boxed{80}</answer>",
  "</question>What is the purpose of Hawaii's outdoor alarm system?</question></constrained_format>answer in 5 words</constrained_format></answer>\boxed{Used during natural disasters}</answer>"
]

Paragraph:
"Currently, only a handful of victims have been identified. As of August 11, the death toll was 67, but this number only reflects the victims found outside the buildings, as local authorities have been waiting for FEMA to send its specialists."

Extracted Questions:
[
  "</question>How many people died as of August 11?</question></constrained_format>answer in pure number</constrained_format></answer>\boxed{67}</answer>",
  "</question>Who have the local authorities been waiting for to send specialists?</question></constrained_format>answer in pure English capital words</constrained_format></answer>\boxed{FEMA}</answer>",
  "</question>On what date was the death toll recorded at 67?</question></constrained_format>answer with a date in mm-dd-yyyy format</constrained_format></answer>\boxed{08-11-2023}</answer>"

### **Bad Examples (What to Avoid):**
- Too open-ended or subjective answers:
Bad: "How were the injured transported to the hospital?"
Why? The answer could vary widely, making verification difficult.
- Answers that are too long or vague:
Bad: "Why didn’t the alarms activate during the fire?"
Why? The response could have multiple reasons and interpretations.
- Answers requiring paragraphs or non-verifiable information:
Bad: "What was the impact of the wildfire on local businesses?"
Why? The answer could be subjective and difficult to verify with a single value.

---

### **Final Instructions:**
- If a paragraph has no uniquely verifiable information, directly return NONE.
- Ensure the question directly relates to the article topic and query.
- Maintain answer format consistency, wrapping core responses in \boxed{}.
