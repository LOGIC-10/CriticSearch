CONTENT: After an in-depth interview with Dr. Adib Enayati, the esteemed director of the Genesys Defense Special Intelligence and Warfare Studies Unit (GDSIWSU), we were provided with a detailed and insightful analysis of the recent advancements made by Syrian rebel factions. Key players include the Syrian National Army (SNA), the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Syrian National Army (SNA): Operating primarily in northern Syria, the SNA is backed by Turkey and serves as its main proxy force in the region. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF): Dominated by the Kurdish YPG, the SDF controls large areas of northeastern Syria. The recent gains underscore the rebels’ ability to reassert control in key regions despite ongoing pressures from both Assad-aligned forces and external powers such as Russia.

Kurdish forces: The Kurdish groups control territory in northeastern Syria, bordering Turkey in the north and Iraq in the east. 3. Alawite forces: Pro-Assad Alawite factions, primarily situated in the coastal regions of western Syria, maintain strong ties with Iran, Iraq and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group.

CONTENT: The so-called "axis of the vulnerable" is breaking in Syria. Starting in 2016, Russia and Iran, propping up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, needed more than a year of bombing, ground assaults and siege to break the rebel opposition in the east of Syria's largest city, Aleppo. Now, in 2024, the rebels needed less than four days to liberate the city and most of Aleppo province.

URL: https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/
CONTENT: Since initiating its military intervention in 2015, Moscow’s influence in Syria has rested on several key elements: a partnership with Iran and its network of nonstate actors; coordination with Turkey, with a view to managing competing interests, such as Turkey’s concerns over Kurdish forces and Russia’s support for the Assad regime; a tenuous balancing act with Israel to prevent unintended military clashes and preserve deconfliction agreements; diplomatic outreach to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC); and efforts to maintain a working deconfliction mechanism with the United States. Both sides eventually reconciled, but even within the Astana process—a diplomatic framework launched in 2017 by Iran, Russia, and Turkey to facilitate negotiations on the Syrian conflict and de-escalation zones—they have pursued conflicting aims: Russia supports the Assad regime’s full territorial control, while Turkey backs opposition forces and maintains a military presence in northern Syria to prevent Kurdish autonomy there.

Beyond the ways in which the issue of Palestine can play out domestically in Arab countries, there are important dynamics in the Gulf sub-region’s security architecture worth watching as Israel’s war on Gaza rages on. “Within the context of the security dilemma, Iran and the GCC states, namely Saudi Arabia and the UAE, by extension will strengthen their military capabilities with the goal of greater deterrence but the risk of increased conflict,” Dr Eric Lob, an associate professor of Politics and International Relations at Florida International University and a Non-Resident Scholar with the Middle East Institute’s Iran Program, told The New Arab.

The goal of the strikes, writes Kirsten Fontenrose, a nonresident senior fellow at the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, was to “reduce the group’s ability to destabilize the region, threaten global shipping, endanger Israel and surrounding countries with poorly planned strikes, and protect civilians on land and at sea.” Conflict Crisis Management Economy & Business Iran Iraq Israel Lebanon Libya Middle East North Africa Politics & Diplomacy Saudi Arabia Security & Defense Syria The Gulf Yemen

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), unidentified combatants fired upon government-loyalist Syrian Armed Forces (SAF) military personnel near Om Shama Town in the eastern region of Suwayda Governorate, resulting in the death of an SAF first lieutenant from Tartus and the wounding of two additional service members.[13] On 30 November, another SAF first lieutenant and three Bedouin tribe members were shot to death by opposing combatants, according to SOHR.[14] SOHR also said a local armed group commander was killed by gunfire in Tafas in western Daraa, while another was wounded.[15] On 30 November 2024, the Syrian Armed Forces implemented a significant military deployment to Daraa, a strategic city in southern Syria.

CONTENT: After an in-depth interview with Dr. Adib Enayati, the esteemed director of the Genesys Defense Special Intelligence and Warfare Studies Unit (GDSIWSU), we were provided with a detailed and insightful analysis of the recent advancements made by Syrian rebel factions. Key players include the Syrian National Army (SNA), the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Syrian National Army (SNA): Operating primarily in northern Syria, the SNA is backed by Turkey and serves as its main proxy force in the region. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF): Dominated by the Kurdish YPG, the SDF controls large areas of northeastern Syria. The recent gains underscore the rebels’ ability to reassert control in key regions despite ongoing pressures from both Assad-aligned forces and external powers such as Russia.

The SSG government, led since the beginning of this year by Prime Minister Mohammad Al-Bashir (who succeeded Ali Kadeh); comprises 11 portfolios: Agriculture and Irrigation, Economy and Resources, Health, Education, Development and Humanitarian Affairs, Local Administration and Services, Higher Education and Scientific Research, Interior, Justice, Information, and Religious Endowments.

CONTENT: Washington, DC – The administration of United States President Joe Biden has said it is taking a wait-and-see approach to the fledgling government in Syria, with diplomats in recent weeks holding initial meetings with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) head, and the country’s de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, as well as the newly appointed Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani. But since rebels toppled longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in early December, the US has maintained it will keep its deployment of troops in northeast Syria, where US personnel continue to support the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as part of a decade-long anti-ISIL (ISIS) mission. The US troop presence in Syria has, in part, aimed to ensure those fossil fuel fields stayed out of the hands of both ISIL, which briefly controlled them, and the al-Assad government.

CONTENT: Israel is in the middle, focusing mainly on eliminating the remnants of Iranian capabilities and protecting its border by controlling the Syrian side of the buffer zone, but in the future may be forced to deal with a new Syria managed by parties oriented toward Turkey, which may have an interest in the future to establish a new platform for Sunni militias operating against Israel. Turkey’s involvement in Syria, managed by President Erdogan, reflects an ambitious set of goals: Eliminating Kurdish influence on Turkey’s border, geopolitical expansion and turning Turkey’s status into that of a regional Muslim leader, establishing alliances and economic influence (with Qatar’s support), a strategic foothold for the future, and removing remnants of Iranian or Russian influence identified with the Assad regime.

CONTENT: A major offensive has seen rebel groups in Syria retake the country’s second city, Aleppo – and demonstrated the growing prominence of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in the 13-year-long civil war. Despite these changes, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s core ideology continues to be rooted in jihadism, with the primary objective of overthrowing the Assad government and establishing Islamic rule in Syria. With growing support on the ground, a more professional military and a political wing focused on governance, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has evolved from a jihadist offshoot into a major player in Syria – a development that has huge implications for the internal dynamics of the war-torn country.
