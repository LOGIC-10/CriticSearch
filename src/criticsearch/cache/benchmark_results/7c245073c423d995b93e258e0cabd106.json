The deaths of Hassan Nasrallah and much of its military leadership, combined with the redeployment of Hezbollah fighters in Syria back to Lebanon, left a large power vacuum. With the Russian military concentrating on its Russian invasion of Ukraine|invasion of Ukraine and Iran under significant pressure, it provided an opportunity for rebel groups to launch an offensive. According to Nick Heras, an analyst with the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, the rebels were trying to pre-empt a Syrian government offensive which was being shaped by Russian and Syrian airstrikes on rebel areas. The presence of Turkish-backed groups in the offensive was believed to be a warning from Turkey to Russia and the Syrian government to avoid any offensives in the region. Prior to the fall of the Assad government, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed that if this were to occur, it would damage the global perception of Russia as an effective partner and protector which together with the loss of bases in Syria which are the primary logistical hubs for shipments from Russia sent to Libya and eventually sub-Saharan Africa would undermine Russia's goals of expanding its influence in Africa. Tartus naval base|Tartus base is Russia's only formal overseas naval base and links Russia's Black Sea assets to the Mediterranean and is central for future expansion plans in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, which would threaten NATO's southern flank. The ISW analysed that the Africa Corps (Russia)|Africa Corps, while the easiest to deploy to Syria, lacks the numbers to make a difference and its limited forces are already overstretched across Africa or recalled to fight in Kursk to repel the 2024 Kursk offensive|Ukrainian incursion into Russia. Russian analysts generally blamed al-Assad for losing the war. Speaking to ''Komsomolskaya Pravda'', Semyon Bagdasarov argued that the Syrian government failed to motivate its troops and to unite the various Syrian ethnic and religious groups around its cause. Similarly, political scientist Andrey Kortunov wrote that al-Assad had failed to unite Syrians and achieve national reconciliation, comparing him to former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, who Fall of Kabul (2021)|was overthrown by the Taliban in 2021. Journalist Vitaly Ryumshin shared this comparison, but partially defended the Syrian government, arguing that the lack of reform was due to economic sanctions on the country and loss of control over the oil's resources to the United States and the Kurds. In a different view, Anton Mardasov, a Russian expert on the Middle East, told ''Nezavisimaya Gazeta'' that the government's collapse was not due to Western sanctions but because of al-Assad's failure in dealing with the country's problems, specifically mentioning the economic crisis, endemic corruption and nepotism and \"the loss of touch with reality and thinking in the paradigm of 50 years ago\". According to ''The Sunday Telegraph'', the collapse of the Assad regime carries repercussions for both Russia and Iran due to their investment on the survival of the regime; Iran's Axis of Resistance had effectively collapsed with the loss of Assad's rule in Syria, undermining Iran's ability to supply Hezbollah, while Russia's invasion of Ukraine distracted Putin from Syria and exposed his struggle to keep supporting Russia's allies in Latin America and Africa (in particular Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger).\n## Background\nSince the March 2020 Idlib ceasefire agreement, large scale operations ceased between opposition and pro-government forces in Northwestern Syria. However, revolutionary groups based in northwestern Syria prepared for a resumption of hostilities, with HTS in particular strengthening its military capabilities by reforming its structures into a \"conventional armed force\", improving training, and setting up special forces specializing in raids and night-time operations. Meanwhile, the Syrian government suffered from Corruption in Syria|growing corruption, with researcher Charles Lister describing it as the \"world's biggest narco state\" whose \"corrupt business elite and a powerful network of military commanders, militia leaders and warlords\" were held together by drug trade revenue, especially Syrian Captagon industry|trade of Captagon.  Aleppo had been controlled by Bashar al-Assad's government and Iranian-backed militias since the Aleppo offensive (November–December 2016)|Aleppo offensive in 2016. According to Abu Hassan al-Hamwi, head of HTS's military wing, the offensive had been planned for a year prior to its launch. Beginning in 2019, HTS developed a military doctrine aimed at transforming loosely organized opposition and jihadist fighters into a conventional military force. The group established specialized military branches, most notably a drone unit that produced reconnaissance, attack, and suicide drones. HTS additionally established coordination with southern Syrian rebels, creating a unified command structure that incorporated leaders from approximately 25 rebel groups, with the strategic objective of encircling Damascus from multiple directions. HTS initiated the offensive partly to disrupt regional powers' diplomatic normalization with the Assad regime and to counter escalating aerial attacks on northwestern Syria. The group determined that Assad's international allies were strategically constrained, with Russia committed to its war in Ukraine and both Iran and Hezbollah engaged in conflict with Israel, presenting a favorable tactical opportunity.\n## Offensive\nOn 27 November 2024, HTS announced that it had launched an offensive dubbed \"Deterrence of Aggression\" toward pro-government forces in western Aleppo Governorate. The offensive was a response to recent artillery shelling by the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad against rebel-held Idlib, which killed at least 30 civilians.\n## Preface\nOn 27 November 2024, a coalition of Syrian opposition to Bashar al-Assad|Syrian revolutionary factions called the Military Operations Command (Syria)|Military Operations Command led by Tahrir al-Sham|Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and supported by allied Turkey|Turkish-backed groups in the Syrian National Army (SNA) launched an offensive against the Ba'athist Syria|Ba'athist regime's armed forces in Idlib Governorate|Idlib, Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo and Hama Governorates in Syria. The operation was codenamed '''Deterrence of Aggression'''{{refn|group=note|{{langx|ar|ردع العدوان|translit=Rade Aleudwan}}}} by HTS. This is the first time that opposition forces in the Syrian civil war launched a military offensive campaign since the Northwestern Syria offensive (December 2019 – March 2020)#Second Russia–Turkey ceasefire|March 2020 Idlib ceasefire. On 7 December 2024, Southern Operations Room forces entered the Rif Dimashq Governorate from the south, and came within 10 kilometers of the capital Damascus. SFA forces moved towards the capital from the south east.{{bsn|date=December 2024}} By 8 December, they had captured Homs, which effectively cut Assad's forces from Syria's coast.

As the HTS forces started closing in on Hama, pro-government forces established new military positions on the outskirts of the city, including reinforcements to Jabal Zayn al-Abidin and the towns of Taybat al Imam, Qamhana, and Khitab. Additionally, Russia launched airstrikes on towns recently captured by rebels in the Idlib and Hama regions. This includes one targeting a refugee camp in Idlib city that killed nine civilians and injured 62 others, and another 2024 Aleppo University Hospital airstrike|airstrike targeting Aleppo university hospital killed eight civilians.
