CONTENT: After an in-depth interview with Dr. Adib Enayati, the esteemed director of the Genesys Defense Special Intelligence and Warfare Studies Unit (GDSIWSU), we were provided with a detailed and insightful analysis of the recent advancements made by Syrian rebel factions. Key players include the Syrian National Army (SNA), the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Syrian National Army (SNA): Operating primarily in northern Syria, the SNA is backed by Turkey and serves as its main proxy force in the region. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF): Dominated by the Kurdish YPG, the SDF controls large areas of northeastern Syria. The recent gains underscore the rebels’ ability to reassert control in key regions despite ongoing pressures from both Assad-aligned forces and external powers such as Russia.

Together, these interconnected challenges demand a nuanced and strategic approach from U.S. policy in a post-Assad Syria. In determining its policies for a post-Assad Syria, the U.S. must reconsider the Caesar Act and other sanctions. As Syria navigates a post-conflict phase, U.S. policy should adapt by pairing adjusted sanctions with proactive diplomatic initiatives aimed at facilitating reconstruction, refugee return, and broader international engagement to foster stability.

CONTENT: After Assad: Turkey's Rise and Iran's Decline in Syria - JURIST - Commentary - Legal News & Commentary After Assad: Turkey’s Rise and Iran’s Decline in Syria The author, an independent Middle East analyst, argues that the sudden fall of Assad's regime in late 2024 has fundamentally reshaped Syria's political landscape, creating a dangerous power vacuum... The fall of the Assad regime is more than the collapse of one leader, but an event which dislocates the state’s centralized authority and could turn Syria into a failed state. The fall of Assad has fundamentally weakened Iran’s leading role in Syria under his rule. The fall of Assad’s regime dealt a significant blow to Iran’s so-called “axis of resistance,” a network of allies and proxies intended to oppose Israeli and Western influence in the Middle East.

[+] Ankara’s approach to Kurdish dynamics may define its role in the emerging order. Turkey's approach to Syria, historically filtered through the lens of curtailing Kurdish influence along its borders, has shaped its strategic positioning. Does Turkey accommodate HTS’s rise, acknowledge Kurdish realities, and carve out a constructive role that secures both influence and stability? Moving swiftly—accepting HTS’s ascendancy, negotiating pragmatic terms with Kurdish elements—might signal adaptability and secure Turkey’s seat at the table.

CONTENT: In the first phase (2011-2016), Turkey was an active supporter of the uprising in Syria and its primary goal was the overthrow of the Assad regime. Among the various armed groups, HTS currently holds the upper hand, and the relationship between HTS and Turkey is likely to play a pivotal role in shaping Syria’s future, as well as Turkey’s influence in the region. Turkey’s support for HTS has ensured the latter’s survival and facilitated its transformation into a quasi-state actor, solidifying Ankara’s influence in Syria’s future. However, Turkey’s relations with other armed groups, particularly the SNA and SDF, could complicate Syria’s transition in the post-Assad era.

CONTENT: Through close analysis of micro-data on company formation in Syria and publicly available government statements and news articles compiled by the Observatory of Political and Economic Networks (OPEN),1 it is now clear that Assad is engineering changes in the informal economic networks that have long underpinned the country’s political economy. In shoring up the economic bases of Assad’s power, these networks, among other factors, help to explain how, despite Syria’s spiraling economic crisis and the impact of sanctions, the regime is able to sustain a rejectionist, give-no-quarter approach, whether in talks around the terms of normalization with neighbors or in relation to the concessions associated with a political settlement of the Syrian conflict along lines envisioned in U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254.

Assad's downfall puts the future of Russia's military bases there in play and HTS has explicitly stated that it wants Syria to stop being a “playground for Iranian ambitions.” As to why they didn't get involved, a lot of it comes down to both Russia and Iran being tied down by the war in Ukraine and war in the broader Middle East.

TITLE: The Coming Conflict with Hezbollah - CSIS
URL: https://www.csis.org/analysis/coming-conflict-hezbollah
CONTENT: Western analysts praised Hezbollah’s efficacy in the 2006 war with Israel, and its forces have only since grown more effective.[58] Hezbollah’s combat experience in Syria has given its troops experience in ground combat that few regional militaries possess, forcing them to learn how to conduct offensive operations and exposing them to the tactics, techniques, and procedures of the Russian military.[59] Hezbollah members have also repeatedly displayed a willingness to accept decisive engagement and fight to the last soldier—attitudes that will only be increased by the desire to defend their homes from an Israeli offensive.[60]
In short, the Hezbollah that Israel would face if violence were to escalate to major ground operations is more capable than in 2006. During the war in Iraq, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps–Quds Force—which aids Hezbollah—built infrared triggers, explosive circuits, and other EFP components in Iran and smuggled them across the border in Iraq to be used against U.S. forces.[48] Hezbollah could also conduct attacks on Israeli forces using tunnel bombs, which were used in Iraq and Syria to literally undermine fortified positions, or improvised rocket-assisted munitions, which Hezbollah used.[49] These IED capabilities, combined with Hezbollah’s ATGMs, would allow the group to harass and disrupt the advance of Israeli ground forces in Lebanon.

 First, the security situation has dramatically worsened in recent months for several reasons: the October 7 attacks profoundly increased Israeli insecurity; the displacement of over 150,000 civilians on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border has created growing pressure, particularly in Israel, to alter the security situation so that civilians can return; Hezbollah and Iranian-linked groups in Lebanon and Syria continue to stockpile stand-off weapons that can hit Israel; and Hezbollah continues to violate UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701. In the wake of the 2006 war, Hezbollah continued to build on the strengths of this approach, decentralizing its command and control and reorganizing to force the IDF into more urbanized terrain where its fighters can take advantage of concealed, fortified positions.[23]
Hezbollah’s experience fighting in support of Bashar al-Assad in Syria for the past decade has given it access to capabilities and competencies used by conventional armies.

The fall of the Assad regime is more than the collapse of one leader, but an event which dislocates the state’s centralized authority and could turn Syria into a failed state. The fall of Assad has fundamentally weakened Iran’s leading role in Syria under his rule. The fall of Assad’s regime dealt a significant blow to Iran’s so-called “axis of resistance,” a network of allies and proxies intended to oppose Israeli and Western influence in the Middle East.

CONTENT: Unlike the US – which shifted its focus to fighting radical Islamist groups – and Arab states increasingly preoccupied with their own regime security, Turkey maintained its anti-Assad policies and sustained support to the rebel groups including the SNA, its main proxy force. The Astana peace process initiated in 2017 between Russia, Turkey and Iran established four de-escalation zones across Syria including the Idlib province bordering Turkey, where Ankara secured military observation points. Some reports suggest that Turkey was informed of the presence of an attack plan by HTS six months ago, but Ankara did not endorse it, fearing that such a move would re-escalate the war between the regime and rebel groups and lead to a growing refugee flow from Syria.

TITLE: The Future of Hezbollah after the Ceasefire in Lebanon
URL: https://rasanah-iiis.org/english/monitoring-and-translation/reports/the-future-of-hezbollah-after-the-ceasefire-in-lebanon/
CONTENT: The Future of Hezbollah after the Ceasefire in Lebanon | International Institute for Iranian Studies After 13 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, the agreement requires Hezbollah to withdraw from southern Lebanon and tasks the LAF with dismantling all non-state military infrastructure, preventing Hezbollah’s rearmament, and assuming primary responsibility for security in the region. The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah includes an initial two-month ceasefire, during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon, and Hezbollah would cease its armed presence in the southern border region south of the Litani River. Prolonged economic hardship in Lebanon, combined with growing domestic discontent and international pressure, could weaken Hezbollah’s influence over time, forcing it to recalibrate its role in Lebanese and regional politics.

TITLE: Russian Military Objectives and Capacity in Ukraine Through 2024
URL: https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russian-military-objectives-and-capacity-ukraine-through-2024
CONTENT: In terms of Russian industry's capacity to support ongoing operations, Russia has significantly mobilised its defence industry, increasing shifts and expanding production lines at existing facilities as well as bringing previously mothballed plants back online. However, if Ukraine's partners continue to provide sufficient ammunition and training support to the AFU to enable the blunting of Russian attacks in 2024, then Russia is unlikely to achieve significant gains in 2025. Adopting an approach that aims to ensure Ukraine's resistance through 2025 not only undermines the Kremlin's theory of victory but also provides sufficient time to establish a rational mobilisation and training process for the AFU such that it can begin to qualitatively outmatch Russian forces, even if the latter continue to increase in overall size.

CONTENT: Russia came into the war believing “the Ukrainian government would retreat or be betrayed by its own population, that resistance would swiftly collapse, and that Russian troops would be welcomed as liberators.” In both Chechnya (1994) and Ukraine, Russian political leadership failed to understand their adversary or appreciate their own limitations. A US-led strategy that focuses on military and economic aid to Ukraine denying Russia export revenue, unflinchingly enforcing technological embargos, and reaching out to the Russian population to change their view of the war and encourage emigration needs to be formulated, issued, and vigorously implemented.
