The prerequisite for a model to discover new knowledge is its ability to integrate existing human knowledge. Therefore, it is crucial for the agent to have the ability to gather information from the internet. Currently, we have the capability to search for simple facts (such as who was the President of the United States in July 2023), and we hope that the model can further acquire the ability to conduct in-depth explorations on websites. You are an expert in designing benchmarks in this area, and there are some requirements for designing such data:  
1. The information is hidden deep in the internet (it cannot be simply found by searching a keyword directly on Google).
2. The conditions are coupled and unclear; one must conduct detailed reasoning and trial-and-error to uncover the key pathways.  

First, you need to design a seed fact for the given {{domain}} domain, and the requirements for the seed fact are as follows:  
1. It should be easy to verify and there should only be one answer, for example, the President of the United States on July 24, 2023, is Biden.
2. The seed fact must be relatively difficult; it should not be something that can be randomly found instantly but rather something that you discover hidden deeper within search results on the internet.  

The seed fact must be difficult: you cannot simply search for the seed fact on Google and find the answer. For example, searching "Who was the President of the United States on July 24, 2023," immediately yields Biden, indicating that the seed fact is too simple. You can first construct various queries you are interested in within your domain and search online, finding a deep webpage with highly specialized information, from which you can select to construct a difficult question and its corresponding unique short answer. For example:  

Suppose you access this webpage:  
https://www.3dmgame.com/g!/3898261.html:  
The factual paragraph on the webpage states: "The 'Colossal Crusher' is a massive weapon in the game 'Elden Ring,' which is set to have been widely used during the 'War of the Giants.' This weapon is one of the heaviest in the land between, symbolizing the immense power of that era. With the extinction of the giants and the rise of wars among humans, this weapon gradually fell into obscurity and exited the combat stage. Compared to ancient times, humanity has become increasingly fragile and can no longer wield such a heavy weapon."  

Therefore, you can extract a question and corresponding ground truth short answer: "In which war was the Colossal Crusher widely used?"  
Of course, you need to output in the standardized JSON format:  
{
  "seed": {
    "question": "粉碎巨人锤在什么战争中被广泛使用",
    "answer": "巨人战争",
    "evidence": [
      {
        "url": "https://www.3dmgame.com/g!/3898261.html",
        "text": "粉碎巨人锤是《艾尔登法环》游戏中的一把特大武器，其背景设定为在“巨人战争”中被广泛使用的巨岩大槌。该武器是交界地中最为沉重的武器之一，象征着那个时代的强大力量。随着巨人的灭亡和人与人之间战争的兴起，这把武器逐渐被遗忘，退出了战斗的舞台。与远古时代相比，人类变得越来越脆弱，无法再驾驭如此沉重的武器。"
      },
      {...},
    ]
  },
}  

Now, to design a seed fact in the {{domain}} domain, you need to browse through the content of the webpages you searched to generate a data in the format above.  

Here are the search results:  
========= Search Results =========  
{{search_results}}  
========= End of Search Results =========  

Please output strictly according to the aforementioned JSON format:
