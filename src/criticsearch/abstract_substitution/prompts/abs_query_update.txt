You are an expert in upgrading the difficulty level of a question, and you need to upgrade a specific part of a given question. You must select an upgrade method and provide the corresponding search query to ensure your upgrade is valid. You will be required to follow a specific format for your output.

# There are several upgrade methods as follows:

## METHOD 1: equivalence substitution

### Case 1

Assume there is a question: "Who was the president of the United States on July 24, 2023?" The answer is Biden. In the question, the date "July 24, 2023" should be searched online for what happened on that date. For example, you might find "On the day of the collective boycott by opposition lawmakers and public protests, the ruling coalition in the Israeli parliament passed the judicial reform proposal by a vote of 64 to 0."

i. Find the basis: Verify that this reverse upgrade is supported and provide a specific URL:  
https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-netanyahu-discharged-hospital-reuters-witness-says-2023-07-24/ which clearly states the incident occurred on July 24, 2023.  
ii. Confirm uniqueness: Ensure that after this reverse upgrade, the answer remains unique. You need to confirm through online sources that "On the day of the collective boycott by opposition lawmakers and public protests, the ruling coalition in the Israeli parliament passed the judicial reform proposal by a vote of 64 to 0" occurred specifically at U.S. time on July 24, 2023, and not at any other time or the time of the report's release; it should be a very unique event date. (If the time is not unique, it represents that this is not an equivalent substitution.)

You must ensure that the answer does not appear in your upgraded question. Then you can use the equivalence substitution method to upgrade the question: On the day when the ruling coalition in the Israeli parliament passed the judicial reform proposal by a vote of 64 to 0 in the face of a collective boycott by opposition lawmakers and public protests, who was the sitting president of the United States?

So the output you need to provide is:  
<answer>
<data>
{
    "original_question": "Who was the President of the United States on July 24, 2023?",
    "updated_question": "On the day the ruling coalition in the Israeli Parliament passed the judicial reform plan by a vote of 64 to 0 amidst a collective boycott by opposition lawmakers and public protests, who was the sitting President of the United States?",
    "updated_evidence": [
        {
            "url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-netanyahu-discharged-hospital-reuters-witness-says-2023-07-24/",
            "fact": "The ruling coalition in the Israeli Parliament passed the judicial reform plan by a vote of 64 to 0 amidst a collective boycott by opposition lawmakers and public protests."
        },
    ]
}
</data>
</answer>

### Case 2

Assume there is a question: "In which war was the Colossal Giant Crusher widely used?" The answer is "Giant War."

In the question, the weapon "Colossal Giant Crusher" should be researched online for its background. For example, you might find that "The Colossal Giant Crusher is a massive weapon from the game 'Elden Ring,' set against the backdrop of being widely used in the 'Giant War.' This weapon is one of the heaviest in the Lands Between, symbolizing the tremendous power of that era. With the downfall of the giants and the rise of conflict among humans, this weapon gradually faded into obscurity and exited the battlefield. Compared to ancient times, humans have become increasingly fragile and can no longer wield such a heavy weapon."

You can replace "Colossal Giant Crusher" with "a massive weapon from the game 'Elden Ring,' a colossal rock hammer. This weapon is one of the heaviest in the Lands Between, symbolizing the great power of that era. With the downfall of the giants and the rise of conflict among humans, this weapon gradually faded into obscurity and exited the battlefield," but you also need to ensure that the answer "Giant War" does not appear in your upgraded question. You can then use the equivalence substitution method to upgrade the question: "In what war was such a weapon, a massive weapon from the game 'Elden Ring,' used widely, which is one of the heaviest in the Lands Between, symbolizing the great power of that era, gradually faded into obscurity and exited the battlefield?"

So the output you need to provide is:  
<answer>
<data>
{
    "original_question": "In which war was the Colossal Giant Crusher widely used?",
    "updated_question": "In what war was such a weapon, a massive weapon from the game 'Elden Ring,' used widely, which is one of the heaviest in the Lands Between, symbolizing the great power of that era, gradually faded into obscurity and exited the battlefield?",
    "updated_evidence": [
        {
            "url": "https://www.3dmgame.com/g!/3898261.html",
            "fact": "The Colossal Giant Crusher is a massive weapon from the game 'Elden Ring,' set against the backdrop of being widely used in the 'Giant War.' This weapon is one of the heaviest in the Lands Between, symbolizing the tremendous power of that era."
        },
    ]
}

The above are examples of equivalence substitution.

## METHOD 2: Complex abstraction concretization

If you abstract a certain entity into something with numerous possibilities or a very open range, you need to provide additional information. The additional information you provide can be listed as points, such as for the entity "Berya," if you replace it directly with "a game character," the possibilities are too many, so you would add information, turning it into "a female game character, with 1) a fierce expression, 2) pink-white hair." Or for "Einstein," if you directly replace it with "a scientist," the possibilities are too many, so you would add information, turning it into "a scientist, who 1) is a physicist, 2) won the Nobel Prize in XXXX year," and 3) was born in 1879.


Suppose you're now facing a question: What is the title of Detective Conan TV series episode 439?

Answer: そして誰もいなくなればいい

So the output you need to provide is:  
<answer>  
<data>
{
    "original_question": "What is the title of episode 439 of the Conan TV series?",
    "updated_question": "There is a TV series, what is the name of its episode 439? This TV series premiered 117 years after the birth of a scientist who 1) is a physicist, 2) won the Nobel Prize in XXXX year, and his first wife was born in Titel, Austro-Hungary.",
    "updated_evidence": [
        {
            "url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-Einstein",
            "fact": "Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect."
        },
        {
            "url": "https://www.biography.com/history-culture/mileva-einstein-maric",
            "fact": "His first wife Mileva Marić was born on December 19, 1875, in Titel, which was then part of Austro-Hungary (now in Serbia)."
        },
    ]
}
</data>
