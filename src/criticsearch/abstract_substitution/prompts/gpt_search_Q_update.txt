You are an expert at increasing the difficulty of questions, and today you need to enhance a certain part of a given question. You must choose a method of enhancement and provide the corresponding search query to ensure your enhancement is effective. You need to output the result in a specific format.

# Enhancement methods are as follows:

## Method One: Equivalent Substitution

### Example One

Suppose there is a question: "Who was the President of the United States on July 24, 2023?" The answer is Biden. In the question, the date "July 24, 2023" requires you to search online for events that occurred on that day. For example, you might find information like: "On the day of the collective boycott by opposition lawmakers and public protests, the ruling coalition in the Israeli Parliament passed the judicial reform proposal by a vote of 64 to 0." Or any other specific unique event that happened on that date; temporal event substitution is a common way to construct complex questions.

i. Evidence search: Verify whether this reverse enhancement is effective and provide a specific URL:  
https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-netanyahu-discharged-hospital-reuters-witness-says-2023-07-24/ This link clearly states that the event occurred on July 24, 2023.  
ii. Confirm uniqueness: Ensure that the date of the event after this reverse enhancement is unique on July 24, 2023, in U.S. time, and that it is not for another time or the time the report was published; it should be a highly unique event date. (If the time is not unique, then this is not a valid equivalent substitution.)

You must ensure that the answer does not appear in your enhanced question. Then you can use the equivalent substitution method to enhance the question: On the day the ruling coalition in the Israeli Parliament passed the judicial reform proposal by a vote of 64 to 0 amidst a collective boycott by opposition lawmakers and public protests, who was the President of the United States?

Then the output you need to provide is:  
<answer>  
<data>  
{  
    "original_question": "Who was the President of the United States on July 24, 2023?",  
    "updated_question": "On the day the ruling coalition in the Israeli Parliament passed the judicial reform plan by a vote of 64 to 0 amidst a collective boycott by opposition lawmakers and public protests, who was the sitting President of the United States?",  
    "updated_evidence": [  # Place all the evidence you used to update the question here
        {  
            "url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-netanyahu-discharged-hospital-reuters-witness-says-2023-07-24/",  
            "fact": "The ruling coalition in the Israeli Parliament passed the judicial reform plan by a vote of 64 to 0 amidst a collective boycott by opposition lawmakers and public protests."  
        },  
    ],
    "method": "equivalence substitution"
}  
</data>  
</answer>

### Example Two

Suppose there is a question: "In what war was the Colossal Giant Crusher widely used?" The answer is "Giant War."

In the question, the weapon "Colossal Giant Crusher" needs background research online. For example, you might find: "The Colossal Giant Crusher is a massive weapon from the game 'Elden Ring,' and its background is that it was widely used in the 'Giant War.' This weapon is one of the heaviest in the Lands Between, symbolizing the tremendous power of that era. As the giants declined and human conflicts intensified, this weapon gradually faded from history, as ancient humans became increasingly weak and unable to wield such heavy weapons."

You can replace "Colossal Giant Crusher" with "a massive weapon from the game 'Elden Ring,' a huge rock hammer. It is one of the heaviest weapons in the Lands Between, symbolizing the immense power of that era. As the giants declined and conflicts among humans escalated, this weapon gradually faded from the historical stage." However, you still need to ensure that the answer "Giant War" no longer appears in the enhanced question. Then you can use the equivalent substitution method to enhance the question: "In what war was such a weapon, a massive weapon from the game 'Elden Ring,' widely used, which is one of the heaviest in the Lands Between, symbolizing the great power of that era, gradually faded into obscurity and exited the battlefield?"

Then you need to search online for relevant information and based on the search results, the output you need to provide is:  
<answer>  
<data>  
{  
    "original_question": "In which war was the Colossal Giant Crusher widely used?",  
    "updated_question": "In what war was such a weapon, a massive weapon from the game 'Elden Ring,' used widely, which is one of the heaviest in the Lands Between, symbolizing the great power of that era, gradually faded into obscurity and exited the battlefield?",  
    "updated_evidence": [  
        {  
            "url": "https://www.3dmgame.com/g!/3898261.html",  
            "fact": "The Colossal Giant Crusher is a massive weapon from the game 'Elden Ring,' set against the backdrop of being widely used in the 'Giant War.' This weapon is one of the heaviest in the Lands Between, symbolizing the tremendous power of that era."  
        },  
    ],
    "method": "equivalence substitution"
}  
</data>  
</answer>

Above are examples of the equivalent substitution method.

## Method Two: Complex Abstraction and Visualization

If you abstract a certain entity into having many possibilities or a very open range, you need to provide additional information. The extra information you provide can be found online and listed in bullet points. For example, for the entity "Berya," if you directly replace it with "game character," there might be too many possibilities, so you need to add information you found online, turning it into "a female game character, 1) with a fierce expression, 2) pink-white hair." Or for "Einstein," if you directly replace it with "a scientist," there might be too many possibilities, so you need to add some obscure information you found online, transforming it into "a physicist, 1) who won the Nobel Prize, 2) born in 1879."

Suppose you are now faced with the question: "What is the title of episode 439 of the Detective Conan series?"

The answer is: そして誰もいなくなればいい

Then the output you need to provide is:  
<answer>  
<data>  
{  
    "original_question": "What is the title of episode 439 of the Conan TV series?",  
    "updated_question": "There is a TV series, what is the name of its episode 439? This TV series premiered 117 years after the birth of a scientist who 1) is a physicist, 2) won the Nobel Prize in XXXX year, and his first wife was born in Titel, Austro-Hungary.",  
    "updated_evidence": [  
        {  
            "url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-Einstein",  
            "fact": "Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect."  
        },  
        {  
            "url": "https://www.biography.com/history-culture/mileva-einstein-maric",  
            "fact": "His first wife Mileva Marić was born on December 19, 1875, in Titel, which was then part of Austro-Hungary (now in Serbia)."  
        },  
    ],
    "method": "complex abstraction concretization"  
}  
</data>  
</answer>  

Now, you need to face the question: {{question}}, and the answer is {{answer}}. You need to use one of the method according to actual circumstances to enhance this question. Remember to provide the relevant search results to assist in your enhancement. Please follow the format described above for the output.
