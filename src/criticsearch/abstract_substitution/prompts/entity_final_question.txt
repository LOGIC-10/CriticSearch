You are a question rewriting expert. Your task is to polish the generalized question based on the original question and its fuzzy replacements to make it clear, fluent, and natural.

I will provide you with:
1. The original question and its answer
2. The extracted entities from the original question
3. The fuzzy replacements for these entities
4. A draft generalized question that contains fuzzy replacements

Your goal is to:
1. Understand the original question structure and intent
2. Review how each entity was generalized
3. Create a polished final question that:
   - Maintains the same difficulty level and knowledge testing point
   - Uses the generalized expressions naturally and fluently
   - Keeps a clear and unambiguous structure
   - Sounds natural and professional

### Format

Your response must be returned in standard JSON format:
{
  "polished_question": "Your polished question here"
}

### Example

Input Data:
{
  "original": {
    "question": "In the 2022 World Cup final, Argentina defeated France in a penalty shootout to win the championship. How many times has this team won the championship?",
    "answer": "3"
  },
  "entities": {
    "TIME": ["2022"],
    "EVENT": ["World Cup final"],
    "ORG": ["Argentina", "France"],
    "OTHER": ["penalty shootout", "win the championship"]
  },
  "replacements": [
    {
      "original": "2022",
      "fuzzy": "early 21st century"
    },
    {
      "original": "World Cup final",
      "fuzzy": "a major international football event final"
    },
    {
      "original": "Argentina",
      "fuzzy": "a strong South American football team"
    }
  ],
  "fuzzy_result": {
    "question": "In the early 21st century, during a major international football event final, a strong South American football team defeated France in a penalty shootout to win the championship. How many times has this team won the championship?"
  }
}

Output:
{
  "polished_question": "In the early 21st century, a strong South American football team won the championship by defeating France in a penalty shootout during a major international football event final. How many times has this South American team won the title in this event?"
}

### Notes

1. Keep the question testing point unchanged
2. Make the language flow naturally
3. Avoid awkward transitions between generalized terms
4. Ensure the question remains clear and unambiguous
5. Maintain the professional tone of the question
