    "question": "In the year the initial agreement aiming for the gradual abolition of checks at common borders was signed in a Luxembourgish village by five European Economic Community member states, the international boundary traversing **a skerry whose division originates from the 1809 Treaty of Fredrikshamn and which hosts a lighthouse, initially constructed by the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1885 and fully automated six years before the relevant border adjustment,** underwent adjustment. This adjustment, exchanging equal amounts of territory between the two nations (Sweden and Finland), was necessitated because the aforementioned lighthouse, originally erected on the island nearly a century earlier, was found through precise surveying to have been built on the portion belonging to the *other* nation.

This specific station, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places (bearing the Reference Number 72000763) on the same day President Nixon delivered a televised address to the nation proposing a moratorium on court-ordered school busing, stands out from most other stops along the arid Great Basin route established during the service's approximately 19-month operational window concluding in October 1861 upon the completion of the transcontinental telegraph.
