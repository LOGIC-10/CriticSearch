For example at 22 and 23 blocks high, the same damage value of 19 is generated. However at 24 blocks high, 21 hearts [damage points/half-hearts] of damage is generated... Therefore it can be confirmed 23 blocks is the largest amount of blocks high, one with only armour/no armour/ blocking can survive from."

Smalt is known for its tendency to lose its color over time, especially when used in oil medium... The discoloration is caused by the leaching of potassium ions from the glass matrix... Cobalt as a component of smalt also acts as a siccative... Notable painters who employed smalt include Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Velázquez, Murillo, Rubens, Jordaens, Brueghel, Claude Lorrain and Poussin."

        "fact": "Perhaps the most exciting pigment discovery from the Coffin Project’s analysis was the identification of huntite (Mg3Ca(CO3)4), a very rare magnesium calcium carbonate mineral. Although huntite was first identified by the British Museum as a white pigment on pottery from Naucratis in the 1960s, its use was thought to be anomalous; however, the Coffin Project’s analysis identified huntite on five coffins from the 21st and 22nd Dynasties (c. 1000–800 BC), suggesting that its use was perhaps more widespread during the Third Intermediate Period than previously thought."
