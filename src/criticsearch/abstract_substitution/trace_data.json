        "fact": "To calculate fall damage with no Armour, it is quite simply. Just obtain the amount of blocks high you are, and then minus 3... For example at 22 and 23 blocks high, the same damage value of 19 is generated. However at 24 blocks high, 21 hearts [damage points/half-hearts] of damage is generated... Therefore it can be confirmed 23 blocks is the largest amount of blocks high, one with only armour/no armour/ blocking can survive from."

        "fact": "Generally, the way fall damage works is that you lose half of the heart of health for every block fallen after you pass the first three blocks. Assuming that you have a full health bar while falling, a fall should prove to be lethal once it exceeds 23 blocks (or 23.5 to be more exact)."
