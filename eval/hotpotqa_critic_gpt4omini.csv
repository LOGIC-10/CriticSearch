5a8a32d65542992d82986ef4,During the period known as the Second Red Scare Alexander Trachtenberg was convicted under which Act?,Smith Act,"
During the Second Red Scare, Alexander Trachtenberg was convicted under the **Smith Act**, formally known as the **Alien Registration Act of 1940**. This federal law was enacted in response to national security concerns and specifically criminalized the advocacy for the violent overthrow of the U.S. government, as well as membership in organizations that promoted such advocacy.

Trachtenberg, a prominent figure in the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and the founder of International Publishers, became a target of anti-communist sentiment during this era. His political activities made him vulnerable in a climate where public opinion was largely hostile towards communists. The first trial of Trachtenberg and ten other CPUSA leaders took place in **1949** and lasted nearly ten months. This trial occurred against a backdrop of significant public fear surrounding communism, exacerbated by events such as the Soviet Union's nuclear test and the communists' victory in the Chinese Civil War. The prosecution's case relied heavily on undercover informants and the testimony of individuals who interpreted communist texts, which contributed to a perception of the CPUSA as a direct threat to American democracy.

The jury found all eleven defendants guilty, leading to prison sentences of up to six years. The outcome was influenced not only by the prosecution's case but also by the prevailing anti-communist public sentiment, which arguably affected the trial proceedings and the willingness of jurors to acquit.

However, Trachtenberg's legal struggles were not over. His conviction in **1949** was eventually overturned due to the recantation of a key government witness, Harvey Matusow, whose testimony had originally played a critical role in the prosecution's arguments. This recantation raised serious questions about the reliability of the evidence against Trachtenberg and his co-defendants.

In **1951**, Trachtenberg was convicted once again under the Smith Act, but this second conviction was also overturned in **1958** by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. This decision was significantly influenced by the Supreme Court's ruling in **Yates v. United States (1957)**, which refined the legal standards for Smith Act prosecutions. The Court determined that individuals could only be prosecuted for inciting illegal actions rather than merely for their beliefs or political affiliations. This ruling represented a pivotal shift in legal interpretation, not only impacting Trachtenberg's case but also setting a precedent that would protect civil liberties and political expression amid the intense political repression of the period.

In summary, Trachtenberg's experiences highlight the complex interplay between legal frameworks, public sentiment, and political repression during the Red Scare, illustrating the challenges faced by individuals involved in leftist movements and the subsequent judicial pushback against the overreach of anti-communist legislation.

Jack M. Guttentag is a professor emeritus of finance at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). UCLA was established in 1881 primarily through philanthropic donations, initially functioning as the Los Angeles Branch of the California State Normal School. This establishment was largely driven by the need for educational facilities in Southern California, supported by significant contributions from local philanthropists.

Although UCLA officially opened its doors in 1882, the legislative action in 1881, which led to its founding, recognized the importance of donations and community support in its establishment. The institution was created to serve the educational needs of the growing population in Los Angeles and surrounding areas, marking a crucial step in the development of higher education in California.

In summary, UCLA was founded in 1881 with substantial support from donations, underscoring the critical role of philanthropy in its early establishment.

5a859a0c5542992a431d1b69,Do both Icehouse pieces and El Grande come from the same game?,no,"
No, Icehouse pieces and El Grande do not come from the same game. 

**El Grande** is a distinct German-style board game designed by Wolfgang Kramer and Richard Ulrich, first published in 1995. It involves area control mechanics set in Renaissance-era Spain and can be played by 2-5 players. El Grande is recognized for its strategic depth and has received several awards, including the Spiel des Jahres.

On the other hand, **Icehouse pieces** are a set of colored pyramids originally created for the game **Icehouse**, designed by Andrew Looney. Icehouse was first introduced in 1989 and serves as a base for various games that utilize these pyramid pieces. The Icehouse system allows for a wide variety of games, many of which are user-generated, and it encourages creativity in gameplay.

In summary, while both involve board gaming, they are separate entities with different origins, designs, and gameplay mechanics.

5ae4083755429970de88d885,"What stone cube, meaning ""stumbling stone"", was designed by an American public affairs campaigner?",stolperstein,"
The stone cube referred to as a ""stumbling stone"" is known as a **Stolperstein**, which literally translates to ""stumbling stone."" This project was initiated by German artist **Gunter Demnig** in 1992. Stolpersteine are small, concrete cubes, approximately 10 cm by 10 cm, that bear brass plates inscribed with the names, birth dates, and details of the fates of victims of Nazi extermination or persecution. Each stone is placed in front of the last voluntarily chosen residence of the individual commemorated.

While Gunter Demnig is the primary figure behind the Stolpersteine project, there are American initiatives that resonate with the concept of memorializing victims of historical injustices. For example, **Bryan Stevenson**, an American public affairs campaigner and founder of the **Equal Justice Initiative**, has created memorials that honor victims of racial terror and lynching in the United States. Although his work does not involve stone cubes like the Stolpersteine, it shares a similar ethos of remembrance and acknowledgment of past atrocities.

Furthermore, an artist named **Paul Growald** has developed a project called **Stopping Stones**, which memorializes enslaved individuals in the United States. While not directly related to the Stolpersteine initiative, it reflects a similar intention to recognize and honor historical injustices.

In summary, the Stolpersteine are a significant European memorialization effort initiated by Gunter Demnig, while similar American projects aim to confront and commemorate the legacies of systemic violence and oppression, demonstrating a broader commitment to remembering and honoring victims of historical atrocities.

5a8563c05542997b5ce3fff4,Do Chestnut and Arenga trees both grow in the northern hemisphere?,yes,"
Chestnut trees (genus Castanea) are primarily found in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in regions like Europe, Asia, and North America. Common species include the European chestnut (Castanea sativa) and the American chestnut (Castanea dentata).

Arenga trees, on the other hand, belong to the genus Arenga and are mainly tropical and subtropical palms. They are typically found in Southeast Asia and other warm regions, which means they do not naturally occur in the Northern Hemisphere's temperate zones.

In summary, chestnut trees grow in the Northern Hemisphere, while Arenga trees are generally found in warmer, tropical climates and are not native to the Northern Hemisphere.

The footballer who surpassed a German professional footballer known for achieving 18 clean sheets is **Alisson Becker**, the Brazilian goalkeeper for Liverpool FC. In the 2022/2023 season, Alisson not only showcased outstanding performances but also secured the Premier League Golden Glove award with 20 clean sheets, outpacing the German goalkeeper **Manuel Neuer**, who tallied 18 clean sheets during his season.

Alisson's exceptional display of goalkeeping helped Liverpool in their campaign, and he has been recognized as one of the top keepers in the world, often compared with greats like Neuer. This season's performance solidified his reputation and contributed significantly to his team's success.

For context, Manuel Neuer, a legendary figure in German football and captain of Bayern Munich, has historically been one of the most successful goalkeepers, known for his remarkable clean sheet records. However, during the 2022/2023 season, Alisson's achievements allowed him to stand out and earn accolades over his German counterpart.

In summary, Alisson Becker is the footballer who ""beat out"" Manuel Neuer despite Neuer's impressive 18 clean sheets.
