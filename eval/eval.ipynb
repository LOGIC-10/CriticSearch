      "John Clare1793—1864Share thisShareOriginal Artwork: Engraving after Hilton. (Photo by Edward Gooch Collection/Getty Images)John Clare is “the quintessential Romantic poet,” according to William Howard writing in theDictionary of Literary Biography.With an admiration of nature and an understanding of the oral tradition, but with little formal education, Clare penned numerous poems and prose pieces, many of which were only published posthumously. His works gorgeously illuminate the natural world and rural life, and depict his love for his wife Patty and for his childhood sweetheart Mary Joyce. Though his first book,Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery(1820),was popular with readers and critics alike, Clare struggled professionally for much of his life. His work only became widely read some hundred years after his death.Clare was born into a peasant family in the small English village of Helpston in 1793. Despite his disadvantaged background—both of his parents were virtually illiterate—Clare did receive some formal schooling as a youth. He attended a day school for a few months every year until he was about twelve years old, and then he went to night school, studied informally with other boys in the area, and read in his spare time. Clare’s favorite books includedDaniel Defoe’sRobinson Crusoeand Izaak Walton’sThe Compleat Angler.During his school days Clare met fellow student Mary Joyce and embarked upon a romantic relationship with her. Although the two eventually separated and Clare married Patty Turner, Clare would devote much of his later poetry to Mary.Although Clare had received some education, the work he did out of financial necessity consisted largely of manual labor such as gardening, ploughing, threshing, or lime-burning. Meanwhile, he began to write poetry. Clare was inspired to write his first poem,“The Morning Walk,”after reading James Thompson’sSeasons.As Clare began to write more, his parents unwittingly became his first critics. In order to ensure an honest, objective assessment, Clare would read his poetry to his parents as if it had been written by another author, keeping what they liked and scrapping what they didn’t. He soon accumulated a substantial poetry collection, which was published in 1820 by John Taylor (who also published the work ofJohn Keats) asPoems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery.Rural Liferanges over a variety of topics and themes, including nature, folk literature, social injustice, and the world of the mind, and it includes a number of poetic forms, such as descriptive verse, elegies, sonnets, and comic poems. In his introduction to the volume, Taylor defended Clare’s imitations of other poets (includingRobert Burns), his heavy use of dialect, and his occasionally incorrect grammar. Attributing these aspects of Clare’s work to his youth and disadvantaged background, Taylor asserted, “Clare… does not regard language in the same way that a logician does. He considers it collectively rather than in detail, and paints up to his mind’s original by mingling words, as a painter mixes his colours.”Rural Lifewas a success, selling three thousand copies and going through four editions within a year. It was generally well reviewed. AQuarterly Reviewcritic, for instance, found Clare to have “an animation, a vivacity, and a delicacy in describing rural scenery.” An example of Clare’s descriptive powers appears in the poem“Noon”: “All how silent and how still / Nothing heard but yonder mill; / While the dazzled eye surveys / All around a liquid blaze; / And amid the scorching gleams, / If we earnest look, it seems / As if crooked bits of glass / Seem’d repeatedly to pass.”Clare’s attempts at comedy, however, were considered by contemporary critics to be vulgar or objectionable. An example is Clare’s“My Mary,”a parody ofWilliam Cowper‘s poem “Mary”: “Who, save in Sunday’s bib and tuck, / Goes daily waddling like a duck, / O’er head and ears in grease and muck? / My Mary.” The poem was eliminated from later editions ofRural Life—an incident that was representative of a problem that would continue to occur throughout Clare’s career. According to Howard, “the audience that could afford to support him through the purchase of his books was not the audience that could understand the blend of country experience and literary allusion that he was providing.”The success ofRural Lifebrought Clare recognition and the assistance of several benefactors. He visited London that year, attending plays and dinner parties and hobnobbing with literary luminaries. Clare also married Patty Turner, who was already several months pregnant with their first child. Although the pressures of fame and family slowed his production somewhat, Clare soon published another collection,The Village Minstrel, and Other Poems(1821).ThoughThe Village Minstrelincludes a variety of poetic styles similar to those inRural Life,the themes of the volume are more limited. Clare focuses on “the value of country sports and customs,” according to Howard, although other topics include the consequences of enclosing lands that were once commonly owned and the plight of the gypsies. In“The Gipsy’s Camp”Clare wrote: “My rambles led me to a gipsy’s camp, / Where the real effigy of midnight hags, / With tawny smoked flesh and tatter’d rags, / Uncouth-brimm’d hat, and weather-beaten cloak, / ‘Neath the wild shelter of a knotty oak, / Along the greensward uniformly pricks / Her pliant bending hazel’s arching sticks.”WithThe Village MinstrelClare was on his way to creating a more distinctive style. Howard noted that the sonnet“Summer Tints”“includes a good example of Clare’s maturing descriptive powers”: “How sweet I’ve wandered bosom-deep in grain, / When Summer’s mellowing pencil sweeps his / shade / Of ripening tinges o’er the chequer’d plain: / Light tawny oat-lands with a yellow blade; / And bearded corn, like armies on parade.” AlthoughThe Village Minstreldid not enjoy the wide success ofRural Life,the book sold respectably and the critical reception was generally favorable, with many reviewers praising Clare’s development as a poet. Clare garnered acclaim for his depictions of rural life and, according to Howard, aLiterary Gazettereviewer believed that “several of the poems… will raise the reputation of the rustic bard above his former fame.”Clare’s next major effort to be published wasThe Shepherd’s Calendar(1827).Though the poet derived the idea for the book from the work ofEdmund Spenser, Howard noted that “his eventual treatment of Spenser’s idea goes beyond imitation to the creation of a new, contemporary version of pastoral, rooted in the soil of English… country life.” In the first section ofThe Shepherd’s CalendarClare devises a poem for each month of the year, offering a celebration of rural life with a shepherd figuring throughout. Other pieces include“Poesy”and“The Dream,”a darkly written description of a nightmare.The Shepherd’s Calendardid not garner the critical attention or public interest that Clare’s earlier work did: critics were divided regarding the merits of the collection. According to Howard, aLondon Weekly Reviewcritic referred to“The Dream“as an “absurd piece of doggrel and bombast,” whereas aLiterary Chroniclereviewer found the same poem to “possess… an almost Byronic strength and originality.” The collection was praised byEclectic Revieweditor Josiah Conder, however, who asserted that the book “exhibits very unequivocal signs of intellectual growth, an improved taste, and an enriched mind.”Although Clare had to contend with physical and mental illness in the years following the publication ofThe Shepherd’s Calendar,he was able to recover sufficiently to produceThe Rural Muse,which was published in 1835.The Rural Museincludes songs, sonnets, and autobiographical poems. Though Howard considered some of the pieces “disappointing,” he noted that others “demonstrate just how far Clare had progressed in his craft.” Howard praised the originality of“Autumn,”in which Clare describes the changing of the seasons: “Thy pencil dashing its excess of shades, / Improvident of waste, till every bough / Burns with thy mellow touch / Disorderly divine.” WithThe Rural Musecritical and public interest in Clare’s work continued to dwindle. The attention that the book did bring, however, was generally quite positive. ANew Monthly Magazinereviewer stated that Clare had demonstrated “a far superior finish, and a much greater command over the resources of language and metre” than he had in his earlier work. In Howard’s opinion, Clare’s editors excluded many of the poet’s best pieces fromThe Rural Muse.“Clare’s reputation might, in fact, have been more enhanced by this volume had it included more of those sonnets which Clare had originally proposed for it.”The Rural Musewas the last major collection published in Clare’s lifetime. He continued to write, but his mental and physical health weakened during the late 1830s and his doctor recommended that he recuperate in an asylum. In 1836 Clare was admitted to High Beech asylum, where he was allowed considerable freedom to write poetry and stroll the grounds. The poet missed his family, however, and soon became dissatisfied with this situation. In 1841 Clare walked away from the asylum and continued to walk until he reached his home four days later. His stay was relatively brief, though, since he was becoming increasingly difficult for Patty to manage. Clare was admitted to Northampton Lunatic Asylum—where he was to spend the rest of his life—five months after he left High Beech.During this period, Clare “had begun to live in the mind and seemed to have a confused idea of himself, a confusion which mixes strangely and revealingly with a scrupulously unself-pitying clarity of description,” according toDictionary of Literary Biographycontributor R. K. R. Thornton. Clare’s asylum poetry includes“Don Juan”and“Child Harold,”which were derived from the work of Lord Byron.“Don Juan,”written in what Howard termed “earthy” language, is a “rambling discourse on sexuality, morality, and politics.”“Child Harold”concerns the character of poets and love, and much of the work addresses Mary Joyce, with Patty relegated to the status of “other” wife. Howard considered“Child Harold”to be “unmistakably Clare’s most original work.”Many of Clare’s other poems of this period are traditional love verses and songs written to various women, especially Mary Joyce. The poet still created original work, however. Howard cites“A Favourite Place”as one of Clare’s “impressive array of original lyrics”: “Beautiful gravel walks overgrown / with moss & grass little places where / the poet sat to write.” Some of Clare’s later work, according to Howard, offers “momentary glimpses into Clare’s mind that reveal his continuing delusions but also something of the anguish that resulted from his partial sanity.” One of Clare’s letters, written in 1860, reads: “Dear Sir, I am in a Madhouse & quite forget your Name or who you are you must excuse me for I have nothing to communicate or tell of & why I am shut up I dont know I have nothing to say so I conclude yours respectfully John Clare.”After more than twenty years at Northampton, Clare died in 1864. New editions and previously unpublished collections of his work continued to be released after his death. The more recent editions of Clare’s work, including Eric Robinson and Geoffrey Summerfield’s editions ofThe Later Poems of John ClareandThe Shepherd’s Calendar,have reinstated Clare’s idiosyncrasies in language, spelling, and punctuation, which were “corrected” by his editors in early versions. Clare’s opinion of the rules of grammar was quoted by Thornton: “do I write intelligable I am generally understood tho I do not use that awkward squad of pointings called commas colons semicolons &c & for the very reason that altho they are drilled hourly daily weekly by every boarding school Miss who pretends to gossip in correspondence they do not know their proper exercise for they even set grammarians at loggerheads and no one can asign them their proper places.”Clare’s work continues to attract readers, poets, and scholars. In the 20th century, poets especially rediscovered Clare:John Ashberywrote both a poem to Clare, “For John Clare,” and wrote about him in his bookOther Traditions(2000). And scholars now recognize Clare as an important poet and prose writer. “As an observer of what it was like in England in the early nineteenth century, not only for the peasant but also from a peasant point of view, he is irreplaceable,” declared Thornton. In Clare’s prose, Thornton concluded, “we… see reflected there in sharp clarity the very essence of a period, a place, a language, a culture, and a time.”Poems by John ClareAutumnThe Dying ChildFirst LoveSee All Poems by John ClarearrowRightRelated ContentRelated CollectionsPoems of Sorrow and GrievingBritish RomanticismRelated PodcastsFirst LovePoverty’s History, Episode 1: In the Beginning Was the WordRelated ArticlesDruidic Differencep1Et AlJohn Clare: “To John Clare”See All Related ContentarrowRightMore About This PoetCategories:1781-1900RomanticEuropeNorthern EuropeEnglandPoems by This PoetRelatedBibliographyAutumnThe Dying ChildFirst LoveI Am!I Hid my LoveLove Lives Beyond the TombMeet Me in the Green GlenThe SkylarkSummerSummer ImagesTo John ClareWhat is Life?The Yellowhammer's NestShow More\n",

      "Structures7 Oldest Banks in The WorldBankinghas been a part of life since the early days of human civilization as ancient merchants made loans of grain to farmers and traders who carried goods between cities. This type of trading was known as the barter system and it was the precursor to the world’s earliest banks.The prototypes for modern banking originated in the medieval and early Renaissance periods of Italy. Around this time, one of the most famous banks in history, Medici Bank, was established. Although these early banks no longer exist, the banks on this list have been in continuous operation for several centuries.The oldest bank on this list existed at the same time as the famousMedici Bank, which shut down in 1494.7.

      "Viktor Raychev played as a defender for Lokomotiv Sofia. In football, the primary role of a defender is to prevent the opposing team from scoring by blocking attacks, intercepting passes, and tackling opposing players. Defenders are crucial for maintaining the team's defensive structure, providing support during set pieces, and often initiating counter-attacks by distributing the ball effectively to midfielders and forwards. Raychev's position as a defender implies that his main responsibilities on the field included safeguarding the goal area and contributing to the overall defensive strategy of Lokomotiv Sofia during his time with the club.\n",

      "Maurice RavelFrom New World EncyclopediaJump to:navigation,searchPrevious (Maurice Merleau-Ponty)Next (Mauritania)Maurice RavelMaurice Ravel, 1912Background informationBirth nameJoseph-Maurice RavelBornMarch 7, 1875Ciboure,FranceDiedDecember 28, 1937 (age 62)Paris,FranceGenre(s)ImpressionistOccupation(s)Composer, pianistJoseph-Maurice Ravel(March 7, 1875 – December 28, 1937) was a twentieth-centuryFrenchcomposerand pianist, known especially for the subtlety, richness and poignancy of hismusic. His piano, chamber music and orchestral works have become staples of repertoire.Ravel's piano compositions, such asMiroirsandGaspard de la Nuit, are virtuosic, and his orchestrations, as inDaphnis et Chloéand his arrangement ofModest Mussorgsky'sPictures at an Exhibition, are notable for their effective use of tonal color and variety of sound and instrumentation.To the general public, Ravel is probably best known for his orchestral work,Bolero, which he considered trivial and once described as \"a piece for orchestra without music.\" Still, upon closer inspection,Boleroreveals Ravel's brilliant, and often adventurous orchestrational technique.Contents1Biography2Musical style3Musical Influence4Notable compositions5References6External links7CreditsThough Ravel's harmonic idiom resembled the \"impressionist\" aspects similar to those of his contemporary,Claude Debussy, his harmonies remained functional in keeping with traditional \"classical\" practice. A number of his later works reveal the influence of AmericanJazzfor its melodic, harmonic and rhythmic characteristics; moreover, he knew and admired Geroge Gershwin. He was also influenced by themusicofSpainand several of his works, most notably,Rhapsodie espagnole, contain significant Spanish musical properties. This curiosity of music of other cultures and nationalities indicates an openness and appreciation of ethonomusicology.BiographyRavel was born in Ciboure,Francenear Biarritz, part of the French Basque Country region, bordering onSpain. His mother, Marie Delouart, was Basque while his father, Joseph Ravel, was a Swiss inventor and industrialist. A few of Joseph's inventions are quite important. Among them is an early internal combustion engine as well as a notorious circus machine, \"The Whirlwind of Death\" (an automotive loop-the-loop that was quite a hit in the early 1900s). After the family moved to Paris, Ravel's younger brother Edouard was born. At seven years old, young Maurice began piano lessons and composed pieces beginning about five or six years later. His parents encouraged his musical pursuits and sent him to the Conservatoire de Paris, first as a preparatory student and eventually as a piano major. During his schooling in Paris, Ravel joined with a number of innovative young artists who referred to themselves as the \"Les Apaches\" or 'hooligans' because of their wild abandon. The group was well known for its drunken revelry.He studied music at the Conservatoire under Gabriel Fauré for a remarkable fourteen years. During his years at the conservatory, Ravel tried numerous times to win the prestigious Prix de Rome, but to no avail. After a scandal involving his loss of the prize in 1905 (to Victor Gallois), even though he was considered the favorite to win that year, Ravel left the conservatory. The incident—named the Ravel Affair by the Parisian press—also led to the resignation of the Conservatoire's director, Théodore Dubois.While many critics claim Ravel was influenced by composerClaude Debussy, Ravel himself claimed he was much more influenced byMozartand Couperin, whose compositions are much more structured and classical in form. Ravel and Debussy were, however, clearly the defining composers of the Impressionist music movement. Ravel was also highly influenced by music from around the world including AmericanJazz, Asian music, and traditional folk music from across Europe. Ravel had left the Roman Catholic Church and was a self-declaredatheist, although he was also a spiritualist like many skeptics of his generation. He disliked the overtly religious themes of other composers, and instead preferred to look to classical mythology for inspiration. In 1907, after the premiere ofHistoires Naturellesa controversy erupted. Pierre Lalo criticized the work as plagiarism of Debussy; however, criticism was quickly silenced after theRhapsodie espagnolewas received with such high critical acclaim.Ravel later worked with ballet choreographer Sergei Diaghilev who stagedMa Mère l'OyeandDaphnis et Chloé. The latter was commissioned by Diaghilev with the lead danced by the greatVaslav Nijinsky. Ravel continued his feud with the French musical establishment. In 1920, the French government awarded him with the Légion d'honneur, but Ravel refused. Soon, he retired to the French countryside where he continued to write music albeit less prolifically.In 1928, Ravel for the first time began a piano tour inAmerica. InNew York City, he received a moving standing ovation which he remarked was unlike any of his underwhelming premieres in Paris. That same year,Oxford Universityawarded him with an honorary doctorate.Ravel never married, but he did have several long-running relationships. Many of his friends have suggested that Ravel was known to frequent the bordellos of Paris, but the issue of his sexuality remains largely a mystery.Though Ravel considered his small size and light weight an advantage to becoming a pilot, during theFirst World War, he was not allowed to enlist as a pilot because of his age and weak health. Instead, upon his enlistment, Maurice Ravel became a truck driver. He named his truck \"Adelaide.\" Most references to what he drove in the war indicate it was an artillery truck or generic truck. No first hand reference mentions him driving an ambulance.His few students includedMaurice Delage,Manuel RosenthalandRalph Vaughan Williams.In 1932, Ravel was involved in an automobile accident that severely undermined his health. His output dropped dramatically. In 1937, he had a neuro-operation that he hoped would restore much of his health, but the operation was a failure and he died soon afterwards. He is buried in Levallois Perret (North-West part of Paris, France).Musical styleRavel considered himself in many ways a classicist. He relied on traditional forms and structures as ways of presenting his new and innovative harmonies. He often masked the sections of his structure with transitions that disguised the beginnings of the motif. This is apparent in hisValses nobles et sentimentales—inspired byFranz Schubert's collections,Valses noblesandValses sentimentales—where the seven movements begin and end without pause, and in his chamber music where many movements are in sonata-allegro form, hiding the change from developmental sections to recapitulation.Though Ravel's music has tonal centers, it was innovative for the time period. In keeping with the French school pioneered by composers such as Chabrier,Satie, andDebussy, Ravel's melodies are almost exclusively modal. Instead of using major or minor for his predominant harmonic language, he preferred modes with major or minor flavors, for example, the Mixolydian mode with its lowered leading tone, instead of major, and the Aeolian mode instead of minor. As a result, there are virtually no leading tones in his output. Melodically, he tended to favor two modes, the Dorian mode and the Phrygian mode. He was in no way dependent on the modes exclusively for he used extended harmonies and intricate modulations outside the realm of traditional modal practices. Ravel was fond of chords of the ninth and eleventh, and the acidity of his harmonies is largely the result of a fondness for unresolved appoggiaturas (seeValses Nobles et Sentimentales). His piano music, some of which is noted for its technical challenges (seeGaspard de la nuit), was an extension of Lisztian virtuosity. Even his most difficult pieces, however, are marked by elegance and refinement. He was inspired by various dances, his favorite being the minuet. Other forms from which Ravel drew material include the forlane, rigaudon, waltz, czardas, the habanera, passacaglia, and the bolero.Ravel has almost always been considered one of the two great French musical Impressionists (the other being Debussy), but in reality he is much more than just an Impressionist. In hisA la maniere de...Borodine(In the manner of...Borodine), Ravel plays with the ability to both mimic and remain original. In a more complex situation,A la maniere de...Emmanuel Chabrier /Paraphrase sur un air de Gounod (\"Faust IIème acte\"), Ravel takes on a theme from Gounod's operaFaustand arranges it in the style of Emmanuel Chabrier. Even in writing in the style of others, Ravel's own voice as a composer remained distinct.Ravel had very meticulously crafted manuscripts. Unfortunately, early printed editions of his works were prone to errors. Painstakingly, he worked with his publisher, Durand, in correcting them. In a letter, Ravel wrote that when proofingL'enfant et les sortilèges, after many other editors had proofread theopera, he could still find ten errors per page. Each piece was carefully crafted, although Ravel wished that, like the historical composers he admired, he could write a great quantity of works.Igor Stravinskyonce referred to Ravel as the \"Swiss Watchmaker,\" a reference to the intricacy and precision of Ravel's works.Musical InfluenceOn the surface, he was influenced by Debussy, but also the music ofRussia,Spainand the jazz music of theUnited States, as reflected in the movement titledBluesfrom his G major violin sonata. He also once stated that he had never written a piece not influenced byEdvard Grieg.In 1928, Ravel wrote that composers should be aware of both individual and national consciousness. That year, Ravel had toured theUnited StatesandCanadaby train performing piano recitals in the great concert halls of twenty-five cities. In their reluctance to take jazz and blues as a nationalistic style of music, he stated America's composers' \"greatest fear is to find themselves confronted by mysterious urges to break academic rules rather than belie individual consciousness. Thereupon these musicians, good bourgeois as they are, compose their music according to the classical rules of the European epoch.\" When American composerGeorge Gershwinmet Ravel, he mentioned that he would have liked to study with the French composer if that were possible. The Frenchman retorted, \"Why should you be a second-rate Ravel when you can be a first-rate Gershwin?\"His two piano concertos in many ways reflect the style of Gershwin. Of the Concerto in G, Ravel said the concertos ofMozartandSaint-Saënsserved as his models. He intended to write an earlier concerto,Zazpiak Bat, but it was never finished. The title reflects his Basque heritage, meaning 'The Seven Are One'. It refers to the seven Basque regions, and was a motto often used in connection with the idea of a Basque nation. Surviving notes and fragments also confirm that this naturally was to be heavily influenced by Basque music. Instead, Ravel abandoned the piece, using its nationalistic themes and rhythms in some of his other pieces.Ravel commented that André Gédalge, his professor ofcounterpoint, was very important in the development of his skill as a composer. As an orchestrator, Ravel studied the ability of each instrument carefully in order to determine the possible effects. This may account for the success of his orchestral transcriptions, both of his own piano works and those of other composers, such asModest Mussorgsky.In the aforementionedBolero, the composer's keen ear for orchestrational timbre combined with his uncanny ability to create novel and decidedly original colors is displayed to great effect. In one particular passage he harmonizes the main theme, played by a solo hornmf(moderately loud), while having two piccolos playing the third and fifth partials in the harmonic seriespp(very soft) and the celesta playing the second and fourth partialsp(soft.) The resulting effect is highly exotic and exhibits Ravel's ability to create strikingly original orchestral colors, a hallmark of his music.Notable compositionsMenuet antique(piano, 1895, orchestrated in 1929)Schéhérazade (ouverture de féerie)(1897)Jeux d'eau(piano, 1901)String Quartet in F(1903)Schéhérazade(orchestral song cycle, 1903)Sonatine(piano, 1903-1905)Miroirs(Mirrors)III.Une barque sur l'océan(\"A Boat over the Ocean\" solo piano 1905, orchestra 1906)IV.Alborada del gracioso(\"Aubade of the Clown\") (piano 1905, orchestra 1918)Histoires naturelles(\"Natural Histories\") (song cycle, 1906)Rapsodie espagnole(\"Spanish Rhapsody\") (orchestra, 1907)L'heure espagnole(\"The Spanish Hour\") (opera, 1907–1909)Gaspard de la nuit(\"Phantom of the Night\") (piano, 1908)Pavane pour une infante défunte(\"Pavane for a Dead Princess\") (piano 1899, orchestra 1910)Ma Mère l'Oye(\"Mother Goose\") (piano duet 1908–1910, ballet 1911)Daphnis et Chloé(\"Daphne and Chloé\") (ballet, 1909–1912)Valses nobles et sentimentales(\"Noble and Sentimental Waltzes\") (piano 1911, orchestra 1912)Piano Trio in A minor(1914)Le Tombeau de Couperin(\"The Tomb of Couperin\") (piano 1914–1917, orchestra 1919)Sonata for Violin and CelloSonata for Violin and PianoLa Valse(choreographic poem, 1906–1914 and 1919–1920)L'enfant et les sortilèges(\"The Child and the Spells,\" lyric fantasy, 1920–1925, libretto by Colette 1917)Tzigane(violin and piano, 1924)Bolero(ballet, 1928)Piano Concerto for the Left Hand in D(1929–1930)Concerto in G(1929–1931)Don Quichotte à Dulcinée(songs, 1932–1933)ReferencesISBN links support NWE through referral feesIvry, Benjamin.Maurice Ravel: a life.

His family background was an artistic andcultivatedone, and the young Maurice received every encouragement from his father when his talent formusicbecame apparent at an early age. In 1889, at 14, he entered the Paris Conservatoire, where he remained until 1905. During this period he composed some of his best known works, including thePavane for a Dead Princess,theSonatinefor piano, and theString Quartet.All these works, especially the two latter, show the astonishing early perfection of style and craftsmanship that are the hallmarks of Ravel’s entireoeuvre. He is one of the rare composers whose early works seem scarcely less mature than those of his maturity. Indeed, his failure at the Conservatoire, after three attempts, to win the covetedPrix de Romeforcomposition(the works he submitted were judged too “advanced” by ultraconservative members of the jury) caused something of a scandal. Indignant protests were published, and liberal-minded musicians and writers, including the musicologist and novelistRomain Rolland, supported Ravel. As a result, the director of the Conservatoire,Théodore Dubois, was forced to resign, and his place was taken by the composerGabriel Fauré, with whom Ravel had studied composition.Maurice RavelMaurice Ravel, c. 1928.(more)Ravel was in no sense a revolutionary musician. He was for the most part content to work within the established formal and harmonic conventions of his day, still firmly rooted in tonality—i.e., the organization of music around focal tones. Yet, so very personal and individual was hisadaptationand manipulation of the traditional musicalidiomthat it would be true to say he forged for himself a language of his own that bears the stamp of his personality as unmistakably as any work of Bach orChopin. While his melodies are almost always modal (i.e., based not on the conventional Westerndiatonic scalebut on the old Greek Phrygian and Dorian modes), his harmonies derive their often somewhat acid flavour from his fondness for “added” notes and unresolved appoggiaturas, or notes extraneous to the chord that are allowed to remain harmonically unresolved. He enriched the literature of the piano by a series of masterworks, ranging from the earlyJeux d’eau(completed 1901) and theMiroirsof 1905 to theformidableGaspard de la nuit(1908),Le Tombeau de Couperin(1917), and the two piano concerti (1931). Of his purely orchestral works, theRapsodie espagnoleandBoléroare the best known and reveal hisconsummatemastery of the art of instrumentation. But perhaps the highlights of his career were his collaboration with the Russian impresarioSerge Diaghilev, for whoseBallets Russeshe composed the masterpieceDaphnis et Chloé,and with the French writerColette, who was the librettist of his best known opera,L’Enfant et les sortilèges.The latter work gave Ravel an opportunity of doing ingenious and amusing things with the animals and inanimate objects that come to life in this tale of bewitchment and magic in which a naughty child is involved. His only other operatic venture had been his brilliantly satiricalL’Heure espagnole(first performed 1911). As a songwriterRavelachieved great distinction with his imaginativeHistoires naturelles, Trois poèmes de Stéphane Mallarmé,andChansons madécasses.Britannica QuizComposers & Their MusicRavel’s life was in the main uneventful. He never married, and, though he enjoyed the society of a few chosen friends, he lived the life of a semi-recluse at his country retreat at Montfort-L’Amaury, in the forest of Rambouillet, nearParis. He served inWorld War Ifor a short time as a truck driver at the front, but the strain was too great for his fragile constitution, and he was discharged from the army in 1917.In 1928 Ravel embarked on a four months’ tour of Canada and theUnited Statesand in the same year visited England to receive an honorary degree of doctor of music from Oxford. That year also saw the creation ofBoléroin its original form as a ballet, withIda Rubinsteinin the principal role.The last five years of Ravel’s life were clouded byaphasia, which not only prevented him from writing another note of music but also deprived him of the power of speech and made it impossible for him even to sign his name. Perhaps the real tragedy of his condition was that his musical imagination remained as active as ever. An operation to relieve the obstruction of ablood vesselthat supplies the brain was unsuccessful. Ravel was buried in the cemetery of Levallois, a Parissuburbin which he had lived, in the presence of Stravinsky and other distinguished musicians and composers.For Ravel, music was a kind of ritual, having its own laws, to be conducted behind high walls, sealed off from the outside world, and impenetrable to unauthorized intruders. When his Russian contemporaryIgor Stravinskycompared Ravel to “the most perfect of Swiss watchmakers,” he was in fact extolling those qualities of intricacy and precision to which he himself attached so much importance.Are you a student?Get a special academic rate on Britannica Premium.SubscribeRollo H.

For other uses, seeRavel (disambiguation).Ravel in 1925Joseph Maurice Ravel[n 1](7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor. He is often associated withImpressionismalong with his elder contemporaryClaude Debussy, although both composers rejected the term. In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer.Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, theParis Conservatoire; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements ofmodernism,baroque,neoclassicismand, in his later works,jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work,Boléro(1928), in which repetition takes the place of development. Renowned for his abilities inorchestration, Ravel made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' piano music, of which his 1922 version ofMussorgsky'sPictures at an Exhibitionis the best known.A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries. Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music. Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration. Some of his piano music, such asGaspard de la nuit(1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such asDaphnis et Chloé(1912) require skilful balance in performance.Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public. From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision.Retrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maurice_Ravel&oldid=1260017856\"Categories:Maurice Ravel1875 births1937 deaths19th-century French classical composers20th-century French male classical pianists19th-century French male musicians20th-century French classical composers20th-century French conductors (music)Ballets Russes composersBurials at Levallois-Perret CemeteryComposers for pianoNeurological disease deaths in FranceFrench atheistsFrench ballet composersFrench-Basque peopleFrench military personnel of World War IFrench opera composersFrench people of Basque descentFrench people of Swiss descentHonorary members of the Royal Philharmonic SocietyImpressionist composersJazz-influenced classical composersLegion of Honour refusalsFrench male opera composersNeoclassical composersPeople from LabourdPeople with traumatic brain injuriesPrix de Rome for compositionHidden categories:Pages with French IPAWebarchive template wayback linksPages containing links to subscription-only contentComposers with IMSLP linksArticles with International Music Score Library Project linksArticles with short descriptionShort description is different from WikidataFeatured articlesUse dmy dates from December 2022Use British English from January 2017Articles with hAudio microformatsCS1 French-language sources (fr)Pages using Sister project links with hidden wikidata\n",

      "Paul HindemithFrom New World EncyclopediaJump to:navigation,searchPrevious (Paul Gauguin)Next (Paul Klee)Paul Hindemith, aged 28Paul Hindemith(November 16, 1895 – December 28, 1963) was an outstanding twentieth-century German composer, as well as a violist, teacher, theorist, and conductor. Hindemith helped to create a new conception of tonality with the 12-tone scale while retaining the traditional anchor of a tonic or foundational tone. His works and teachings in the United States made him very popular, especially in the 1940s when he used consonance and dissonance to set apart the melodic and harmonic lines of a composition for emphasis and expression.Contents1Biography2Hindemith's music3Social responsibility of artists andMathis der Maler4Partial list of works5Notable students6Trivia7Notes8References9External links10CreditsBiographyBorn in Hanau, Germany, Hindemith was taught the violin as a child. He entered the Hochsche Konservatorium in Frankfurt am Main where he studied conducting, composition, and violin under Arnold Mendelssohn and Bernhard Sekles, supporting himself by playing in dance bands and musical-comedy groups. He led the Frankfurt Opera orchestra from 1915 to 1923 and played in the Rebner string quartet in 1921 in which he played second violin, and later the viola. In 1929 he founded the Amar Quartet, playing the viola, and toured Europe extensively.In 1922, some of his pieces were heard at the International Society for Contemporary Music festival in Salzburg, which first brought him to the attention of an international audience. The following year, he began to work as an organizer of the Donaueschingen Festival, where his programs featured works by several avant garde composers includingAnton WebernandArnold Schoenberg. Starting in 1927 he taught composition at the Berliner Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, and in the 1930s he made several visits to Ankara where (at the invitation of Atatürk) he led the task of reorganizingTurkish musiceducation. Towards the end of the 1930s, he made several tours of America as a viola and viola d'amore soloist.In the 1920s, as he was establishing his reputation as one of Germany’s emerging musical talents, he was considered an uncompromising iconoclast, anenfant terrible,due to the dissonant nature of his scores. Today much of his music sounds relatively tame in comparison to the post-World War II purveyors of serialism; however, at a time when the echoes of Romanticism were still in the ears (and hearts) of the general public, his early music often came across as being acerbic and uningratiating. As he matured he modified his compositional style and as a result many of his important scores remain in the active repertory of soloists and ensembles due to their melodic expressiveness, harmonic integrity, and structural logic. Though not everyone finds his music agreeable, few argue that it is the product of a highly intelligent and gifted composer.As his reputation grew in the 1930s, theNaziscondemned his music as \"degenerate,\" despite protests from the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, and in 1940 Hindemith emigrated to the USA. (He was not himself Jewish, but his wife was.) At the same time that he was codifying his musical language, his teaching began to be affected by his theories. Once in the States he taught primarily atYale Universitywhere he had such notable pupils as Lukas Foss, Norman Dello Joio, Harold Shapero, Ruth Schonthal, andOscar-winning film director George Roy Hill. During this time he also held the Charles Eliot Norton Chair atHarvard, from which his bookA Composer's Worldwas extracted. He became an American citizen in 1946, but returned to Europe in 1953, living in Zürich and teaching at the university there. Towards the end of his life he began to conduct more, and made numerous recordings, mostly of his own music. He was awarded the Balzan Prize in 1962.Hindemith died in Frankfurt am Main on December 28, 1963 from acute pancreatitis.Hindemith's musicBy the 1930s Hindemith had become the most prominent German composer sinceRichard Strauss. His early works are in a lateromanticidiom, and he later producedexpressionistworks, rather in the style of earlyArnold Schoenberg, before developing a leaner,contrapuntallycomplex style in the 1920s, which some people found (and still find) difficult to understand. It has been described asneoclassical, but is different from the neo-classic works ofIgor Stravinskyowing to the contrapuntal style ofJohann Sebastian Bachrather than the classical clarity ofWolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In fact, Hindemith's music represented the Neo-Baroque.This new style can be heard in the series of works he wrote calledKammermusik (Chamber Music)from 1922 to 1927. Each of these pieces is written for a different small instrumental ensemble, many of them very unusual.Kammermusik No. 6,for example, is a concerto for the viola d'amore, an instrument that had not been in wide use since thebaroqueperiod, but which Hindemith himself played. He continued to write for unusual groups throughout his life, producing asonatafor double bass in 1949, for example.Around the 1930s, Hindemith began to write less forchamberensembles, and more for larger orchestral groups. During the years 1933–35, Hindemith composed his operaMathis der Malerbased on the life of the painter Matthias Grünewald. It is respected in musical circles, but like most twentieth-century operas it is rarely staged, though a well-known production by the New York City Opera in 1995 was an exception.[1]It combines the neo-classicism of earlier works with folk song. Hindemith turned some of the music from this opera into a purely instrumental symphony (also calledMathis der Maler), which is one of his most frequently performed works.Hindemith, like Kurt Weill and Ernst Krenek, wroteGebrauchsmusik (Utility Music),music intended to have a social or political purpose and often intended to be played by amateurs. The concept was inspired by Bertolt Brecht. An example of this is hisTrauermusik (Funeral Music),written in 1936. Hindemith was preparing a concert for the BBC when he heard news of the death ofGeorge V. He quickly wrote this piece for solo viola and string orchestra to mark the event, and the premiere was given on the same day. Hindemith later disowned the termGebrauchsmusik,saying it was misleading.In the late 1930s, Hindemith wrote a theoretical book,The Craft of Musical Composition,in which he ranks all musical intervals from the most consonant to the most dissonant. It laid out the compositional technique he had been using throughout the 1930s and would continue to use for the rest of his life, and added to his reputation as a composer theoretically interesting, but lacking in emotional interest. His piano work of the early 1940s,Ludus Tonalis,is seen by many as a further example of this. It contains twelve fugues, in the manner ofJohann Sebastian Bach, each connected by an interlude during which the music moves from thekeyof the last fugue to the key of the next one. Much of Hindemith's music begins in consonant territory, moves into dissonance, and returns at the end to full, consonant chords. This is especially apparent in his \"Concert Music for Strings and Brass\" which was commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra to commemorate its 50th anniversary.Hindemith's most popular work, both on record and in the concert hall, is probably theSymphonic Metamorphoses of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber,written in 1943. It takesmelodiesfrom various works byvon Weber, mainly piano duets, but also one from the overture to his incidental music forTurandot(Op. 37/J. 75), and transforms and adapts them so that each movement of the piece is based on one theme.In 1951, Hindemith completed hisSymphony in B-flat.Scored for concert band, it was written for an occasion when he guest conducted the U.S. Army Band \"Pershing's Own.\" The piece is representative of his late works, exhibiting strong contrapuntal lines throughout, and is a cornerstone of the band repertoire.Social responsibility of artists andMathis der MalerIn many respects there was an egalitarian aspect to Hindemith’s character in that he felt a responsibility to compose music that could reach a greater number of people, amateurs as well as professionals.Gebrauchmusik(functional music) andHausmusik(music to be played in the home) were terms attributed to much of the music that he composed for these purposes. He wrote a great deal of music that can be categorized asGebrauchmusik,but whether he was writing for the popular theater, brass bands, children, or more serious occasions, his craftsmanship invariably reflects the work of a consummate professional.The events that shapedGermany’s political and cultural destiny in the decade of the 1930s had grave and far-reaching impacts upon German artists of every discipline, and like his contemporaries, Hindemith’s life and work were being profoundly affected by the political ascent of the Third Reich. By 1934Adolf Hitlerand theNaziparty had attained the kind of political power few would have imagined only a decade earlier.In 1933, only Richard Strauss was held in higher esteem among German composers than Paul Hindemith. As Hindemith’s prestige grew internationally, he came under increased pressure to proclaim loyalty to the Nazi party. Hindemith, however, remained forthright and somewhat defiant in his objections to Hitler’s demands. Having a Jewish wife made the situation particularly difficult for Hindemith and it wasn’t long before the German Chamber of Culture began to denigrate his music and the Nazi press began labeling him a “cultural Bolshevik.”It was under these conditions that Hindemith produced his most significant work, his fourth opera,Mathis der Maler (Mathis the Painter).The libretto, Hindemith’s own, uses the Peasant’s War of 1524 as its historical backdrop with its central character, Renaissance painter Matthais Grunewald (c.1475–1528), ensnared in a conflict between the peasants and the church. The primary theme of the opera deals with the moral and ethical responsibility of the artist at a time of social upheaval. The Nazis viewedMathisas a deliberate attempt by Hindemith to fan the flames of dissent and many believed that the composer was depicting himself as the protagonist in the opera.The Nazis were further aggravated when Wilhelm Furtwangler, then the director of the Berlin State Opera and Germany's most distinguished conductor, agreed to stage the work causing an uproar that subsequently made Hindemith’s relationship with the authorities even more precarious. Though Furtwangler attempted to defend the composer, he was nonetheless pressured by the Nazi officialdom to abort the project.Hindemith remained undaunted and proceeded to compose a symphony based on the score of the opera. Using the 11-panel Altarpiece that Grunewald had painted in the Church of Saint Anthony at Isenheim between 1512 and 1515 as a source of inspiration, Hindemith’s three-movementSymphonie – Mathis der Malerstands as a testament to his indomitable will and creative spirit. The premiere of the symphony was conducted by Furtwangler at a Berlin Philharmonic concert on March 12, 1934 and was an unequivocal success.Energized by the public’s response to Hindemith’s brilliant score, Furtwangler initiated new attempts to have the opera produced. However, political pressures mounted once again and in an attempt to mollify the the authorities, Furtwangler came to the composer’s defense in a letter that was published inDeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.Furtwangler testified to the Germanic qualities of Hindemith’s work, stating that “...one would be obliged to portray him, whose blood is also purely Germanic, as an outspoken German type. German in the high quality and straightforwardness of his craft as in the chastity and restraint of his relatively rare outbreaks of emotion. The latest work of his to appear, the symphony from the operaMathis der Maler,has only confirmed this impression.”Furtwangler’s efforts to ameliorate the situation only exacerbated the vexatious relationship between Hindemith and the Nazis and Hitler personally issued an order to desist any and all attempts to produce the opera. Furtwangler incurred the wrath of the party as well and was discharged from his positions with both the Berlin Philharmonic and the State Opera and remained a musical exile for a year. The operaMathis der Malereventually received its premier in Zurich in 1938 and was first staged in theUnited StatesinBostonin 1956. The first German production ofMathistook place after World War II in 1946.Vilified by “Die Furher,” his music banned, and relieved of all his duties at the Berlin Academy of Music, Hindemith was now confronted with the dilemma facing all artists living inGermanyduringHitler’s nefarious reign: Either join the Nazi party in order to further one's artistic ambitions, or suffer the consequences of incarceration, exile, or possibly worse. As an individual of staunch moral convictions, Hindemith would not acquiesce to a political philosophy that he considered morally repugnant; thus he chose to leave his native Germany and pursue his creative endeavors elsewhere.After a brief time in Switzerland, Hindemith made his first visit to theUnited Statesin the spring of 1937 where he made his American debut at the Coolidge Festival in Washington, D.C. performing hisSonata for Unaccompanied Viola.In the following years he returned to teach composition at the Boston Symphony’s Berkshire Music Center in Tanglewood and in 1940, with war now imminent in Europe, he moved to the United States where he promptly received an appointment to join the music faculty at Yale University.Partial list of works(Complete list available on the web)[2]String Quartet No. 3 in C,Op. 22 (1922)Piano Concerto for the Left Hand,written for Paul Wittgenstein (1923)Der SchwanendreherSymphonic Metamorphoses on Themes of WeberMathis der Maler(symphony) (1933–1934)Mathis der Maler(opera) (1934–1935)Trauermusik(1936)Kammermusik(1936)Sonata for Flute and Piano(1936)Nobilissima Visione ballet,with Leonide Massine (1938)Sonata for Bassoon and Piano(1938)Sonata for Trumpet and Piano(1939)Sonata for Oboe and Piano(1939)Sonata for Clarinet and Piano(1939)Sonata for Horn and Piano(1939)Sonata for Trombone and Piano(1941)Sonatas for Viola,Op. 11 and Op. 25When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd(Requiem for Those We Love),for chorus and orchestra, based on the poem byWalt Whitman(1946)Symphony in B-flat for Concert Band(1951)Sonata for Tuba and Piano(1955)Ludus TonalisDas MarienlebenSongcycle for soprano and piano, based on poems by Rainer Maria Rilke, which exists in two versions.

He founded theAmar Quartetin 1921, touring extensively in Europe. As a composer, he became a major advocate of theNeue Sachlichkeit(New Objectivity) style of music in the 1920s, with compositions such asKammermusik, including works with viola andviola d'amoreas solo instruments in a neo-Bachianspirit.

He sought to revitalize tonality—the traditional harmonic system that was being challenged by many other composers—and also pioneered in the writing ofGebrauchsmusik, or “utilitymusic,”compositionsfor everyday occasions. He regarded the composer as a craftsman (turning out music to meet social needs) rather than as an artist (composing to satisfy his own soul). As a teacher ofcompositionhe probably exerted an influence on most of the composers of the generation that followed him.Hindemith earned his living at an early age playing theviolinin cafes, dance bands, and theatres. His undertaking of almost any kind of musical job may have contributed to the facility and matter-of-factness with which he later composed. Studying music in Frankfurt, at 20 he became leader of the Frankfurt Opera Orchestra.Meanwhile, his own compositions were being heard at international festivals of contemporary music. Early works includedchamber musiccomposed for the Amar-Hindemith Quartet, in which he played the viola; thesongcyclesDie junge Magd(1922; “The Young Maid”), based on poems byGeorg Trakl, andDas Marienleben(1924, rev. 1948; “The Life of Mary”); and the operaCardillac(1926), based onE.T.A. Hoffmann’sDas Fräulein von Scuderi(“The Girl from Scuderi”). By the late 1920s Hindemith was regarded as the foremost German composer of his generation.Britannica QuizComposers & Their MusicThe “utility” music he wrote for children’s games, youth groups, brass bands, radio plays, and other practical purposes reflected a functional trend in thecultureof postwarGermany. HindemithcollaboratedwithKurt Weillon the music for a radio cantata byBertolt Brecht,Der Lindberghflug(1928; “The Lindbergh Flight”).His greatest work,Mathis der Maler, an opera about the painterMatthias Grünewaldand his struggles with society, caused a public imbroglio inNaziGermany whenWilhelm Furtwänglerconducted an orchestral version with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1934 and vigorously supported the opera in the press. The Nazi cultural authorities, led by JosephGoebbels(minister of propaganda), banned the opera, denouncing the composer as a “cultural Bolshevist” and “spiritual non-Aryan.”Hindemith, who had been professor of composition at theBerlinAcademy of Music since 1927, left Germany forTurkey, where he set up a music education system on Western lines and taught at the conservatory inAnkara(1935–37). Later he taught atYale University(1940–53) and at the University ofZürich(1951–58).Hindemith, PaulPaul Hindemith.(more)His early music was considered anti-Romantic and iconoclastic, but it also showed humour, exuberance, and inventiveness. HisKammermusikseries—for small, unconventional, astringent groups of instruments—is outstanding. He also produced such works as theViolin Concerto(1939), theCello Concerto(1940), theSymphonic Metamorphoses After Themes by Carl Maria von Weber(1946), and the operasDie Harmonie der Welt(1957; “The Harmony of the World”) andThe Long Christmas Dinner(1961).Are you a student?Get a special academic rate on Britannica Premium.SubscribeAn opponent of the12-toneschool of composerArnold Schoenberg, Hindemith formulated the principles of a harmonic system that was based on an enlargement of traditionaltonality.

      "Maurice RavelFrom New World EncyclopediaJump to:navigation,searchPrevious (Maurice Merleau-Ponty)Next (Mauritania)Maurice RavelMaurice Ravel, 1912Background informationBirth nameJoseph-Maurice RavelBornMarch 7, 1875Ciboure,FranceDiedDecember 28, 1937 (age 62)Paris,FranceGenre(s)ImpressionistOccupation(s)Composer, pianistJoseph-Maurice Ravel(March 7, 1875 – December 28, 1937) was a twentieth-centuryFrenchcomposerand pianist, known especially for the subtlety, richness and poignancy of hismusic. His piano, chamber music and orchestral works have become staples of repertoire.Ravel's piano compositions, such asMiroirsandGaspard de la Nuit, are virtuosic, and his orchestrations, as inDaphnis et Chloéand his arrangement ofModest Mussorgsky'sPictures at an Exhibition, are notable for their effective use of tonal color and variety of sound and instrumentation.To the general public, Ravel is probably best known for his orchestral work,Bolero, which he considered trivial and once described as \"a piece for orchestra without music.\" Still, upon closer inspection,Boleroreveals Ravel's brilliant, and often adventurous orchestrational technique.Contents1Biography2Musical style3Musical Influence4Notable compositions5References6External links7CreditsThough Ravel's harmonic idiom resembled the \"impressionist\" aspects similar to those of his contemporary,Claude Debussy, his harmonies remained functional in keeping with traditional \"classical\" practice. A number of his later works reveal the influence of AmericanJazzfor its melodic, harmonic and rhythmic characteristics; moreover, he knew and admired Geroge Gershwin. He was also influenced by themusicofSpainand several of his works, most notably,Rhapsodie espagnole, contain significant Spanish musical properties. This curiosity of music of other cultures and nationalities indicates an openness and appreciation of ethonomusicology.BiographyRavel was born in Ciboure,Francenear Biarritz, part of the French Basque Country region, bordering onSpain. His mother, Marie Delouart, was Basque while his father, Joseph Ravel, was a Swiss inventor and industrialist. A few of Joseph's inventions are quite important. Among them is an early internal combustion engine as well as a notorious circus machine, \"The Whirlwind of Death\" (an automotive loop-the-loop that was quite a hit in the early 1900s). After the family moved to Paris, Ravel's younger brother Edouard was born. At seven years old, young Maurice began piano lessons and composed pieces beginning about five or six years later. His parents encouraged his musical pursuits and sent him to the Conservatoire de Paris, first as a preparatory student and eventually as a piano major. During his schooling in Paris, Ravel joined with a number of innovative young artists who referred to themselves as the \"Les Apaches\" or 'hooligans' because of their wild abandon. The group was well known for its drunken revelry.He studied music at the Conservatoire under Gabriel Fauré for a remarkable fourteen years. During his years at the conservatory, Ravel tried numerous times to win the prestigious Prix de Rome, but to no avail. After a scandal involving his loss of the prize in 1905 (to Victor Gallois), even though he was considered the favorite to win that year, Ravel left the conservatory. The incident—named the Ravel Affair by the Parisian press—also led to the resignation of the Conservatoire's director, Théodore Dubois.While many critics claim Ravel was influenced by composerClaude Debussy, Ravel himself claimed he was much more influenced byMozartand Couperin, whose compositions are much more structured and classical in form. Ravel and Debussy were, however, clearly the defining composers of the Impressionist music movement. Ravel was also highly influenced by music from around the world including AmericanJazz, Asian music, and traditional folk music from across Europe. Ravel had left the Roman Catholic Church and was a self-declaredatheist, although he was also a spiritualist like many skeptics of his generation. He disliked the overtly religious themes of other composers, and instead preferred to look to classical mythology for inspiration. In 1907, after the premiere ofHistoires Naturellesa controversy erupted. Pierre Lalo criticized the work as plagiarism of Debussy; however, criticism was quickly silenced after theRhapsodie espagnolewas received with such high critical acclaim.Ravel later worked with ballet choreographer Sergei Diaghilev who stagedMa Mère l'OyeandDaphnis et Chloé. The latter was commissioned by Diaghilev with the lead danced by the greatVaslav Nijinsky. Ravel continued his feud with the French musical establishment. In 1920, the French government awarded him with the Légion d'honneur, but Ravel refused. Soon, he retired to the French countryside where he continued to write music albeit less prolifically.In 1928, Ravel for the first time began a piano tour inAmerica. InNew York City, he received a moving standing ovation which he remarked was unlike any of his underwhelming premieres in Paris. That same year,Oxford Universityawarded him with an honorary doctorate.Ravel never married, but he did have several long-running relationships. Many of his friends have suggested that Ravel was known to frequent the bordellos of Paris, but the issue of his sexuality remains largely a mystery.Though Ravel considered his small size and light weight an advantage to becoming a pilot, during theFirst World War, he was not allowed to enlist as a pilot because of his age and weak health. Instead, upon his enlistment, Maurice Ravel became a truck driver. He named his truck \"Adelaide.\" Most references to what he drove in the war indicate it was an artillery truck or generic truck. No first hand reference mentions him driving an ambulance.His few students includedMaurice Delage,Manuel RosenthalandRalph Vaughan Williams.In 1932, Ravel was involved in an automobile accident that severely undermined his health. His output dropped dramatically. In 1937, he had a neuro-operation that he hoped would restore much of his health, but the operation was a failure and he died soon afterwards. He is buried in Levallois Perret (North-West part of Paris, France).Musical styleRavel considered himself in many ways a classicist. He relied on traditional forms and structures as ways of presenting his new and innovative harmonies. He often masked the sections of his structure with transitions that disguised the beginnings of the motif. This is apparent in hisValses nobles et sentimentales—inspired byFranz Schubert's collections,Valses noblesandValses sentimentales—where the seven movements begin and end without pause, and in his chamber music where many movements are in sonata-allegro form, hiding the change from developmental sections to recapitulation.Though Ravel's music has tonal centers, it was innovative for the time period. In keeping with the French school pioneered by composers such as Chabrier,Satie, andDebussy, Ravel's melodies are almost exclusively modal. Instead of using major or minor for his predominant harmonic language, he preferred modes with major or minor flavors, for example, the Mixolydian mode with its lowered leading tone, instead of major, and the Aeolian mode instead of minor. As a result, there are virtually no leading tones in his output. Melodically, he tended to favor two modes, the Dorian mode and the Phrygian mode. He was in no way dependent on the modes exclusively for he used extended harmonies and intricate modulations outside the realm of traditional modal practices. Ravel was fond of chords of the ninth and eleventh, and the acidity of his harmonies is largely the result of a fondness for unresolved appoggiaturas (seeValses Nobles et Sentimentales). His piano music, some of which is noted for its technical challenges (seeGaspard de la nuit), was an extension of Lisztian virtuosity. Even his most difficult pieces, however, are marked by elegance and refinement. He was inspired by various dances, his favorite being the minuet. Other forms from which Ravel drew material include the forlane, rigaudon, waltz, czardas, the habanera, passacaglia, and the bolero.Ravel has almost always been considered one of the two great French musical Impressionists (the other being Debussy), but in reality he is much more than just an Impressionist. In hisA la maniere de...Borodine(In the manner of...Borodine), Ravel plays with the ability to both mimic and remain original. In a more complex situation,A la maniere de...Emmanuel Chabrier /Paraphrase sur un air de Gounod (\"Faust IIème acte\"), Ravel takes on a theme from Gounod's operaFaustand arranges it in the style of Emmanuel Chabrier. Even in writing in the style of others, Ravel's own voice as a composer remained distinct.Ravel had very meticulously crafted manuscripts. Unfortunately, early printed editions of his works were prone to errors. Painstakingly, he worked with his publisher, Durand, in correcting them. In a letter, Ravel wrote that when proofingL'enfant et les sortilèges, after many other editors had proofread theopera, he could still find ten errors per page. Each piece was carefully crafted, although Ravel wished that, like the historical composers he admired, he could write a great quantity of works.Igor Stravinskyonce referred to Ravel as the \"Swiss Watchmaker,\" a reference to the intricacy and precision of Ravel's works.Musical InfluenceOn the surface, he was influenced by Debussy, but also the music ofRussia,Spainand the jazz music of theUnited States, as reflected in the movement titledBluesfrom his G major violin sonata. He also once stated that he had never written a piece not influenced byEdvard Grieg.In 1928, Ravel wrote that composers should be aware of both individual and national consciousness. That year, Ravel had toured theUnited StatesandCanadaby train performing piano recitals in the great concert halls of twenty-five cities. In their reluctance to take jazz and blues as a nationalistic style of music, he stated America's composers' \"greatest fear is to find themselves confronted by mysterious urges to break academic rules rather than belie individual consciousness. Thereupon these musicians, good bourgeois as they are, compose their music according to the classical rules of the European epoch.\" When American composerGeorge Gershwinmet Ravel, he mentioned that he would have liked to study with the French composer if that were possible. The Frenchman retorted, \"Why should you be a second-rate Ravel when you can be a first-rate Gershwin?\"His two piano concertos in many ways reflect the style of Gershwin. Of the Concerto in G, Ravel said the concertos ofMozartandSaint-Saënsserved as his models. He intended to write an earlier concerto,Zazpiak Bat, but it was never finished. The title reflects his Basque heritage, meaning 'The Seven Are One'. It refers to the seven Basque regions, and was a motto often used in connection with the idea of a Basque nation. Surviving notes and fragments also confirm that this naturally was to be heavily influenced by Basque music. Instead, Ravel abandoned the piece, using its nationalistic themes and rhythms in some of his other pieces.Ravel commented that André Gédalge, his professor ofcounterpoint, was very important in the development of his skill as a composer. As an orchestrator, Ravel studied the ability of each instrument carefully in order to determine the possible effects. This may account for the success of his orchestral transcriptions, both of his own piano works and those of other composers, such asModest Mussorgsky.In the aforementionedBolero, the composer's keen ear for orchestrational timbre combined with his uncanny ability to create novel and decidedly original colors is displayed to great effect. In one particular passage he harmonizes the main theme, played by a solo hornmf(moderately loud), while having two piccolos playing the third and fifth partials in the harmonic seriespp(very soft) and the celesta playing the second and fourth partialsp(soft.) The resulting effect is highly exotic and exhibits Ravel's ability to create strikingly original orchestral colors, a hallmark of his music.Notable compositionsMenuet antique(piano, 1895, orchestrated in 1929)Schéhérazade (ouverture de féerie)(1897)Jeux d'eau(piano, 1901)String Quartet in F(1903)Schéhérazade(orchestral song cycle, 1903)Sonatine(piano, 1903-1905)Miroirs(Mirrors)III.Une barque sur l'océan(\"A Boat over the Ocean\" solo piano 1905, orchestra 1906)IV.Alborada del gracioso(\"Aubade of the Clown\") (piano 1905, orchestra 1918)Histoires naturelles(\"Natural Histories\") (song cycle, 1906)Rapsodie espagnole(\"Spanish Rhapsody\") (orchestra, 1907)L'heure espagnole(\"The Spanish Hour\") (opera, 1907–1909)Gaspard de la nuit(\"Phantom of the Night\") (piano, 1908)Pavane pour une infante défunte(\"Pavane for a Dead Princess\") (piano 1899, orchestra 1910)Ma Mère l'Oye(\"Mother Goose\") (piano duet 1908–1910, ballet 1911)Daphnis et Chloé(\"Daphne and Chloé\") (ballet, 1909–1912)Valses nobles et sentimentales(\"Noble and Sentimental Waltzes\") (piano 1911, orchestra 1912)Piano Trio in A minor(1914)Le Tombeau de Couperin(\"The Tomb of Couperin\") (piano 1914–1917, orchestra 1919)Sonata for Violin and CelloSonata for Violin and PianoLa Valse(choreographic poem, 1906–1914 and 1919–1920)L'enfant et les sortilèges(\"The Child and the Spells,\" lyric fantasy, 1920–1925, libretto by Colette 1917)Tzigane(violin and piano, 1924)Bolero(ballet, 1928)Piano Concerto for the Left Hand in D(1929–1930)Concerto in G(1929–1931)Don Quichotte à Dulcinée(songs, 1932–1933)ReferencesISBN links support NWE through referral feesIvry, Benjamin.Maurice Ravel: a life.

      "Paul HindemithFrom New World EncyclopediaJump to:navigation,searchPrevious (Paul Gauguin)Next (Paul Klee)Paul Hindemith, aged 28Paul Hindemith(November 16, 1895 – December 28, 1963) was an outstanding twentieth-century German composer, as well as a violist, teacher, theorist, and conductor. Hindemith helped to create a new conception of tonality with the 12-tone scale while retaining the traditional anchor of a tonic or foundational tone. His works and teachings in the United States made him very popular, especially in the 1940s when he used consonance and dissonance to set apart the melodic and harmonic lines of a composition for emphasis and expression.Contents1Biography2Hindemith's music3Social responsibility of artists andMathis der Maler4Partial list of works5Notable students6Trivia7Notes8References9External links10CreditsBiographyBorn in Hanau, Germany, Hindemith was taught the violin as a child. He entered the Hochsche Konservatorium in Frankfurt am Main where he studied conducting, composition, and violin under Arnold Mendelssohn and Bernhard Sekles, supporting himself by playing in dance bands and musical-comedy groups. He led the Frankfurt Opera orchestra from 1915 to 1923 and played in the Rebner string quartet in 1921 in which he played second violin, and later the viola. In 1929 he founded the Amar Quartet, playing the viola, and toured Europe extensively.In 1922, some of his pieces were heard at the International Society for Contemporary Music festival in Salzburg, which first brought him to the attention of an international audience. The following year, he began to work as an organizer of the Donaueschingen Festival, where his programs featured works by several avant garde composers includingAnton WebernandArnold Schoenberg. Starting in 1927 he taught composition at the Berliner Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, and in the 1930s he made several visits to Ankara where (at the invitation of Atatürk) he led the task of reorganizingTurkish musiceducation. Towards the end of the 1930s, he made several tours of America as a viola and viola d'amore soloist.In the 1920s, as he was establishing his reputation as one of Germany’s emerging musical talents, he was considered an uncompromising iconoclast, anenfant terrible,due to the dissonant nature of his scores. Today much of his music sounds relatively tame in comparison to the post-World War II purveyors of serialism; however, at a time when the echoes of Romanticism were still in the ears (and hearts) of the general public, his early music often came across as being acerbic and uningratiating. As he matured he modified his compositional style and as a result many of his important scores remain in the active repertory of soloists and ensembles due to their melodic expressiveness, harmonic integrity, and structural logic. Though not everyone finds his music agreeable, few argue that it is the product of a highly intelligent and gifted composer.As his reputation grew in the 1930s, theNaziscondemned his music as \"degenerate,\" despite protests from the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, and in 1940 Hindemith emigrated to the USA. (He was not himself Jewish, but his wife was.) At the same time that he was codifying his musical language, his teaching began to be affected by his theories. Once in the States he taught primarily atYale Universitywhere he had such notable pupils as Lukas Foss, Norman Dello Joio, Harold Shapero, Ruth Schonthal, andOscar-winning film director George Roy Hill. During this time he also held the Charles Eliot Norton Chair atHarvard, from which his bookA Composer's Worldwas extracted. He became an American citizen in 1946, but returned to Europe in 1953, living in Zürich and teaching at the university there. Towards the end of his life he began to conduct more, and made numerous recordings, mostly of his own music. He was awarded the Balzan Prize in 1962.Hindemith died in Frankfurt am Main on December 28, 1963 from acute pancreatitis.Hindemith's musicBy the 1930s Hindemith had become the most prominent German composer sinceRichard Strauss. His early works are in a lateromanticidiom, and he later producedexpressionistworks, rather in the style of earlyArnold Schoenberg, before developing a leaner,contrapuntallycomplex style in the 1920s, which some people found (and still find) difficult to understand. It has been described asneoclassical, but is different from the neo-classic works ofIgor Stravinskyowing to the contrapuntal style ofJohann Sebastian Bachrather than the classical clarity ofWolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In fact, Hindemith's music represented the Neo-Baroque.This new style can be heard in the series of works he wrote calledKammermusik (Chamber Music)from 1922 to 1927. Each of these pieces is written for a different small instrumental ensemble, many of them very unusual.Kammermusik No. 6,for example, is a concerto for the viola d'amore, an instrument that had not been in wide use since thebaroqueperiod, but which Hindemith himself played. He continued to write for unusual groups throughout his life, producing asonatafor double bass in 1949, for example.Around the 1930s, Hindemith began to write less forchamberensembles, and more for larger orchestral groups. During the years 1933–35, Hindemith composed his operaMathis der Malerbased on the life of the painter Matthias Grünewald. It is respected in musical circles, but like most twentieth-century operas it is rarely staged, though a well-known production by the New York City Opera in 1995 was an exception.[1]It combines the neo-classicism of earlier works with folk song. Hindemith turned some of the music from this opera into a purely instrumental symphony (also calledMathis der Maler), which is one of his most frequently performed works.Hindemith, like Kurt Weill and Ernst Krenek, wroteGebrauchsmusik (Utility Music),music intended to have a social or political purpose and often intended to be played by amateurs. The concept was inspired by Bertolt Brecht. An example of this is hisTrauermusik (Funeral Music),written in 1936. Hindemith was preparing a concert for the BBC when he heard news of the death ofGeorge V. He quickly wrote this piece for solo viola and string orchestra to mark the event, and the premiere was given on the same day. Hindemith later disowned the termGebrauchsmusik,saying it was misleading.In the late 1930s, Hindemith wrote a theoretical book,The Craft of Musical Composition,in which he ranks all musical intervals from the most consonant to the most dissonant. It laid out the compositional technique he had been using throughout the 1930s and would continue to use for the rest of his life, and added to his reputation as a composer theoretically interesting, but lacking in emotional interest. His piano work of the early 1940s,Ludus Tonalis,is seen by many as a further example of this. It contains twelve fugues, in the manner ofJohann Sebastian Bach, each connected by an interlude during which the music moves from thekeyof the last fugue to the key of the next one. Much of Hindemith's music begins in consonant territory, moves into dissonance, and returns at the end to full, consonant chords. This is especially apparent in his \"Concert Music for Strings and Brass\" which was commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra to commemorate its 50th anniversary.Hindemith's most popular work, both on record and in the concert hall, is probably theSymphonic Metamorphoses of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber,written in 1943. It takesmelodiesfrom various works byvon Weber, mainly piano duets, but also one from the overture to his incidental music forTurandot(Op. 37/J. 75), and transforms and adapts them so that each movement of the piece is based on one theme.In 1951, Hindemith completed hisSymphony in B-flat.Scored for concert band, it was written for an occasion when he guest conducted the U.S. Army Band \"Pershing's Own.\" The piece is representative of his late works, exhibiting strong contrapuntal lines throughout, and is a cornerstone of the band repertoire.Social responsibility of artists andMathis der MalerIn many respects there was an egalitarian aspect to Hindemith’s character in that he felt a responsibility to compose music that could reach a greater number of people, amateurs as well as professionals.Gebrauchmusik(functional music) andHausmusik(music to be played in the home) were terms attributed to much of the music that he composed for these purposes. He wrote a great deal of music that can be categorized asGebrauchmusik,but whether he was writing for the popular theater, brass bands, children, or more serious occasions, his craftsmanship invariably reflects the work of a consummate professional.The events that shapedGermany’s political and cultural destiny in the decade of the 1930s had grave and far-reaching impacts upon German artists of every discipline, and like his contemporaries, Hindemith’s life and work were being profoundly affected by the political ascent of the Third Reich. By 1934Adolf Hitlerand theNaziparty had attained the kind of political power few would have imagined only a decade earlier.In 1933, only Richard Strauss was held in higher esteem among German composers than Paul Hindemith. As Hindemith’s prestige grew internationally, he came under increased pressure to proclaim loyalty to the Nazi party. Hindemith, however, remained forthright and somewhat defiant in his objections to Hitler’s demands. Having a Jewish wife made the situation particularly difficult for Hindemith and it wasn’t long before the German Chamber of Culture began to denigrate his music and the Nazi press began labeling him a “cultural Bolshevik.”It was under these conditions that Hindemith produced his most significant work, his fourth opera,Mathis der Maler (Mathis the Painter).The libretto, Hindemith’s own, uses the Peasant’s War of 1524 as its historical backdrop with its central character, Renaissance painter Matthais Grunewald (c.1475–1528), ensnared in a conflict between the peasants and the church. The primary theme of the opera deals with the moral and ethical responsibility of the artist at a time of social upheaval. The Nazis viewedMathisas a deliberate attempt by Hindemith to fan the flames of dissent and many believed that the composer was depicting himself as the protagonist in the opera.The Nazis were further aggravated when Wilhelm Furtwangler, then the director of the Berlin State Opera and Germany's most distinguished conductor, agreed to stage the work causing an uproar that subsequently made Hindemith’s relationship with the authorities even more precarious. Though Furtwangler attempted to defend the composer, he was nonetheless pressured by the Nazi officialdom to abort the project.Hindemith remained undaunted and proceeded to compose a symphony based on the score of the opera. Using the 11-panel Altarpiece that Grunewald had painted in the Church of Saint Anthony at Isenheim between 1512 and 1515 as a source of inspiration, Hindemith’s three-movementSymphonie – Mathis der Malerstands as a testament to his indomitable will and creative spirit. The premiere of the symphony was conducted by Furtwangler at a Berlin Philharmonic concert on March 12, 1934 and was an unequivocal success.Energized by the public’s response to Hindemith’s brilliant score, Furtwangler initiated new attempts to have the opera produced. However, political pressures mounted once again and in an attempt to mollify the the authorities, Furtwangler came to the composer’s defense in a letter that was published inDeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.Furtwangler testified to the Germanic qualities of Hindemith’s work, stating that “...one would be obliged to portray him, whose blood is also purely Germanic, as an outspoken German type. German in the high quality and straightforwardness of his craft as in the chastity and restraint of his relatively rare outbreaks of emotion. The latest work of his to appear, the symphony from the operaMathis der Maler,has only confirmed this impression.”Furtwangler’s efforts to ameliorate the situation only exacerbated the vexatious relationship between Hindemith and the Nazis and Hitler personally issued an order to desist any and all attempts to produce the opera. Furtwangler incurred the wrath of the party as well and was discharged from his positions with both the Berlin Philharmonic and the State Opera and remained a musical exile for a year. The operaMathis der Malereventually received its premier in Zurich in 1938 and was first staged in theUnited StatesinBostonin 1956. The first German production ofMathistook place after World War II in 1946.Vilified by “Die Furher,” his music banned, and relieved of all his duties at the Berlin Academy of Music, Hindemith was now confronted with the dilemma facing all artists living inGermanyduringHitler’s nefarious reign: Either join the Nazi party in order to further one's artistic ambitions, or suffer the consequences of incarceration, exile, or possibly worse. As an individual of staunch moral convictions, Hindemith would not acquiesce to a political philosophy that he considered morally repugnant; thus he chose to leave his native Germany and pursue his creative endeavors elsewhere.After a brief time in Switzerland, Hindemith made his first visit to theUnited Statesin the spring of 1937 where he made his American debut at the Coolidge Festival in Washington, D.C. performing hisSonata for Unaccompanied Viola.In the following years he returned to teach composition at the Boston Symphony’s Berkshire Music Center in Tanglewood and in 1940, with war now imminent in Europe, he moved to the United States where he promptly received an appointment to join the music faculty at Yale University.Partial list of works(Complete list available on the web)[2]String Quartet No. 3 in C,Op. 22 (1922)Piano Concerto for the Left Hand,written for Paul Wittgenstein (1923)Der SchwanendreherSymphonic Metamorphoses on Themes of WeberMathis der Maler(symphony) (1933–1934)Mathis der Maler(opera) (1934–1935)Trauermusik(1936)Kammermusik(1936)Sonata for Flute and Piano(1936)Nobilissima Visione ballet,with Leonide Massine (1938)Sonata for Bassoon and Piano(1938)Sonata for Trumpet and Piano(1939)Sonata for Oboe and Piano(1939)Sonata for Clarinet and Piano(1939)Sonata for Horn and Piano(1939)Sonata for Trombone and Piano(1941)Sonatas for Viola,Op. 11 and Op. 25When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd(Requiem for Those We Love),for chorus and orchestra, based on the poem byWalt Whitman(1946)Symphony in B-flat for Concert Band(1951)Sonata for Tuba and Piano(1955)Ludus TonalisDas MarienlebenSongcycle for soprano and piano, based on poems by Rainer Maria Rilke, which exists in two versions.

If you're going to comment, at least read the whole review and not just a quarter of it. I'm so sick of repeating myself over and over in the comments.Yes, I bash the author first, but I do make my points on why I hated the book itself, and not just because of him.Thank you.Sincerely, Kat.First of all, before I get into the book, I'd like to say that Orson Scott Card is one of the biggest dicks on this Earth. For those of who don't know, he is openly homophobic and a hyprocrite (www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_...)). He is a Chauvinist (known to believe that women are the weaker sex and were only put on this world to make babies). He is a Mormon that, from what I've heard from people who've read his other books, tries to convert you in his own writing in his novels.Just for this author's personality, this book deserves one star.But now onto the actual book, which deserves one star in itself.The Author's Viewpoints Leak InIt starts out well enough. It's interesting and keeps your attention. But immediately, the sexism shows its ugly face;\"All the boys are organized into armies.\"\"All boys?\"\"A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them.\"Keep in mind that this book is supposed to take place in the future. There are several things wrong with this sentence.1. In this day and age, thousands of women are in the military and fighting for their country. They have been for decades now, and longer still. So if this is supposed to be in the future, does Card think that women will give up their ability to fight so easily?2. Centuries of evolution working against them? On what terms? That we have ovaries? That we can have babies so are therefore unfit to fight or have the mental capacity to pass the tests boys can easily pass?This is the 21st century, genius. Women work. Women are in the army. Get your head out of your ass and look around, for fuck's sakes.CharactersI feel that Card made all the characters far too young. Ender is six, Valentine is eight, and Peter is ten. Peter has a fetish for torturing squirrels and threatening to kill his siblings.Um, okay? Is there any explanation for this strange behavior? No, because according to this book, all our kids in the future are fully functioning psychopaths. (Except the girls, of course. They're too 'mild' for behavior like that.)In the future, the army is apparently full of kids barely older than six, up to age twelve. To be trained for a war that, as far as I could tell from the point I got to, was already won.WritingThe writing was atrocious. Card switches from third person perspective to first person constantly. The first person switches are for the character's 'thoughts', but the words aren't italicized or anything so you can never tell.To me, that's a sign of bad writing. If you can't stick with one kind of perspective, than you should go back to those non-existent creative writing classes.PlotTowards the middle of the book, the plot started to seriously drag and get outright ridiculous. Valentine and Peter start planning to 'take over the world' by writing fucking debate columns. Not only is the whole 'let's rule the world' concept highly overused, it's poorly planned out. It's randomly thrown into the story like, \"Okay, we need more villains and more things happening, so let's make the ten year old girl and twelve year old murderous boy try to take over the world!......with debate columns.\"Sure.Then, switching back to Ender, who is now nine years old and a commander of his own kid army, we have our main character turning into the bullying idiots that bullied him in the beginning of the book. Has he learned nothing? Oh sure, it makes the kids 'better soldiers'. They're not even seven years old, they arenotfucking soldiers. The whole story is a fucked up version of a 'kid military' which is run by controlling adults who don't want the war to end so they can remain in power.It--just--ugh.It got so tedious and irritating that I decided to give up on it. I'm not going to waste my time with a book written by a sexist, homophobic, dickwad. I'm not even going to see the movie, which is a real shame because I love Asa Butterfield. I feel bad that he was brought into such a stupid book/movie business.le-sighnot-worth-the-hypetake-yo-sexist-ass-out-of-here...more1,542 likes1,035 commentsLikeCommentR43 reviews245 followersJuly 7, 2015[I have a new website where I review awesome books & more!http://unlearner.com]I wanted to like Ender's Game. I really did. It's a wonder that even after more than halfway into the book, I still clung on to the foolishly optimistic notion that the book would somehow redeem itself. That it would end up justifying the tedious, repetitive, drearily dull chapters I trundled through over the course of several days (which is unusual, since I'm generally a fast reader).It pains me to say it, as a hardcore fangirl of science fiction, that one of sci-fi's most beloved and highly regarded novels did not do it for me. Actually, that is understating it. While I'm at it, I'll just duck and blurt it out: I loathed Ender's Game.Deep breaths. Let that sink in. Let the hate flow through you. Good, strike me down...I am unarmed.Okay. Now let's get to it.Was it because the expectations I had in my mind were unreasonably high and thus were responsible for ruining the book for me? No way. I make no bones about the fact that Ender's Game, regardless of the respect and popularity it commands in sci-fi circles, is an inherently bad novel.Why, though, you might ask. Why such vitriol for the book? Here you are, then.1) Bad plotting:It didn't take me long to realise that after I was past Ender's arrival at the Battle School, every - literally every chapter thereon until his return to Earth - was more or less the same thing. Battle games, beating the shit out of kids, battle games, switching back and forth to Armies, battle games. It was so repetitive that I was exhausted at the end of every.single.chapter. Page after page after page of six year old, seven year old, eight year old Ender and his buddies zooming about in ships trying to freeze one another's socks off. Wheeee!2) Lack of characterisation:There are no personalities. There are no motivations. You never learn anything about the characters except that they are the good guys or the bad guys. Ender is brilliant at everything. He NEVER loses. Not once. Bernard, Stilson and Co. are the bad guys. They're evil baddies cause dey r jealuz of ender's brilliance omg!!! That's it. No background, no depth, no internal conflicts. No motivation. Words cannot express how two-dimensional and woefully lacking in personality the characters are.3) Demosthenes and Locke.What the heck was that all about? I appreciate Card's prescience about the 'Nets' and blogging before it was around, but come on, this is pushing it a bit too far. How, I beg you,howare we supposed to take the idea that a pair of kids end up taking the world byposting in online forums and blogging?As if we people of the internet didn't have enough delusions of grandeur already. ;)4) Now, this really gets my goat:I had to wait for the last 20 pages to get information that was of any worth to the story at all. I'm talking about Mazer's Rackham explaningthe buggger's communications systemto Ender. As for the 'twist ending': I honestly, and I mean, honestly did not find that riveting. It was predictable and, worse, did not justify all that I had to read to make my way to the end.5)Also:It was hard tofeelfor Ender. I say this as a high-school nerd in my own day, as the reviled and hated and made-fun-of socially awkward kid who wanted to be good at whatever they did. But that doesn't make me any more sympathetic to Ender. Honestly, I fail to see what's so great about Ender anyway. I am so infuriated at Card for this. Apart from Ender's claim to intelligence (which is never completely explained, by the way) there is nothing, NOTHING, that is worth justifying him as the protagonist of one of scifi's supposedly best books ever. Yes, he loves his sister Valentine. Yes, he doesn't want to hurt people. Yes, he goes ahead and does it anyway. Again and again.(Ending up murdering two school boys in the process. Uhm, major wtf there.)I am rarely so caustic about the books I read, but this time I feel I am justified in doing so. I had such hopes for this book. Not impossibly high or anything. At the very least, I had expected tolikeit, you know? I remember, as I worked my way past chapters 4,5,7,10,14...I expected it to get better. I expected myself to be mistaken at the initial dissatisfaction, then incredulity, then mild annoyance and then a string of sad sighs and resignation to dislike. Alas, I wasn't mistaken. I felt betrayed. I thought this book was right up there with those 'kindred ones', you know? The sort of books you can come back to again and again. Instead, what I got was a bad plotline, progressively unrealistic plot developments, and a cast of flat, lifeless, unpleasant characters to boot. Ender's Game, how I wish I had loved you. Why did you forsake me thus.did-not-likefictionsci-fi1,049 likes483 commentsLikeCommentMark LawrenceAuthor86 books54.4k followersSeptember 30, 2024I read this story decades back with no special expectations. Like most books I read it just happened to be lying around the house.I read it, was hugely entertained, and went on to read three or four of the sequels.I've heard since all manner of 'stuff' about the author but what's true and what isn't I don't know and I'm not here to critique the man behind the keyboard. All I can do is report on the contents of the book and those I can thoroughly recommend you check out.The main character, Ender Wiggin, through whose eyes we see the story unfold, is a child genius. If you're one of those people who wants your protagonist to be an average member of society, typical of his/her age and gender... step away. Ender's story is told because he is very far from ordinary.OSC employs a bunch of fairly standard story-telling tricks. Our hero is underestimated at every turn, he exceeds expectations, we know he's got it in him and we're frustrated by the stoopid people who just won't see it. There's a bully/nemesis and nobody else but us sees just how nasty he is... However, OSC manages to bake an irresistible cake using those standard ingredients and once he starts sprinkling on originality as well, you've just got to eat it all.This is sci-fi, not hard sci-fi, not soft sci-fi... let's say 'chewy'. It has a slightly old school EE Doc Smith feel to it, and you expect someone to pull out a monkey-wrench whenever the computer starts smoking, but none of that worried me.Given the date it was written there's some quite prescient stuff about the internet here, although shall we say ... optimistic ... about the ends to which it's put. Card foresaw rather more reasoned political/philosophical debate that swayed public opinion more effectively than rhetoric and demagoguery. And rather less hard core porn.Additionally the inclusion of female and Muslim characters whilst not front and centre was fairly progressive for 1985 (not ground breaking but certainly ahead of the curve).This is actually a book with good messages (for the time) about equality, and one which poses interesting philosophical questions about what happens when races with orthogonal thought processes come into contact, and how far one can or should go in such situations.There definitely is some characterisation going on. We're not talking Asimov's Foundation here where brilliant ideas invite you to forgive cardboard characters. The people here are decently drawn and Ender has his own angst (involving genius psychopathic siblings) that is quite engaging. However, it's the stuff that goes on that drives the story. The war games in preparation for battling the aliens, the unfortunately named 'Buggers'. These war games and Ender's brilliance in overcoming increasingly dire odds are a major theme and I loved them.And then there's the twist. I'll say no more on that except that I was too engaged with the story to see it coming, and when it hit me ... well, I'd give the book 6* just for that moment. It doesn't work for everyone but it did for me!EDIT: I have now seen the film - which I enjoyed. The film skips a lot that's important to the book, but I found it entertaining.EDIT 2: Orson Scott Card reviewed *my* first trilogy.

Technically, it's not a difficult read but conceptually it's rich and engaging.\"They have a word for people our age. They call us children and they treat us like mice.\"If you can't understand that statement, you probably won't like this book. It's about intelligent children. Not miniature adults- their motivations, understanding, and some-times naivete clearly mark them as children. But at the same time their intelligence and inner strength define them clearly aspeople. Their personalities are fully developed, even if their bodies are not.The book is about war. About leadership. And about the qualities that make some one a powerful or admirable individual (not always the same thing). In this book children are both kind and cruel to each other as only children know how to be. It is not an easy book for anyone who understands childhood to be a happy time of innocence. Even still, the characters retain a certain amount of innocence.The questions posed by the war, by the handling of the war, are relevant today, as they were when the book was written, and as they have been since the dawning of the atomic age. Foremost is the question of what makes someone or something a monster. It is an easy read, but not always a comfortable one.I'd recommend this book for intelligent children. The sort that resent being talked down to and treated like kids. Here is a book that does not talk down to them, but understands and empathizes with them. Also I recommend it for adults who used to be that kind of child, even if science fiction is not your usual interest. More pure science fiction fans will find it interesting, as will those who enjoy exploring the philosophies of human nature and war.This book sets out to make you think.classicsfavoritessci-fi-fantasy759 likes45 commentsLikeCommentHaley pham95 reviews197k followersSeptember 21, 2022Bruh604 likes12 commentsLikeCommentLisa of Troy801 reviews6,726 followersAugust 12, 2024In Orson Scott Card’s science-fiction novel Ender’s Game, we meet Ender Wiggins, a talented little boy who has the fate of the world on his shoulders.After an extensive period of monitoring, Ender attends a school for gifted children, training to learn the techniques to battle the buggers, an alien lifeform.When I started my career, I worked at an automotive company where I can only describe the environment as ideal. Our leader, we will call him King Arthur, was always looking out for his team. If you were only there for two weeks, he would come by your desk and let you know he thought of you for this amazing assignment.When lunch came around, the entire group would make eye contact and go down to lunch together. No one forced us. We genuinely enjoyed each other’s company. In fact, one gentleman even won the lottery and came back to work!Now, a few years later, I returned to work for this company. King Arthur had retired, and in his place was The Witch. The Witch required that you worked until 4 am. She would not work during the day (instead went to the gym) so she worked late at night, expecting everyone else to work the day and night. She would call meetings and then just never show up for them, wasting an entire roomful of people’s time without so much as an “I’m sorry.”If anything was wrong, The Witch would blame you. If the work product was great, The Witch took the credit for herself.So what makes these leaders? Open Ender’s Game.The brilliance of Ender’s Game is not necessarily the plot but the emotional intelligence and the symbolism. If you have worked in Corporate America, you know that life isn’t always fair. Some people are out to get you. But what can you say to motivate your team? Does your team need breaks to thrive? Open Ender’s Game.This book also brilliantly captured what it is like being at the top. Do you feel like quitting at times? You bet. Are things changing rapidly? Certainly.And Ender’s Game depicts how the most talented are also working harder than most. When Ender had secret techniques, he “told them freely, confident that few of them would know how to train their soldiers and toon leaders to duplicate what his could do.”Last, but certainly not least, the science fiction aspect of this book is a little unsettling. Portions of Ender’s Game were initially published in 1977. In the book, Ender and his team have a messaging system that sounds incredibly similar to today’s email or Team messaging.Overall, this book is well worth the read. I would say that it felt like a mashup of Dune and Ready Player One. Highly recommend.2025 Reading ScheduleJan A Town Like AliceFeb BirdsongMar Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr War and PeaceMay The Woman in WhiteJun AtonementJul The Shadow of the WindAug Jude the ObscureSep UlyssesOct Vanity FairNov A Fine BalanceDec GerminalConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeInstaMy Bookstore at Pango481 likes17 commentsLikeCommentCharly6 reviews9 followersAugust 25, 2007Spoiler Alert***God damn did I hate Ender’s Game. I checked out Amazon and can surely see why I wanted to give it a shot. Talk about a cult following of people absolutely smitten with it. I even read some where that it’s on the required reading list at Quantico. I suppose this book could be some kind of manifesto for misfit nerds who waste their life playing video games or a source of legitimacy for motivating tired Marines sick of drilling (The book rambles on infinitely about the boy genius Ender and his laser tag in a zero gravity vacuum.) I also suppose we could kid ourselves into thinking the novel brings to light the necessity of Machiavellianism in conflict or maybe we could discuss the pathetic New Age garbage the book ended with as our annoying protagonist spreads some half crocked neo-religion amongst space colonies in which you love the enemy you are forced to annihilate. Some sort of cryptic Latter Day Saints plug by the Mormon author?There were several other things I couldn’t stand about it. First of all, like even the best science fiction, the characters were one dimensional card board cut outs. This starts with the dorky, self absorbed protagonist Ender himself. I can deal with this problem if the plot is cool enough (ala Dune). Dune, too, often times dealt with children geniuses, however it was explained and made sense in the story. We have no idea why Ender and the other children (of which 99.9% were male) are so smart. Speaking of children, did any of you guys pick up any sort of creepy pedophile vibe in this book? How many times were we told of naked little boys? Why were there references to their tiny patches of pubic hair? Why did Ender have to have his big fight naked while lathered with soap in the shower? And the corny Ebonics that the children randomly spoke in? WTF?The third rate and minuscule insight we were given about the geopolitical conditions on Earth were terribly dated. The Warsaw Pact dominated by Russia? What a cheap rip of Orwell. Lame! The side story about Ender’s genius two siblings also using Machiavellian tactics to achieve their political goals (instead of Ender’s military ones) by blogging on the internet really didn’t add up to beans in plot development if you ask me. Of course, Ender is never beaten at anything he does. I suppose we are to be awed by his victories but, strangely, his greatest triumph was his stoic willingness to use some sort of super weapon to destroy an enemy wholesale via exploding an entire planet. On the cover of my book, it suggests this book is appropriate for 10 year olds. What could a child get out this book?

I should mention that I love science fiction, and have read it avidly since I was barely more than a child. I'm not by any means some kind of anti-sci-fi snob.The first thing that bothered me is that the novel sets adults against gifted children in a way that strikes me as bizarre. Adults are essentially evil but teachers especially. The children are inherently excellent, capable of helping each other in trying to figure out just what the adults are hiding, which is, in this case, a vast and secret war they are tricking the children into fighting for them. This was perhaps the hardest to believe of all the things thrown at the reader, and interestingly, it is hidden from you until the very end, though you can guess at it before then.What disturbed me the most is that the writing is terrible---far too much happens internally, inside the character's head--it's an emo space opera, basically--and one of the most interesting events of the book is nearly buried and the presentation of it is rushed, because it is near the end. There are many points in the battle scenes where it is impossible to understand what's happening. And the penultimate plot event, where it's revealed all of the games were not..games...could have been handled more interestingly. But the novel was overdetermined, things happening only because the writer wants them too and not because they feel inevitable, and so too many of the arrows point in the same direction. By the time Ender meets Mazer, his final teacher, my eyes rolled back into my head at the implausibility of it all.And it's worth mentioning the thing no one prepared me for was the bizarre homoerotic subtext built into the book as well, a subtext that is sometimes just a plain old supertext, on display, right beside how women in this novel are to be loved distantly and kept from real knowledge, and turned against themselves, so they can then be used to compel others.It creeped me out and I'm gay.I'm also a former 'gifted child', and was tested and poked and pushed, all of these things, made to study computer programming when I didn't want to, and I made myself fail out of their program to get away from them. But I found no commonality with the gifted children here, not as I have in other stories about gifted children, say, like Salinger's Glass family. Also, these kids are all jerks.I do hand it to Card for the ideas in the novel: blogging? Yes. It's in here, well before anyone was doing it, and it ...matters a lot, and in the ways blogging matters. Also the idea of an institution that runs on the manipulation of its populace into a distant war with an implacable foe, as a way of controlling people. And a society that has no privacy at all, not even in dreams. This novel does offer a dark picture of what life is like under these terms. Also, the idea of how a hive-mind would think differently, without language, and the complications of communicating with someone like that, that's brilliant also.I wish it had been revised--that the battle scenes were clearer, that the movement of the novel's action, the way the 'buggers' are in a race to try and communicate with Ender before he kills them, that this were more obvious to the reader, and not a surprise whipped out at the end, so that it could have lent tension to the scenes of the games and manipulation, which were only boring. And Ender's decision, to be the Speaker for the Dead, that struck me cold, because in the end, the buggers were only trying to do what everyone else in his life were doing to him: poring over what makes him tick and trying to get him to do their bidding.The novel contains a rant against style at the beginning, added by Card, called 'literary tricks' by him. I think the most interesting thing about it is that given the millions sold, it is proof that story matters more than style, even as convoluted and badly formed as this one is. In the end what matters is the questions the novel raises and the implications of the questions, and that the novel really is about something at its core, behind all of the badly rendered fight scenes. I admire style, don't get me wrong. I love it. But it would appear you can get by without it.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review313 likes58 commentsLikeCommentJ.G. Keely546 reviews11.6k followersAugust 26, 2016I was savaged by a miniature poodle the other day--wait--no, someone protested my review ofThe Giverthe other day. If you have any pent-up rage from that college lit teacher who forced you to think about books, be sure to stop by and spew some incoherent vitriol--my reviews are now a socially acceptable site of catharsis for the insecure.In any case, one of them made the argument that children need new versions of great books that are stupider, because children are just stupid versions of normal people. Happily-enough, The Giver is a totally stupid version ofA Clockwork Orangeor whatever Dystopian book (actually, it's a rewrite of Ayn Rand'sAnthem).Coincidentally, in my review ofAlice In Wonderland, I happen to put forth my own philosophy regarding children's books. In short: they should present a complex, strange, many-faceted, and never dumbed-down world, because presenting a simple, one-sided, dumbed-down world both insults and stultifies a child's mind.However, if someone were to say that this book were a childrenized version of Starship Troopers, I wouldn't sic a poodle on them. Both present a human/bug war, deal with the issues of death, war, the military complex, human interaction, personal growth, and all that good stuff.Also, both authors have their heads up their asses and there must be a pretty good echo in there since they keep yelling their hearts out about one personal opinion or another. However,Orson Scott Carddoesn't get into his pointless author surrogate diatribes until the second book in this series, so we may enjoy the first one uninterrupted.So it's a pretty good book for children, and like romeo and Juliet, it's easy to see the appeal: kid defeats bullies and plays videogames to save the world(in one of the sequels, they save the world by making angry comments on the internet--surprising that one isn't more popular here). But more than that, it's not a bad book in general, so I guess I don't have to bother defining it as dumbed-down, or 'for kids'. Then again, a lot of grown-ups seem like they need their books dumbed-down. Just look atThe Da Vinci Codecompared toThe Satanic Verses, orFoucault's Pendulum; or all three compared to TheIlluminatus Trilogy. I'm pretty sure when it comes to stupid versions of things, adults have the monopoly.americanovelreviewed...more290 likes68 commentsLikeCommentMatt19 reviews113 followersJanuary 31, 2008i think 'ender's game' is the only book i've read three times. for me books often don't have repeat reading value in the same way some movies have repeat viewing value. it's probably because a movie takes two hours of your time while a novel, for me, takes a week or longer. so for someone like to me read a novel twice, not to mention three times, is really saying something [and yes, i realize the inherent snobbery in that statement].i've thought long and hard about what makes 'ender's game' so appealing. it's got a sympathetic protagonist, lots of great action, lots of heart, and a plausible twist of an ending. on those merits only 'ender's game' works. it's a lot of fun to read and orson scott card manages to inject some really moral and ethical quandries without resorting to didactism or heavy-handedness. for example, the manipulations of the battle school powers-that-be are presented and inspected, but card never explicitly paints them as the enemy. they are who they are, for better or for worse, but it's up to the reader to for his or her own opinions. same for ender and his merry band of castoffs. card understands that good v. bad is never as simple as black v. white. the world and universe are, more often than not, varying shades of gray. and the folks who inhabit that gray universe, for better or for worse, are who they are. they all have a part, they all have a purpose--even if those parts and purposes contradict each other.'ender's game' is also a great story of the value and importance of friendship. i choke up everytime ender's friends great him over the headset and the kids prepare for the final 'battle.' who wouldn't want friends like bean, petra, hot soup and the rest? i sure would.but i think the real appeal for 'ender's game' comes from the belief that we all want to believe that there's something uniquely special about us. i think it's safe to assume that most of us have, at one point or another, felt like the underdog, the castoff, the misfit, the misunderstood, or the underappreciated, and that if people would just give us a chance, we'd shine. in that way ender is very much a universal character. he embodies a small part of each ous. yes, he is treated unfairly and manipulated, but he's also the smartest kid in the room. there's something very appealing about that. at least there is for me. whether or not i'm the smartest person in the room is irrelevant, but i want to believe it. and whenever i read 'ender's game' there's a small hope that it just might be true.263 likesLikeCommentJohn WiswellAuthor49 books692 followersFebruary 24, 2012This is a novel that blows past conventional ideas like \"disbelief.\" Apparently humanity, a species whose only real claim to fame is war, now stinks at war, and can only be saved by a child genius who is one part prophecy, one part bad science, and one part wish-fulfillment. Thanks to this plan, we are treated to a gaggle of super-intelligent children who seldom appear particularly clever (in fact many behave with adult maturity rather than abnormal intellect) and achieve greatness not through any great effort that we follow (rather you'll read recaps of their successful efforts), but because the author wants them to achieve these things. In this, the definitive edition ofEnder's Game, there is almost nothing earned within the plot.It's a decent story, but for a book with so many events there is very little consequence or risk, and the character development is so linear and stale. That last quality is particularly cloying considering that, prodigies or not, most of the characters are children and at least one of them should develop in an unexpected way. Instead the unexpected developments we get are humorlessly absurd, like two prodigies fooling the world with a fake op-ed column that earns them political power. The ending is predictable and deliberately anti-climactic, robbing the novel of its one true punch. The trade-off is, instead of getting the thing the book was building to, you get the opportunity for sequels and spin-offs. If you liked the infallible, mostly emotionless and paper-thin protagonist, then that's a good thing. If you were hoping to have the hours you put into the book validated with some real emotion at the end, well, neither this author's definitive edition nor any other is going to help you.210 likes28 commentsLikeCommentAhmad Sharabiani9,563 reviews540 followersSeptember 14, 2021Ender's Game (The Ender Quintet #1), Orson Scott CardEnder's Game is a 1985 military science fiction novel by American author Orson Scott Card.

BECAUSE I WAS STUPID, THAT IS WHY.My stupidity aside, I hope you guys will still consider this 5-star review to be credible and valid. I'll list off the pros and cons to this novel and you can decide.Pros:An adorable main character.Ender (Andrew) Wiggins was a breath of fresh air from the strong heroine of YA literature. Being a 6 year old at the beginning of the novel, I was completely caught off guard by his maturity and how sneaky he was.The tactics used in the Game.The reason the Hunger Games was interesting to me were solely due to the tactics Katniss used to stay alive, Well, guess what? Ender Wiggins just pretty much kick this Katniss chick's butt. Ender almost reminded me of Alexander the Great or Napoleon and I LOVED IT.Oh the perceptive of Valentine and Peter was also very fascinating. The political backdrop highlighted by Demosthenes and Locke was very refreshing for a science student like me.Now, I shall move on to thecons:The lack of romance.OMG WHO AM I SUPPOSE TO SHIP NOW? NO DARK, MYSTERIOUS BOY WHO THE MAIN CHARACTER CAN FEEL SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED FOR.Haha, just kidding. I am glad the focus was on Ender and his growth to his maximum potential. The lack of romantic development is one of the best thing about this novel. I find romance takes away from such a masterpiece.Just to be clear, there are no cons to this book.

Ender's Game is set in a disarmingly straightfoward sci-fi setting: a near future earth threatened by a hostile alien species with superior technology that seems determined to destroy the human race. The story centers on a young boy who is drafted into an all-consuming military training program at the age of 6. The program he's inducted into seeks to forge a new generation of military commanders out of gifted children, and it's sole purpose is to break them at any cost, until they finally discover someone who can't be broken. What follows is an emotionally complex and at times painfully familiar story of children struggling to accept their inner demons. Ender in particular is cursed with a brutal combination of profound empathy for others, and an overwhelming survival instinct that drives him to win no matter what the cost. It is this combination of gifts that may make him the commander the fleet needs in it's war against the alien invaders, but only if Ender can find a way to survive the burden of understanding his enemy so thoroughly that he can no longer see them as \"the other,\" but as a reflection of himself.The story is fast-paced, and Card's signature style of simple, plain language and streamlined descriptiveness serves to bring the characters front and center at all times. This book is infused with a very real sense of psychological and spiritual dislocation, and treats it's young protagonists as fully realized, intelligent, 3 dimensional characters struggling with very adult questions. Card's other signature: creating drama through ethical dilemmas, is also a central element of the story, and he does a very good job of challenging the reader to find some semblance of moral high ground anywhere. The conflicts between characters are made all the more powerful by the almost total lack of mystery: motivations and intent are laid out very clearly in most cases, and it is the reader's ability to empathize with everyone's point of view that makes the story less about winning and loosing and more about living with the consequences of either.This book is thought provoking, emotionally complex, and ethically challenging. It's a powerful examination of conflict and violence, military necessity, family roles, and the ways in which we use the idea of \"the other\" to justify all manner of savagery.169 likes7 commentsLikeCommentRebecca Watson54 reviewsMay 3, 2013Once upon a time, there was a tiny 6-year old boy who all the other kids picked on. Little did they know that he was very special and all the adults secretly loved him even though they didn't stop anyone from picking on him, and also he knew karate and he didn't want to hurt them but he would if he had to, and it just so happens that he has to. Often. Also he spoke and thought not like a 6-year old boy but as a smug 30-year old man with a fair amount of unresolved bitterness toward his childhood.I finished this book very quickly, not because I am a misunderstood supergenius toddler, but because if I lost any momentum at all, I'd put this book down and never again be able to screw up the energy to deal with the pretentious little prick known as Ender Wiggin.I really wanted to like the book. The basic outline of the story is fine and even appealing to me: kids being trained with video games from an early age to join a war effort. But the writing was, at times, excruciating. To be fair, had I read it when I was a (fairly average, I'm sure) 12-year old, I probably would have found it more enjoyable. But as an (average, again) adult, I found it to be about 100 pages too long and filled with long passages during which I developed a loathing of the main character at precisely the moment when the author clearly wanted me to admire his cleverness, strength of character, and bold moral wrestling. \"Ooh, how deftly he wins the admiration of his peers by suggesting that bully is gay! Aah, the psychological pain he endures at being the best at strategy and physical combat! Oh, the bravery of joking with the black boy about how he's a n****r! Oh why can't he find a teacher who can teach him something he doesn't already know!\"I was also continuously distracted by sentences like, \"They pushed his face backward into the door.\" What does that mean? If they're pushing his face backward, does that mean his head hit the door? His face can't hit the door if it's not facing it.Anyway. The final act started off well enough and brought everything to a satisfactory conclusion, and then the book continued on for another 25 pages that should be considered by nerds to be as unconscionable as the final episode of Battlestar Gallactica, where all reason and logic are dispensed with in favor of some weird fantasy that pretends to wrap up everything in a nice and neat bow.It's interesting to compare this to Dune, which I read last month. Dune does a similar thing (young adult-style writing about a young boy with great powers who will save the world) but does it without making the main character insufferable. Unlike Dune, I don't think I'll bother reading any other books about Ender, the universe's tiniest supergenius.read-in-2013166 likes31 commentsLikeCommentkaren4,006 reviews172k followersOctober 1, 2019ender's gameis pretty awesome, when it's not being boring.and of course it is just me - in class yesterday the parts i mentioned as being boring TO ME were other people's favorite parts. and this is all due to a design flaw in me: i am physically incapable of visualizing action sequences. in movies, they make it so easy. in books, i frequently have to reread scenes a few times before i can orient myself. throw in zero gravity and weapons that don't actually exist, and i am loster than lost.but - the parts of this that are good (to me) were very very good. why have i never read this before?? because i thought it was a total little boy book - all outer space and video games. and it is. but it is also about the formative years of a military savant - pushed nearly beyond his endurance into this pit of loneliness and pure strategy and honed into a killing machine. usually i hate precocity, but this was just brilliant. i liked so many of the characters, i loved watching ender progress, i just loved every minute of it. and even the parts i couldn't wrap dumbhead around, they were still fast-paced, even though i couldn't understand \"wait, so who is hiding behind the star?? and who has been flashed? and what does that cord attach to??\"and of course, all that it has to say about the role of ethics on the military and about the suppression of the individual in these circumstances is gorgeous.and if you like this book, be sure to check out o.s.c's many review of snacks and other sundries:this one is pretty informativei am sorry this review is crap, but i am supposed to be studying for a midterm. plus, almost everyone has already read this, so it's not like i am discovering anything here.come to my blog!and-so-this-is-grad-school154 likes62 commentsLikeCommentJoel565 reviews1,879 followersNovember 30, 2010Lots of people have already read this book, and it's pretty much universally acclaimed, so it probably doesn't really need another review.

The entire time Ender is at Battle School, Card constantly tells us how everyone is always sleeping naked, or walking around the barracks naked orjoggingnaked. And one of the major fight sequences happens in the shower, and Ender's opponent strips down beforehand so they can both be naked. And did I mention that the genders are mixed (if mostly male) and the oldest character in the book is 12?I don't know, maybe it's just me. It's not like I'm offended, it's just odd and a little distracting. Don't kids have shame in the future?This review brought to you by the word \"naked.\"------------------------------------------------Oh and I also meant to put in something about how this book predicted so much of the way politics and the internet would evolve and intertwine, and the emergence of blogging as a platform where any one person can rise to international attention through a democratized communications forum.

I can work up some interest for these things, but there has to be some characters I care about. However, how exactly am I supposed to find compassion for a boy who goes from one task to another never failing and always being the best at EVERYTHING, and not because he works hard to achieve his greatness, but because he was genetically engineered to be the best? Where is the conflict and character growth here I wonder? And then the kids. I wish even one of the characters actually acted like a kid, or a human being at least. I personally only saw cardboard in every direction.I suppose there are some interesting ideas about military training, manipulation, and leadership, but I admit, I mostly found myself bored to death by numerous battles, which I couldn't visualize, and it's-so-hard-to-be-the-bestest-ever-genius whining.Listening to the author's speech at the end of my audio book didn't endear me to him personally either. He is just not a very sophisticated person, but he surely knows his audience of prepubescent boys and gamers well. Plus I have very little respect for writers who create not because they have something important to say about our society and human condition, but because they are paid 5 cents per word to do it.I think I will stick withUrsula K. Le Guinfor now, whenever I am in a mood for some alien action, and resign myself to the fact thatEnder's Game's cult classic status is something I will never be able to understand.P.S. I did have a blast reading reviews about the author's obsession with naked, soap-lathered little boys. How they came up with this pedohomoerotic BS, I have no idea. Did we read the same book?P.P.S.

(and I wasn't mistaken about that)And commenting about the shock made for the book, it's obvious that it's provoked due that the protagonist is a child.This very same story using an adult, even a young adult, and this book wouldn't impress anybody.HOW MUCH TIME CHILDREN REMAIN AS CHILDREN NOWADAYS?However I think that establishing that this is a story set into the future of humankind, I think that how the children think, talk and act here is not far-fetched.Maybe in 1985 could be......, but now?Now, children have all the access to internet just like this \"futuristic\" story sets, and now kids got \"mature\" very quickly, not a real maturity per se, but the exposure to so much information in the web and the interaction on social networks, forums, blogs, etc... make them to \"act like adults\" before their time and also it make them to lose sensibility on how treating living things.So, that angle is very visionary. No doubt about it, and maybe because of that, the book will remain as something relevant to read not matter if we enjoyed the reading or not of it.A BATTLE SCHOOL SHOULD BE STILL A SCHOOL?Now, the development.I found odd that in his life on Battle School, you only get the practices and exercises, and you only read about how Ender learn from his peers and never from the teachers, it's supposed to be a school but you never see how are \"classes\" there.It's like if he wouldn't get any valuable education from adult teachers.The book was really interesting while Ender was still very young but as soon he got a promotion to commander, I think that much of the \"spark\" of the narrative was lost.TO BUG OR NOT TO BUGIt's kind of a rule on these military sci-fi stories that they have to battle against insect-like species?Like onStarship Troopers. I guess that it's easier to get a lot of killing without provoking so much social shock. I am sure that when Peter did some awful things to one single squirrel disturbed a lot of people, me included, but killing insects?If a kid kills an animal, it's a sure signal that they have a psychopath on their hands, but killing a cockroach? An ant? A wasp? Unless you are a monk in Tibet, you have kill an infinite quantity of insects on your life and you didn't think twice about it again.So, the easiest way to make people confortable with massive killing is convincing them that they are not killing sentient life forms but dang bugs.And, yes, that not only works here, in this book, but in many dark moments in our history.dystopiamilitarynovel...more137 likes23 commentsLikeCommentBradleyAuthor5 books4,586 followersFebruary 18, 2022Re-Read 2/18/22:This must be my 6th time reading this and I cried like a baby at certain parts all over again as if it was my first.More importantly, I read it with my daughter, so it WAS her first time.Say what you will about the author, he wrote a fantastically empathetic book that works on so many damn levels.

I suppose I can point to this book as being one of the very first to open my eyes to just how much can be accomplished in SF.I mean, sure, I first read Chriton's Sphere right after King's Tommyknockers so I was feeling the love already, but Ender's Game set a new standard in readability, emotional impact, and sheer cussed F***ed-up-ness.Since then, I've read over twenty novels that shared echoes of this novel. And yet, I keep coming back to this and its companion, Speaker for the Dead, glorying in the wonder of all these little pieces coming together in plots both interesting, tragic, and wonderful.This is one of those rare cases where popularity is not unfounded. A great tale meets great acclaim.I can rank this up near Dune as one of my most beloved novels of all time. No question about it.Do I pity Ender? Hell, yes.

Sólo el enemigo te enseña sus puntos fuertes. Y las únicas reglas del juego son qué puedes hacerle y qué puedes impedir que él te haga.”Este tiene que ser, sin duda, uno de los mejores libros de ciencia ficción escritos. El juego de Ender, es un libro que lees del tirón, ágil y muy bien escrito. Está ambientado en un escenario de ciencia ficción digamos algo sencillo, nada complejo. Una tierra del futuro amenazada por una especie alienígena hostil con una tecnología superior que parece decidida a destruir la raza humana.La historia se centra en un niño, Ender, que es reclutado en un programa de entrenamiento militar que lo consume todo a la edad de nada menos que 6 años. Este programa busca forjar una nueva, dura y muy superior generación de comandantes militares a partir de estos niños superdotados, y su único propósito es romperles a cualquier precio, con el propósito de descubrir a aquellos que no se puede romper.Su protagonista, Ender Wiggin, tiene solo seis años al comienzo de la novela y todavía es un preadolescente cuando termina la historia. Los padres de Ender han recibido un permiso especial para tener un tercer hijo a pesar de las estrictas leyes de control de la población en la sociedad en la que viven. Sus brillantes hermanos mayores, Peter y Valentine, tienen todo tipo de promesas, pero aún no tienen lo que se necesita para ser considerados como el comandante que la Flota Internacional necesita tan desesperadamente.La novela plantea una pregunta importante: ¿Qué se necesita para llevar con éxito a los hombres/niños a la batalla? La batalla se nos presenta en forma de invasiones alienígenas. Durante la última invasión que tuvo lugar, la humanidad sobrevivió gracias a la brillantez de Mazer Rackham, el comandante de la Flota Internacional.Años más tarde, se teme una tercera invasión y el I.F. cree que Ender puede ser el comandante que necesitan. Esperan que pueda llevarlos a la victoria en caso de que los \"insectores\" vuelvan a invadir la Tierra.“Pero como los adultos siempre decían lo mismo cuando algo iba a doler, podía considerar esa afirmación como una predicción exacta del futuro. Algunas veces las mentiras eran más de fiar que las verdades.”Lo que sigue es una historia emocionalmente compleja y en ocasiones dolorosamente familiar de niños que luchan por aceptar sus demonios internos. Ender, en particular, es el que más destaca, una combinación brutal de profunda empatía por los demás y un abrumador instinto de supervivencia que lo impulsa a ganar sin importar el costo. Es esta combinación de dones que pueden convertirlo en el comandante que la flota necesita en su guerra contra los invasores alienígenas, pero solo si Ender puede encontrar una manera de comprender a su enemigo tan a fondo que ya no pueda verlos como, el otro bando, sino como un reflejo de sí mismo.La historia es vertiginosa, y el estilo de Card me gustó, un lenguaje sencillo y una descripción simplificada que sirve para llevar a todos los personajes al frente y al centro de la historia en todo momento. Card trata a sus muy jóvenes protagonistas como personajes tridimensionales inteligentes y ya plenamente realizados que luchan con preguntas muy adultas.La otra firma de Card es crear drama a través de varios dilemas éticos, esto también es un elemento central de la historia, y hace un muy buen trabajo al desafiar al lector a encontrar algo parecido a un terreno moral elevado en cualquier lugar. Los conflictos entre personajes se vuelven aún más poderosos por la casi total falta de misterio, pues las motivaciones y la intención se presentan con mucha claridad en la mayoría de los casos, y es la capacidad del lector para empatizar con el punto de vista de todos lo que hace que la historia sea menos sobre ganar o perder y más sobre vivir con las consecuencias de cualquier resultado.“La humanidad no nos pide que seamos felices. Sólo nos pide ser brillantes en su nombre.”Este libro me sorprendió y muchísimo, lo admito es estimulante, emocionalmente muy complejo y éticamente desafiante. Es un examen poderoso del conflicto y la violencia, la necesidad militar, los roles familiares y las formas en que usamos la idea del \"otro\" para justificar todo tipo de salvajismo. Por cierto, la película vamos es que no le llega al libro ni usando microscopio. Este libro y mira que ya llevo unas cuantas joyas de la CF, clásica, los mejores para mí. Este ocupa un lugar al lado de, Flores para Algernon.El libro es mucho mejor que la película. Sé que probablemente hayáis leído esta frase y otras en muchas reseñas. No puedo llegar a expresar completamente todo lo que ha sido la exquisita lectura de, El juego de Ender. Es que no puedo encontrar un solo defecto. Todo perfectamente escrito y construido.\"Sólo hay una cosa que hará que dejen de odiarte. Y esa cosa es ser tan bueno en todo lo que hagas que no puedan ignorarte.\"El desarrollo de los personajes en el libro es realmente asombroso. Realmente no se parece en nada a la forma en que la película presentó a los personajes. Todos se sentían importantes y su transformación tuvo un gran impacto para mí. Personajes como, Valentine y Peter estaban muy establecidos, y su viaje cuando eran niños fue algo diferente, completamente interesante y divertido al mismo tiempo. La película creo que ni mostró que ambos se convirtieron en Demóstenes y Locke. Esa parte de su historia realmente me asombró. Este libro mostró que la edad no importa para marcar la diferencia. Se trata de niños y niñas que muestran un enorme coraje y además absoluto conocimiento. No me agradaba nada Peter en el sentido moral, pero su violencia e intimidación creo que llevaron al crecimiento positivo de Ender y Valentine. Y si afectó a Ender de mala manera, pero si luego observamos el cambio general que emanaba Ender, es notable cómo la violencia condujo al éxito. Creo que el autor fue demasiado duro con sus personajes, demasiado duro pero es esto precisamente lo que más destaca del libro y en el buen sentido. La trama es interesante y da varios giros, destacando sobretodo el final y el enorme desarrollo de los personajes, ahí fueron increíbles. Muy bien escrito y está todo pensado para impactar al lector. Es algo original para mí al menos y asombroso.\"Podría matarte así, susurró Peter. Solo presiona y presiona hasta que estés muerto\"Escuela de Batalla, donde los niños brillantes son entrenados en estrategia y duras tácticas militares. Ender está aislado, es ridiculizado, intimidado y prácticamente perseguido. Pero es decidido y muestra los medios para sobrevivir e incluso prosperar y evolucionar en esas difíciles circunstancias. Su asombrosa inteligencia, con la que el niño aprende a ser un líder y a actuar con la venganza de un soldado. Su juventud y pequeña estatura no logran detenerlo, y Ender asciende rápidamente. Ender tiene solo 12 años cuando comienza a comandar a sus compañeros soldados, ganándose así su respeto y, en última instancia, su miedo hacia él. Todo termina en sorpresas.La pieza central de su educación es un juego que simula una batalla. Ender es muy bueno en este juego, y esta es la razón principal por la que se convierte en el comandante más joven de la historia. De todos modos, la vida de Ender en la escuela y los diversos juegos, pruebas y tribulaciones en las que sobresale ya no solo están maravillosamente escritos sino que es una gozada ir leyendo todo lo que pasa, creando en el lector una necesidad de querer ver como evoluciona en concreto el personaje de Ender y como termina su dura preparación. Es un libro impresionante, en todos los niveles. Impresionante e imprescindible.“Los seres humanos son libres, excepto cuando la humanidad los necesita. A lo mejor la humanidad te necesita. Para hacer algo. Creo que la humanidad me necesita a mí para averiguar para qué sirves. Los dos podemos hacer cosas despreciables, Ender; pero si la humanidad sobrevive, habremos sido buenos instrumentos.”114 likes57 commentsLikeCommentBecky1,504 reviews1,879 followersAugust 7, 2013Ugh. Okay. I'm officially giving up on this one.So, a little disclaimer here. I do not like Orson Scott Card. As a person. I think he's a shitty human who's used his award-winning author status as a platform to advocate the denial of other humans' rights. This is detestable to me.But that is not why I rated this book 1 star.The reason I gave this book 1 star, and have given up even trying to read it, is because I do not like Orson Scott Card. As an author. This was the second book of his I've read - or tried to read- and it will most assuredly be my last. I finished the other one, but can't say I liked it, though it was... interesting. This one I just couldn't even muster up any meh over, and it's supposedly his best work. I disliked it almost immediately.I made it about 15%, and I've read about all I can stands, I can't stands no more.The writing is awful. We're told what Ender thinks. We're told what Ender feels, and does, and says, and why, and despite supposedly being in his head, I don't understand or like him at all. We're told he's a genius. We're told he's mastered calculus as a toddler, that he can hack school computers with ease. We're told that he plays game A. Then he beats it, and plays game B. In every game, the goal is conquer and kill, and he's the best at it. But we're told that Ender does that only when he's forced... but then we're told that he likes it - no he doesn't! - yes he does. He stabs the game giant in the eye and likes it, and then when the giant is 'dead' and no longer an obstacle, out of boredom, he wishes he could murder it again. Because he liked it. That's why he's The One. Duh.The ridiculous chapter-leading nameless dialogues are terrible and jarring and distracting, and they take me out of the story. Which is a very bad thing when I'm disliking and uninterested in the story as it is.The complete lack of characterization is shameful. These kids, and especially Ender, who is SIX YEARS OLD and likes to throw the N-word around like it's a frisbee, sound like adults that I wouldn't even want to talk to, let alone root for. I don't like, understand, or care about a single character in this book. Not one. Wait, I might like the Buggers, but that's only because I feel like they have to be decent if they want to rid the universe of this society of sociopaths and groomed killer children.Then there's the fact that I'm apparently supposed to believe that a society as advanced as this one, with space travel, in-body monitoring of thoughts and actions of their potential recruits, the ability to at least partially coax out genius children by specialized breeding, etc, would be so casually dismissive of female potential as to respond to a question regarding whether there will be girls at this murder-camp with\"A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them.\"Because, apparently, only Y chromosomes can carry intelligence and females are just sub-par, even at evolution. How can they be a war leader and savior of humanity if they can't even master upward evolution, like males have?Oh, but wait... which entry tests were those again? The ones that require extreme violence? Stomping the shit out of another kid, albeit a bully, was the only test-like thing I saw that earned Ender a spot at murder-school. And it's OKAY that Ender put him in the hospital, because he was forced to do it or keep being bullied. There was no other solution. So maybe that little comment was a backhanded compliment to us of the gentler, weaker sex. Our delicate sensibilities just don't automatically run to murderdeathkill at the slightest provocation, which from what I can tell makes females completely valueless except as future-soldier-makers, so yeah, I guess we fail. Darn!I don't buy the concept of putting all of the eggs of an apparently critically endangered humanity into a single basket that consists of a child 4 years away from attaining the glorious achievement of double digit age. But wait, this war is apparently on hold while this generation of future soldiers grows up? How awesomely considerate of the \"Buggers\". I now see why they must die. /sarcasmWhich brings me to the \"Buggers\". They are aliens. Got that. Apparently, there's no possibility of aliens NOT wanting to wipe out all of humanity... because, you know, the universe isn't big enough for the both of us. I was really, really hoping for a plausible reason why these aliens would want to kill people, but I got nada. Perhaps it's explained later. Or maybe this is just fear and hatred of the unknown. I don't know, and frankly don't care all that much, but it just feels like we're supposed to just go along with the story that implies that different = bad and must be killed.I'm not squeamish or tender-hearted. I fully believe in killing off characters that need to die, even and especially if it's painful to the reader. Violence, in general, doesn't bother me, and I have no trouble reading about abuse, or death, or destruction, or brutality. But it needs to have a purpose and reason for existing on the page. It needs to be honest, and realistic, and plausible. And I didn't feel like that was the case here. It felt like it was for pure shock value here, placed with ever more aggressive offensiveness with the hopes of a reaction. \"OMG! they are just babies! Oh the brutality! Won't someone save the children?!\" And it worked, because my reaction is to stop reading this shit called a book. The racism, misogyny, hatred of the 'different', the adult condoned and encouraged cruelty and alienation of weaker or smaller children, the violence and genocidal-tendencies in a6 year oldall made me hate every minute I spent reading, or avoiding, this book, and only confirmed that Orson Scott Card is not someone whose work I will ever read or watch again.I could go on, but I'm done with this book. Writing it off and washing my hands because they feel like they've been holding something disgusting and slimy. I haven't seen anything even remotely redeeming in this book, nothing that makes me think that the rest of it would be worth my time, and I'm done.classicsdisappointingdnf...more113 likes134 commentsLikeCommentHenry Avila518 reviews3,323 followersAugust 29, 2023In the not too distant future, Earth desperately needs help, hideous aliens called disparagingly \"buggers\" by the inhabitants...(they do look like bugs but with brains ) on the third planet of the Solar System because we were twice attacked brutally, killing countless from an unknown region of the galaxy...another will probably be fatal unless a Caesar, Alexander or Napoleon can be found, however this type of leader is hard to discover.

Weightless in parts of the structure for training purposes in the Battle School, still different rooms have gravity because of the spinning wheel. At first fun games but quickly becomes drudgery, the tedious exercises. Colonel Graff in charge here apparently likes to inflict pain, is merciless to everyone and Ender in particular. Major Anderson second-in-command wants to moderate his superior officer but is sadly unsuccessful .The boy misses his sister the only person he really loves , his older scary brother hates him and the feeling is mutual. Year after year with no end in sight the child grows older but happiness will never arrive just suffering and his few friends adroit Alai, little Bean, Petras, very able and only girl in his army, seems an illusion... Day by day he becomes weaker in spirit... hope , a word for others to believe but Ender must believe otherwise ... The struggles will be great the rewards might be too. The novel is quite original in its plot and the main character gives a unique insight into the adolescent mind, though young he is quite perceptive. A sci-fi novel for adults.111 likes11 commentsLikeCommentJ.L. Sutton666 reviews1,187 followersFebruary 5, 2021“Humanity does not ask us to be happy.

This means I already had a take on how things went down at Battle School (and that was from Bean’s rather than Ender’s perspective). That said, I wholeheartedly recommend Ender’s Game not because I think it’s better than Ender’s Shadow (I don’t), but because Ender’s Saga is fantastic (especially the next two books in the series, Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide). The premise of Ender’s Game is interesting (training the brightest minds to fight the war against mankind’s greatest enemy); however, it’s just as interesting to look at the social and cultural changes on Earth. For that, we have the perspective of Ender’s two siblings, Peter and Valentine. I think they are sometimes overlooked, but they are great characters. Overall, I found Ender’s Game to be a fun and entertaining read!98 likesLikeCommentJesse157 reviews69 followersAugust 2, 2023If history has taught us anything, its that no one turns out for the better when the government experiments on them.

Ender’s Game for me represents the loneliness of childhood when you’re different. I first read this book when I was 9 years old and just starting the 4th grade. I was the only kid in my small class in the Gifted program at that point, which set me apart. I was an odd child, athletically challenged and socially inept and physically awkward. I had teeth too big for my head, ears too far large for my face, and hair that pencils could get lost in. My only true friends at this stage in my life were family members and books.“Because never in my entire childhood did I feel like a child. I felt like a person all along―the same person that I am today.”So when I came across Ender’s Shadow and Ender’s Game, I felt understood (by someone unrelated to me) for the first time in my life. Here were kids who were different, who were often hated and belittled by other children because of those differences, but who discovered that those differences were actually their strengths. That was an incredibly inspirational possibility that I clung to for years after reading the books for the first time, and that I still cling to when I feel like I don’t fit in somewhere.“I think it's impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves.”My copy of this book is tattered. Pieces of the cover are missing. The spine is broken. The pages are yellow. And I won’t trade it for a newer copy until it falls completely to pieces. I just read this book for the 8th time. I read it in elementary and junior high and high school, once every couple of years, just to remind myself that what made me weird could make me strong. I read it in college when I got married younger than most people and wasn’t living on campus, and was viewed as an odd duck by my classmates. I pushed it into the hands of kids I could see myself in when I became a teacher.“Humanity does not ask us to be happy. It merely asks us to be brilliant on its behalf.”I lead a small monthly bookclub for teenagers at my local library, and was thrilled when they chose Ender’s Game as October’s book. I hadn’t read it in about five years, so I was a bit nervous that it wouldn’t hold up to yet another reread, but I dove in anyway. Never have I been happier to be wrong. This book packs just as much punch for me 19 years later as it did the first time I cracked it open.“Perhaps it's impossible to wear an identity without becoming what you pretend to be.”Ender Wiggin is a genius, wise beyond his years, and he is thrust into impossible situation after impossible situation. Adults are the enemy, seeking to isolate him and push him to his breaking point. But he will not be broken. He adapts and overcomes, making friends in spite of the establishment’s best efforts. However, a time comes when he has to put the mission above his relationships, and has to stand alone. His empathy and drive and monstrous intellect are awe-inspiring, but are they enough to keep him from finally shattering beneath a weight too large for his small shoulders to bear?“There are times when the world is rearranging itself, and at times like that, the right words can change the world.”This is not a children’s book, but never in my childhood did I read another book that I related to more than this one and Ender’s Shadow. I honestly feel that this book is appropriate for all ages. If you know anyone who is different, who just can’t seem to become part of the crowd and always seems to stand out and stand alone, please find a way to get this book into their hands. Be they child or adult, this book will make them feel less alone. And if you yourself are different, if you march to the beat of your own drum even when the world demands your silence, read this book and feel understood.Original review can be found atBooknest.best-books-i-ve-ever-readchildrens-booksclassics-i-ve-read...more89 likes19 commentsLikeCommentBlaine904 reviews1,053 followersJanuary 30, 2024I decided to rereadEnder’s Gamebefore tackling the rest of the series. My feelings about it are more complicated than on my first reading. There’s some religious stereotyping and homophobia that haven’t aged well at all. And there’s not just an absence of women in the story. Women are actively disrespected by the men, who explain their almost total lack of representation by stating “too many centuries of evolution are working against them.” Gross.Ender Wiggin, however, remains a fascinating character. His calculated use of violence—winning one fight to prevent all other fights—is both logical and chilling. He is believable as a potential Napoleon, even if his consistent positioning as a form of Goldilocks between his hyper-violent brother Peter and his pacifist sister Valentine is a bit too convenient.The story, moreover, remains a really interesting exploration of certain philosophies, as well as interpersonal and military strategies:There is no teacher but the enemy. No one but the enemy will tell you what the enemy is going to do. No one but the enemy will ever teach you how to destroy and conquer. Only the enemy shows you where you are weak. Only the enemy tells you where he is strong.In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them.... I destroy them.There is quite a bit of subtle foreshadowing that is apparent on a reread: “The adults are the enemy, not the other armies. They do not tell us the truth.” Still, even knowing the ending does not dilute the story’s power, or its anti-war message.Ender’s Gameis not a perfect book, but even if some of its views are regressive, many are not. Above all, it is an entertaining read, for young and old. Highly recommended.P.S. When asked the difference between science fiction and fantasy, Mr. Card once said you can forget all the other explanations you hear. The difference is “science fiction has rivets; fantasy has trees.” A perfect explanation that I wanted to preserve for posterity, and this review was as good a place as any.Buddy read with Meg (2024).201320192024...more92 likes2 commentsLikeCommentWill M.327 reviews659 followersFebruary 1, 2015I can't believe it took me forever to finally read this. I chose to watch the movie first last year, because I remember not having the physical copy of the book yet. That was the biggest mistake of my reading life.The book is way better than the movie. I know you've probably seen that phrase a million times, but I can't fully express how it truly applies to Ender's Game. I can't find a flaw even if I wanted to. Everything seems perfectly written and constructed. I'm going to be honest and say that I hated most of the overhyped books here on goodreads, but the hype that Ender's Game received's truly deserving. It lived up to my expectations, and continued to amaze me as every page went by.The character development in this novel's truly astounding. It's really nothing like the way the movie introduced the characters. Everyone in the novel felt important, and their transformation had a huge impact to me. Valentine and Peter were both very much established, and their life journey [as children] was somewhat different, but completely interesting and amusing at the same time. If I remember correctly, the movie didn't even show that both of thembecameDemosthenes and Locke. That part of their story truly amazed me. This novel showed that age doesn't matter in making a difference. It's all about courage and knowledge to truly express what's inside your head. I didn't like Peter in the moral sense, but his violence and bullying led to Ender and Valentine's positive growth. It may have affected Ender in a bad way, but if you look at the overall change that Ender exuded, it's remarkable how violence led to success.I think I'm going to retract my statement that I can't think of any flaws. I believe the author was too harsh with his characters, too harsh in a sense that it became a bit unbelievable. Unbelievable in the sense that I haven't really encountered a child who was pushed too much that he's capable of murder. I'm not talking about Ender, because despite everything he did, his humanity was still very much evident. I'm talking about Bonzo. How could he be capable of murder, and not have any guilt afterwards. If the author presented a violent past, then maybe I could still digest the fact that he becameevil, but he was just evil like that. He expressed his anger by raging on Ender, without a concrete and well-explained reason why. That's the onlyproblemI could think of, and it's not even really a problem to be honest. It's so minor that the magnificence of the novel can easily cover up this personal opinion of mine. It's not even bothering me, I just wanted to present a slight flaw so that this review wouldn't seem to kiss the novel's ass so much, even though I think it is.I've lived too long with pain. I won't know who I am without itYeah, that line in the near end says it all. Ender's a changed man, call me sadistic, but I believe it changed him for the better. He's become the strong young man he's supposed to be.The plot and character development were both amazing, as I repeat. It's original [for me at least] and the ending truly depicts that the author's not done trying to destroy Ender's humanity. I can't wait to read the succeeding novels, even the Shadow series after. This series made it to my top favorite, alongside A Song of Ice and Fire, or maybe I could just say that this is my favorite Sci-Fi book, and possibly series. If you really read the review, then it's obvious that I'm giving this the highest possible recommendation to anyone. The hype might make you cautious, but seriously, this is novel is amazing.5/5 stars, truly remarkable.2014books-i-ownfavourites...more83 likes14 commentsLikeCommentDisplaying 1 - 30 of 51,168 reviewsMore reviews and ratingsJoin the discussion550quotes582discussions81questionsCan't find what you're looking for?Get help and learn more about the design.Help center\n",

Within New Zealand she has held writing fellowships at several universities, served on the Literary Fund Advisory Committee (1985–89) and the Indecent Publications Tribunal (1985–90), and in 1986–88 was appointed ‘cultural ambassador’ while travelling in connection with The Bone People.Born and raised in Otautahi, Christchurch, Hulme is the eldest of six children. Her father, a carpenter and first-generation New Zealander whose parents came from Lancashire, died when Hulme was 11. Her mother came from Oamaru, of Orkney Scots and Maori descent (Käi Tahu, Käti Mämoe). Hulme was schooled at North New Brighton Primary School and Aranui HS (Christchurch). Her holidays were spent with her mother’s extended family at Moeraki, on the Otago East Coast, a landscape filled with the residue of its Maori past, which remains important for linking Hulme with her Maori ancestors: ‘I love it better than any place on Earth. It is my turangawaewae-ngakau, the standing-place of my heart.’The Bone People (Spiral Collective, 1984) won the 1984 New Zealand Book Award for Fiction, and the prestigious international Booker Prize in 1985. 'Set on the harsh South Island beaches of New Zealand, bound in Maori myth and entwined with Christian symbols, Miss Hulme's provocative novel summons power with words, as a conjuror's spell. She casts her magic on three fiercely unique characters, but reminds us that we, like them, are 'nothing more than people', and that, in a sense, we are all cannibals, compelled to consume the gift of love with demands for perfection' (New York Times Book Review).Source: Read NZhttps://www.read-nz.org/writer/hulme-....Ratings&ReviewsWhat doyouthink?Rate this bookWrite a ReviewFriends&FollowingCreate a free accountto discover what your friends think of this book!Community Reviews4.0423,071ratings2,235reviews5 stars9,450 (40%)4 stars7,679 (33%)3 stars3,969 (17%)2 stars1,356 (5%)1 star617 (2%)Search review textFiltersDisplaying 1 - 30 of 2,235 reviewsAdina (way behind on reviews, some notifications)1,130 reviews4,719 followersNovember 16, 20223.5*Booker prize winner 1985I am going to be short because it's been two months since I finished this omne. The Bone People is one of those novels which divide readers. Some love it and some hate it.First of all, the writing style is extremely peculiar, a part poetry in prose, a part 3rd person narration and a part 1st person POV of different characters. The POV and writing style can change from one sentence to the next which gives the novel an air of surreality but it can also become frustrating, not always figuring out what is going on.Another reason it might not be a book for many is that it deals with child abuse. There are three main characters in the novel: one peculiar lady modelled after the author, a widower who finds and adopts a young mute boy and, finally, the child. It becomes clear quite early that the child suffered abuse even before it was found with no memory on a beach after his boat capsized. However, he is also abused by his adoptive father and an important part of the novel deals with guilt vs impulse for violence of the father, the trauma of the child and the woman's debate over the acceptability of this behaviour.Although the novel was hard to stomach, I appreciated its literary value and I do not regret reading it.bookernew-zealand262 likes19 commentsLikeCommentJude12 reviews21 followersSeptember 6, 2007I have read this book 11 times. It's not because of my faulty memory (although I do have one), it is because this is my favorite fiction book of all time. The shape is unusual for a novel - it is not told in one voice or from one point of view. At times there is an omniscient narrator and at others it is told in the first person. It is the story of the journeys of three people back to the landscape of family. Sometimes free verse, sometimes standard prose, always poetic. Keri Hulme plays with the shape and feel of words themselves, giving the book a sensory quality not usually found just by reading. I do not want to give too much away because I feel that discovering this book is sort of like going on an amazing drive through beautiful country - just around the next bend there will be something wonderful, but each person will be struck by different things. For those who don't speak Maori ( myself included), she keeps a handy glossary at the end of the book for the phrases that are thrown in occasionally.220 likes18 commentsLikeCommentHugh1,279 reviews49 followersApril 12, 2017An original, personal and visceral novel, which for me is the kind of book that justifies the existence of the Booker Prize. The surface story is about the interactions between three difficult and damaged people, but there is a lot more to it than that - plenty of Maori culture, mythology and language (fortunately most of the latter is translated in the glossary) and a mixture of first and third person narrative voices including quite a lot of poetry. That may sound difficult, but the core story is quite gripping , though I must admit that I didn't try to follow everything. Hulme's introduction says that it started as a short story, but the finished novel is much more than that.At the centre of the story is Kerewin Holmes, whose character must be at least slightly autobiographical. She is an artist of mixed European and Maori heritage, estranged from her family, who leads a self-sufficient and independent life in a tower she has built for herself on the New Zealand coast. Her life is disturbed when she finds a mute boy with an injured foot in her tower. The boy is Simon (or Haimona), who turns out to be a survivor of a shipwreck in which his parents are believed to have died. The third character is Joe, who found Simon and adopted him with his now dead wife. Both Joe and Kerewin are heavy drinkers. The story concerns their interactions, conflicts and culture clashes.The story touches on some difficult themes, particularly Joe's relationship with Simon, which mixes extreme physical violence with a love that Simon needs more than anything else. Kerewin is asexual and dislikes physical contact, she is also fiercely independent. Part of the story involves the mystery of Simon's background - for example it is known that he already bore the scars of physical abuse before his adoption. I won't say too much more about the plot - I'm not sure I entirely believed the happy ending but it occupies such a small part of the book that it almost feels like an afterthought.So a very interesting book, a little flawed but probably very memorable. I don't know why it took me so long to get round to reading it, but I would certainly recommend it.booker-winnersmodern-classicsmodern-lit...more130 likes22 commentsLikeCommentWhitaker297 reviews541 followersMay 28, 2014This novel is a shining jewel, one with a huge flaw in its centre.It is still, however, an impressive and beautiful work, and a hugely ambitious one: an attempt to create a story that marries the disparate identities—Maori and European—that make up present day New Zealand. There is a realism-based story of friendship, self-destruction, and child abuse, and there is a symbolism-filled story of healing, catharsis, and the necessary fusing of Maori and European civilisations. Each is well-told but they don’t fit together. This is a problem because they are the same story. Hulme’s writing sparkles and plays fantastic tricks of light and manages to—mostly—obscure that flaw, but can’t make it go away.The three main characters are Joe, Kerewin, and Simon/Haimona. They are respectively Maori, Maori-European, and European. All are estranged from their families and cultures, and deeply damaged. In each other, they find comfort and solace, but also hurt and pain. As I noted, a key story element in the novel is child abuse. It’s horrific and at the same time is a necessary trigger for the eventual catharsis that occurs.When asked whether Simon/Haimona is a Christ figure, Keri Hulme, in an interview, replied that she doesn’t like categorising him like that because it might cast an approbatory light on the child abuse that occurs. She went on to say that she wanted to write about child abuse because it is a problem in New Zealand that is not acknowledged.I can understand this desire. We can’t, however, get away from the symbolic, religious elements of the story because they seem just too carefully thought out and constructed. We have a trinity; we have a child that is “sacrificed” to a greater end; we have a father figure called Joseph; we have a mother figure who is a virgin; we even have a powerful image of the three in one: It is impossible tonotsee religious symbolism in this. To cap it all, the strength of the narrative derives its power from that symbolism.These elements are not forced. They carry weight in terms of who the characters are and in terms of their narrative arc. But the story of these individuals has a powerful current that runs counter to the symbolism of the narrative arc. It is difficult on the one hand to decry the abuse and at the same time to approve the catharsis that follows, but this is what the work demands.That Hulme even manages to fuse this contradiction into a whole is testimony to the strength of her writing. But it is not enough. The tension is just too great, and so, we see in it a crack, a cleavage that is not healed. Was this intentional: a symbol on a meta-fictional level of the cleavage between Maori and European civilisation in New Zealand? If so, that would be too clever by half. I would prefer actually that Hulme wanted to tell this story, and tried and failed to resolve its inherent contradictory forces. Somehow the passion behind that creative impulse moves me more than the idea of a cold crafting of a deliberately flawed work.[An interesting discussion the book may be read atThe Guardian Books Blog]fiction-1950-and-afternew-zealandz_2012-read81 likes13 commentsLikeCommentPaul1,343 reviews2,096 followersMay 22, 20194.5 starsThis was twelve years in the writing and was rejected by many publishers. It defies easy description and is very much set in the interface between Maori and western culture. There is complexity in the structure and a dose of magic realism at the end. The character of Kerewin Holmes is a remarkable creation who jumps out of the page.The novel revolves around three characters. Kerewin Holmes is a solitary woman living in a tower, a painter who does not paint and who is estranged from her family. Joe is the adoptive father of Simon, a boy washed up on the beach, who isn’t able to speak and who has considerable behavioural problems and no sense of personal property. Joe has relatively recently lost his wife and child and he is now bringing up Simon alone. In this he is struggling and he is physically abusive and violent towards Simon.Hulme is a great storyteller and her descriptions are vivid;''watching the blood sky swell and grow, dyeing the rainclouds ominously, making the far edge of the sea blistered and scarlet''There is a musicality and rhythm to it all; Hulme switches perspectives between her characters and mixes poetry with prose, also mixing English with indigenous Maori language.There are lots of themes. All of the main characters are isolated. A sense of home and family life is often seen as something to be strived for as Simon thinks;“He had endured it all. Whatever they did to him, and however long it was going to take, he could endure it. Provided that at the end he could go home. ……if he can’t go home, he might as well not be. They might as well not be, because they only make sense together. We have to be together. If we are not, we are nothing. We are broken.”Hulme has said that interwoven threads is one of her favourite images in the novel. Hulme has taken two elements of postcolonial literature, language and magic realism and uses them to good effect.One issue that cannot be avoided is the violence by Joe towards Simon. When Hulme writes the violence she strips back the language and makes it very stark. Hulme herself is very clear about why she did this; to address an issue in New Zealand. Hulme has stated that violence towards children was a “pervasive social problem in New Zealand, among Maoris and Pakeha . . . and she had written the bone people in part to draw attention to it”Hulme gives the reader nowhere to go with this; Joe by being violent loses his Maori language and sides with the Pakeha, the western colonizers. His attempt to destroy Simon seems linked to the destruction of Maori culture. His redemption is linked to his rediscovery of his roots and culture. I only found this partially convincing; male violence is male violence, wherever it is found.I must admit that I did struggle with some aspects of the ending, but the writing and language is captivating.women-of-colour-201769 likes8 commentsLikeCommentTrudie594 reviews705 followersDecember 15, 2018* 1.5 *( Warning : spoilers, trigger warnings and unpopular opinion time )C.K Stead is a fairly divisive figure in NZ literature and has been roundly rebuffed for his criticisms of bothThe Bone PeopleandThe LuminariesAfter readingThe Bone Peoplefor myself I went searching for his much maligned letter to the London Review of Books (1985) entitled \"Maoriness\" which can be found herehttps://www.lrb.co.uk/v07/n21/lettersIn amongst some perhaps unfortunately worded statements, I finally found a set of arguments about Hulme's novel that happen to dovetail almost exactly with my own reading of it. The letter is in no way entirely disparaging of the book and neither am I but this final paragraph stood out :-I’m glad The Bone People has been written and published. But when I stand back from it and reflect there is, in addition to the sense of its power, a bitter aftertaste, something black and negative deeply ingrained in its imaginative fabric, which no amount of revision or editing could have eliminated. I suspect it has its location in the central subject-matter, and that this is something it shares with Benjamin Britten’s opera Peter Grimes, a work which also presents extreme violence against a child, yet demands sympathy and understanding for the man who commits it. In principle, such charity is admirable. In fact, the line between charity and imaginative complicity is very fine indeed.A bitter after taste is precisely what I am left with here despite the books obvious power and lingering hold over me. Some of this writing is the best I have encountered in NZ literature, the sense of place, particularly for the South Island is unparalleled and Hulme takes a delight in word-play and poetry that initially made me think this was going to be a 5-star read. Also as Stead states :-Simon is a major fictional character, the most complete, convincing and fascinating of the three, and all the more remarkable in that his personality has to be conveyed to us without spoken languageI would go further and say that Kerewin is just as fascinating. A singular personality the more so because she is so obviously a fantastical version of Keri Hulme herself. This makes things all the more problematic for me because despite the love she demonstrated for thisGoblin, sun childas she calls Simon/Himi she fails him over and over again.Lets take a look at how dated and tone deaf some of the this central subject matter is. I will let Joe and Kerewin do the talking here :At the moment he'd rather cut his throat than hurt his son, but he knows from broken past resolutions, that come the morning if the child is sulky or rude or baulks at doing what he is told, he'll welt him with a cold and righteous intent(Joe)well what the hell do I do now ?o I know what I am supposed to do, ring up child welfare and report the bloody mess he is in.\"Excuse me, i know a small child who's getting bashed it looks like he been bashed with a whip (but i hope to god not )\"I had suspicions when he was here with his face batteredBut he never said it was Joe, and Joe didn't admit it was himI've seen him slappedHell everyone slaps kids( Kerewin, internal monologue)for the first time it comes to her that she is aiding and abetting the concealment of a criminal offence( and yet at no stage does she show any personal regret at not doing anything sooner )We just decided that if Himi ever needs a hiding again, Joe will wait till I agree to it, soo she shrugs comfortable in her power ... that should prevent Himi getting damaged again(wrong )You could argue that this is not the author condoning violence but rather shining a light upon it and yet there is this all too pervasive, anti-establishment rhetoric here that argues that a child no matter what occurs is best with his foster father even if that person hits you so hard you are now deaf.The pity of it all is that they are wrong .... you've given him a solid base of love to grow from, for all the hardship you've put him through. You have been mother and father and home to him. And probably tomorrow they will read you a smug little homily, castigating you for ill-treatment and neglect. And the'll congratulate themselves quite publically for rescuing the poor urchin from this callous ogre, this nightmare of a parent..... At least you worried enough about his wrong doing to try to correct it( Kerewin )The Church, doctors, psychiatrists, meddling family members, North Islanders, the middle classes and child protective services all come in for snide asides in this book, which I think says more about the authors own views on the \"establishment\" than any real commentary on the problem of child abuse in this country.I said I hope your father knocks you sillier than you are now you stupid little bastard.( Kerewin ) as said to a 7 year-old Simon over the phone and essentially giving permission for the beating that ensues, doubly horrific after her promises to protect him.I know I exacerbated his reckless wounding of himself, but now I am not allowed to give him even shelter(Joe demonstrating a lack of comprehension that his actions towards the child he loves left him deaf and brain damaged and his entire body covered in scar tissue ...)wonder if he is up and about or playing the discreet vegetable still( Kerewin) What is this tone, levity ? I literally blanched and put the book down here ).Sure, it is possible to readThe Bone Peoplein ways that are less literal and you can equally put forth quotes that highlight other less distasteful aspects as well as the beautiful writing but that can't disguise the deeply disturbing undertone that pervaded the entire book. In the end, I decided this was 550 pages of Keri Hulme expounding on Keri Hulme and the poor bedevilled Simon a mere plot device to make some statement about spiritual awakening and the power of love to overcome personal failings.( The rating given reflects my distaste for the handling of the subject matter not as a reflection for the quality of the writing which is mostly exceptional and of course this is all a personal opinion and I do not hold any grudge towards readers who found this an entirely different and more worthy experience )booker-prize-winnersibrnew-zealand60 likes55 commentsLikeCommentAdam27 reviews2 followersFebruary 5, 2013The Bone People had been on my to-read shelf for almost a year, so I decided that it was a good first read of 2013. I wanted to like it; indeed, for the first hundred pages or so, I did. The language is unconventional but richly textured and evocative (and exotic to this American boy). This was enough that I didn't notice some major flaws until I was too far in to quit reading. Once I noticed them, however, they were impossible to un-notice.My first problem with the book is that one slowly realizes that Kerewin is a bothersome character. Since she is arguably the most important character, this is an issue. If you've familiar with the mysterious, sometimes scary realm of fan fiction, you'll know the termMary Sue.Kerewin has got the Mary Sues something bad. The similarity of her name to the author's is only the first clue. She's also fabulously wealthy, talented in art, music, and language, a survivalist, and oh--she can kill a man with her bare hands. In conversation and in monologue, she sounds exactly like someone with all of these traits would sound: that is, she sounds ridiculous. About three quarters of the way though the book, I was wincing every time she opened her mouth.Then there's the child abuse thing. I understand that their relationship is supposed to represent the cultural conflict, but Joe beats the crap out of Simon. Kerewin doesn't like it but doesn't really do much about it. They both let the kid smoke and drink, for cryin' out loud. Joe’s presented in a disturbingly sympathetic light, and we're supposed to be okay with it all at the end, because he finds an ancient god and is redeemed.Yep, that’s right. Actually, everyone finds an ancient god, and all of their troubles vanish. Kerewin’s cancer disappears, and she is reunited with her family. The ending of this book is just chock full of deus ex machina. The last fifty pages creak under the weight of it. Everything is mended between Joe and Simon. They all move in together, and it’s swell. I could overlook the other flaws of the book if it wasn't for this. The characters don't earn their own redemption or suffer because of their own mistakes. The gods fix everything. Maybe it’s a grand metaphor for cultural healing or the power of tradition, but it just doesn’t work.I'm not exactly sorry that I read The Bone People, but I don't think I recommend it.56 likes3 commentsLikeCommentHanneke366 reviews452 followersDecember 27, 2017So, okay, Ms. Hulme, I already felt rather suffocated by your novel throughout the book, but you really tried to strangle me with your final chapters. I was going to rate the novel 3 stars. However, after those last chapters, I will now grant it a mere one star plus another one for the rather picturesque writing throughout the book.Let me explain. I rather liked the sing-song quality of the narrative and in particular the inserted little snippets of poetry, contemplations and lamentations. What I truly hated were the two main characters who are just utterly unsympathetic. Hulme’s apparent alter ego, Kerewin, has serious character flaws and feels so elevated from mere humans that she does not want to commit herself in any way, even if a six year old boy, whom she claims to love, is ferociously beaten on several occasions, the last abuse so severe that the boy is within inches of death. She is convinced that the father, her new friend Joe, cares about his adopted son and that should be a sufficient reason to excuse his behaviour and for herself no reason to act in a decisive way. Subsequently, at the end of the book, Hulme seems to insist that her readers accept her idea of the redemption and forgiveness of Joe. It feels to me that she forgets that her readers might feel pretty disgusted by both Kerewin’s and Joe’s earlier pathological behaviour and are not in the mood to forget what transpired before. To help her doubting readers, she introduces sudden magical occurences which result in the elevation of Joe to a moral, even saintly, human being. Sorry, what drivel! Needless to say, I was relieved to finish the book.44 likes23 commentsLikeCommentLuke1,519 reviews1,052 followersDecember 17, 20154.5/5A rare mix of characters and languages and emotions indeed. Gripping. Kerewin is one of my all-time favorite characters; she's everything I am and so much more. The talent and the energy and the drive. Simply beautiful. I can't forgive Joe though. I can't.I don't see any justification for his violence. Is this how males get? Is this how their logic works? It has no place in society, whatever their excuses and reasoning and past horrific experiences may be. What he did to Simon was unforgivable, and the way the book kept pushing them together was unbearable. No one should go through that much torture and horde the blame for themselves.Moving on though. The story builds and builds and then the ending. Hardly satisfying, especially given all the hinting and foreshadowing. It was all too easy, really. A happy family reunion, after all that? Unlikely. The flow of words was nice, I have to admit. The Maori language has a certain running quality that makes the sprinkling through tolerable, almost pleasant, despite the lack of understanding. So, higher than a four, but not a five. I don't agree with all of it. But I can't deny its unique beauty.4-starantidote-think-twice-allantidote-think-twice-read...more37 likes16 commentsLikeCommentBritta BöhlerAuthor8 books1,990 followersNovember 6, 2022I am a not overly enthusiastic about this book.

Hulme paints a vivid, realistic picture and the characters (even the abusive stepfather) are not 'black and white'. But the 'hollywood-ending', where all is hopeful and the abusive father is reformed, didn't ring true to me.Still, for readers interested in Maori culture the book might be worthwile.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review01women100101women1001-readaussie-lit...more33 likes13 commentsLikeCommentIsis831 reviews49 followersMarch 3, 2009I out myself as a philistine, I guess, with my dislike of this painfully literary book, which I read only because I was in New Zealand and thought I ought to read a famous NZ author.

This winner of the Man Booker prize is painful to read. It forces the reader to consider the complexity of human nature and behavior -- how thin the line can be between love and abuse. It is set in New Zealand and is about three wounded and likeable characters - a man, a woman, and a child.booker-prize-winners30 likes1 commentLikeCommentSaraAuthor1 book820 followersMarch 13, 2022Art and family by blood; home and family by love…regaining any one was worth this fiery journey to the heart of the sun.Keri Hulme’sThe Bone Peopleis a complex story of love, isolation, and a search for identity, set in her native New Zealand. Much of the complexity of this novel rises from its treatment of opposites and how they interact and weave together in a life. How, for example, do love and cruelty exist within the same person and toward the same object? How does a person sort the good and bad and decide whether the one can ever offset the other? How does an individual balance his need for solitude with his need for companionship and understanding?The three main characters are a half-Maori woman, Kerewin Holmes, who becomes involved in the lives of Joe, a Maori man, and his foster son, Simon, a white child. Kerewin is separated from her family and living an isolated life by choice, but in despair for the family she has lost.A family can be the bane of one's existence. A family can also be most of the meaning of one's existence. I don't know whether my family is bane or meaning, but they have surely gone away and left a large hole in my heart.Joe is grieving the loss of his wife and natural child to flu, and he is struggling with the difficulties that come with being a single parent to his foster son, who has disabilities and sometimes unbridled rage. Simon is unable to speak, an affliction that stems from his own loss of parents, and which is apparently psychosomatic rather than physical, but he has an intelligence that is sharp and so he rebels against not being understood or sometimes even acknowledged. Unlikely as it seems, the three form a bond that stems from some ability they have to understand one another, an ability that no doubt stems from their lonely, unfathomable similarities.There is, at the heart of this novel, a dichotomy that I had difficulty dealing with, and that is the idea that a person could love deeply someone and yet hurt them repeatedly and severely. In order for the book to work, I believe this is a contradiction that you must accept. And, you must accept this as a path to self-discovery and self-recognition that can bring redemption. While I doubt I could ever believe this in the real world I live in, somehow I came to within the confines of this story.Another aspect of the book that is very important, and which I admit to understanding only on a level that feels wholly inadequate, is the Maori culture and the search for identity within the peoples of New Zealand. Both Joe and Kerewin are a part of the Maori culture, and both are trying to live within the Pakeha (European) culture that has displaced it. The strength for each of them comes from the connection to their Maori roots and a large part of their hope for salvation lies in being able to reconnect to that lost part of themselves. I believe it is no accident that the pure Maori, the mixed Maori/Pakeha, and the pure Pakeha are represented in the three main characters, and that part of the struggle for them is to learn how to live together in harmony.This is not an easy book. It is well-written, but written in an unusual style that incorporates various voices and the use of both prose, poetry and a vague stream of consciousness. It suffers a few times from being bogged down and repetitive, and would have benefited from being cut down in length by a good editor. However, it is a prodigious enterprise that leaves a stunning impression on the reader. Hats off to Keri Hulme. Definitely worth the reading!2022-aty-challengearchive-orgculture...more33 likes14 commentsLikeCommentAlbert460 reviews54 followersMarch 13, 2022The novel revolves around three characters and their relationships with one another; each of the three feels separated from their community for different reasons. Kerewin Holmes is a painter and a loner who values her solitude. She comes from a wealthy family from whom she is estranged, but she lacks for nothing material that she wants. She lives in a tower, alone, she does not seek out interaction with others, she does not like to be touched and like the author, considers herself asexual.Joe Gillaylay, is a factory worker. He and his wife had adopted Simon, the lone survivor of a shipwreck. Joe then lost his wife and baby son to illness, and he was left alone to raise Simon. Simon is mute but has developed a short-hand method of speaking with his hands; he can also write very well at a young age. Simon is unable or unwilling to share anything he knows about his life prior to the shipwreck.In each other, Kerewin, Joe and Simon find something they need, something they are missing, a blend of love, friendship and understanding. There is an intense love between Joe and Simon. Beware, though, at the core of the story there is extremely violent child abuse.I know some readers will not want to read a story that deals so explicitly with child abuse. I think the author attempts to address the issue honestly. I have found novels that deal with ugly, distressing behavior to ultimately be some of my favorites (Lolita, The Collector). In addition to the subject matter, this novel was challenging to read. It incorporates a lot of indigenous, Maori, language but there is a translation reference at the back of the book to help you. More challenging is a mixture of 1st and 3rd person narratives, with the 1st person moving between the three main characters. There is also quite a bit of poetry interspersed throughout the story. For me it was helpful to not expect myself to understand everything, but instead to focus on enjoying the story, the characters and the setting. I did not feel the ending fit the story very well.For anyone willing to take on the described challenges, I highly recommend The Bone People. The Bone People won The Booker Award in 1985; Keri Hulme was the first New Zealander to win this award. The Bone People is the only novel that Hulme has completed to date.award-booker-prizeaward-winners-readgeo-new-zealand...more25 likes3 commentsLikeCommentGeorge IlsleyAuthor12 books294 followersMay 26, 2023Have read this New Zealand novel a few times, and it never fails to grab onto my guts and wrench me into feeling so bad, and so good, all at the same times.

Hulme's writing is raw and deeply sensual, often with a visceral quality.Frequent use of the Maori language (although not too much that it inhibits understanding) further adds to the immersive, transporting power of the novel, making readers feel like they are witnessing authentic interactions.Psychologically complex in its themes and ideas; astute examination of such \"phenomena\" as violence as a form of love, the nuanced repercussions of trauma, psychological struggles pertaining to belonging, identity, and loneliness.Controversial topics are opened for much thought long after three last pages, particularly on morality. How much is too much when it comes to discipline. Questions of culpability- say, as occurred in this (thankfully) fictional story, you were consulted beforehand and \"let\" a father abuse a child? Does whatever happened thereafter fall under your responsibility? Are words only words?One of the few books- particularly fiction books- thatHas a touch of magical realism (for fans of the genre) as well as references to spirituality and the occult, such as medicinal potions and tarot reading.The Bad:Experimental techniques, as noted below, can be discombobulating and make the story difficult to fully understand.A good portion of the poetry is beautifully written. However, there is also much that may have been intended as \"art\", but honestly reads as incomprehensible, pretentious gibberish.Religious connection here comes off as forced and intrusive; doesn't even make it's argument clear. Father (figure) named Joseph, Trinity of three main characters, sacrifices, renewal, religious awakenings, virgin mother- a mother figure who is a virgin. The entire final section which mentions Christianity frequently, yet still makes little to no sense except broad allusions to ancestors, Maori culture, various religions.There is undoubtedly much lost in translation, but too much seems deliberately alienating- not only drenched in Maori vernacular, but also occult and even witchcraft, venturing into such beliefs as cannibalism. While this may be fascinating, more fascinating would be fascinating material conveyed in a comprehendible manner.An uncomfortable read for most, with graphic scenes, violence, and some darker forays into the human psyche.Takes a questionable moral stance on a few issues, primarily alcoholism (in general and by a young boy), smoking (mostly cigars, also by a kid), and child abuse. At best it condones, at worst it endorses. Here is the worst of it: \"... it all shows you cared deeply. In a negative way, so does the fact that you beat him. At least, you worried enough about what you considered was his wrongdoing to try and correct it.\" (page 235) So causing near lethal pain and suffering is true love?The \"Experimental\":The text has a disconnected quality, namely due to the intermittent Maori phrases. Although most can be guessed at through the context, it can feel jarring. Hulme includes a glossary at the back of the book, selecting some words and phrases either at random or those she deemed most important and listed by page number. But this resulted in more intrusion than aid. Some suggestions that would have been far more effective: 1) have a general glossary in alphabetical order, 2) to have actually defined every word written in Maori rather than selectively 3) used reference symbols like in footnotes to prevent unproductive flipping to the back. As it is written, readers will unfortunately likely find themselves flipping to the back frequently, only to be frustrated most times upon discovery that Hulme did not deem a word or phrase worthy of the glossary. It seems like she may have purposely been selective with her glossary entries, in order to alienate the reader a little bit not not too much.The novel is told from three character perspectives. Frequently, Hulme will segue into internal monologue, clearly marked by an indented paragraph. What is not so clear is exactly whose thoughts they are and when she deems it necessary to indent, as other internal thoughts are written with regular formatting. With characters also referring to themselves in third person, it is often difficult to discern whose point of view is indeed being taken.Dreams play a significant part, sometimes interspersed between narrative of what is taking place in reality. Can be confusing to tell which is which.Several instances where Hulme writes poetry or something that certainly wouldn't quite be considered prose. Fragmentary, vague words and passages.Mysticism, folklore, myths and legends plays as a backdrop throughout the narrative, and takes center stage in the third and final part of the novel- in which a spiritual trek and awakening takes place involving Maori ancestors and gods. By far the most gibberish- sounding portion of the book.#TheGoodTheBadThe_Review #adoption #alcoholism #artistlife #asexuality #barasmainsetting #BookerPrize #bothoneandfivestars #beach #bloodyviolent #cannibalism #castle #childabuse #childPOV #Christianity #crime #deathofspouse #dreams #dubiousparentage #fatherson #folklore #fuckedupchildhood #ghost #island #kleptomania #loneliness #magicalrealism #multiplepointsofview #musicperformance #mute #mystery #nature #NewZealand #occult #onaboat #orphan #parenting #PegasusPrize #poetry #religion #streamofconsciousness #storywithinastory #suicide #uniquechaptertitles #weatherThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review23 likes2 commentsLikeCommentMeredith26 reviews7 followersAugust 20, 2007I cannot put my finger on why I love this book. I didn't really think it all that special when I read it, but it has stayed in my mind so vividly when many a lesser book has dissipated from my memory. I think the authors descriptions are understated while being vivid. I read the book years ago and I can still remember clearly descriptions of meals cooked, of the matter-of-fact efficiency the main character displayed in her solitude. All of the characters are overtly flawed, and the author doesn't just skip over that to tell a \"happily ever after\" story about friendship. Maybe I loved this book because it is not a fairytale. The characters you grow to love and empathize with are also the ones that drink to much and beat their children, or the ones who steal from you after you've generously given them money. These are not the heroes we put next to flags or on films, but they still come across the page as lovable. A very provacative novel.23 likes3 commentsLikeCommentDavid689 reviews183 followersDecember 23, 2018What a mess of a novel. The initial promise of a 4-star experience was systematically dismantled by the author herself. Interesting setting and carefully crafted imagery are ultimately all for naught. Hulme launches her literary clay pigeons and then recklessly shoots each one out of the sky until all that's left are shards nobody cares about.What follows is a rant so feel free to stop reading here if that kind of review upsets you.Broken, wounded people can, and do, perpetrate terrible harm upon themselves and others. It is mighty unpleasant to read about such things but I do so (now and then) to expand my sensibilites; I won't walk away from a book just because it's emotionally challenging. But we all have our limits and this one tested mine repeatedly. Take such a story, stretch it out for 550 pages, romanticize the suffering, and consistently make excuses for the hideous abuse on display, and you have definitely lost me. Add to all this the many uneducated, simple characters using words like \"exemplar\" and \"fanatacism\" - and Dr. Sinclair Fayden, World's Least Convincing Pediatrician, who smokes cigars with his seven-year-old patients and colludes with victims of Child Abuse in order to \"sneak\" them back into the care of their abusers - and it's easy to understand why Hulme \"had been rejected by some of the country's major publishers\".There are aspects of \"The Bone People\" that made it interesting and not a complete waste of time. This is a rare international award-winning novel from New Zealand, and that stunning landscape and environment are strongly represented. Maori language and culture permeate throughout. The celebration of coastal living really appealed to me, having been raised by a rugged shore myself. It is always compelling to have outsiders as protagonists and everyone here is beyond mainstream society. And there is a strong presence of ancient spritual voices. So much potential!In terms of characterization, I was most fascinated by Kerewin. There is a lot going on there. Her abundant flaws - including some very unattractive traits - are believable and well-delineated. Given that she's clearly autobiographical might explain her particular strength. In any event, she's well done. Simon followed next as often interesting but he is also a bit of an avatar and not fully developed. Joe, however, was quite poor in many respects and the least persuasive protagonist. In fact almost every minor character (many of whom appear indirectly and for only a few pages) seemed more credible.Hulme's attempts at giving Joe depth did not work for me. The information she provides the reader - by way of explaining the motivations behind his erratic, destructive behaviors - is weak and unconvincing. We are asked to believe that he is intelligent, perceptive, charming, and willing to do just about anything in order to bring love back into his life. Why, then, the Jekyll and Hyde transformations which are brought on by the smallest of insults? Why the careful depictions of shame and remorse followed by his casual returns to obscene violence against a vulnerable child? Why his inability to understand Simon when their behaviors are so similar? When Joe takes center stage after page 400, it became much harder to stay interested in the proceedings. I was ultimately undone by this supposed epiphany following his release from prison:\"I know I exacerbated his reckless wounding of himself, but now I am not allowed to give him even shelter...\"This is the extent of his understanding following a criminal conviction for extreme, chronic child abuse? Aue. He aha tou mate? E whakama ana au ki a koe! I realize that we all have contradictory natures, but this is the very antithesis of intelligent, perceptive, and charming. It was all a bridge too far and a road too long.\"The Bone People\" is obviously not New Zealand's best effort in fiction and I look forward to better experiences ahead.1.5 stars rounded upThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review23 likes10 commentsLikeCommentWyndy216 reviews96 followersAugust 6, 2018One of the most original, difficult, and compelling books I’ve read in a long, long time. I don’t really know how to explain this novel or the spell it cast on me, so I’ll throw out some random tidbits: An artist and loner named Kerewin Holmes, estranged from her family and resistant to human touch, lives alone in a remote tower near the Tasman sea. A mute young boy washes up on a New Zealand beach, barely alive after surviving a boat wreck that assumedly kills his parents, with no clues to his identity. Joe Gillayley, a local factory worker and happily married man, finds the child, names him Simon, and provides him a home with himself and his wife. These three individual characters - Kerewin, Simon and Joe - become inextricably bound, and this novel is their complex story. There’s mystery and tension, brutality and gentleness, Maori magic and spirits, despair and hope.This was a stunning, though often uncomfortable, read for me, and it’s certainly not for everyone (as you can see from the varying GR reviews). If you decide to read this 1985 Booker and Pegasus Prize winner, my advice is don’t try to make sense of every word - just let some of the unusual free verse and random, alternating narrative wash over you. This one is going on my keepers shelf (at least for now) to join some other favorites I plan to reread.booker-finalistsmagical-realismnew-zealand21 likes10 commentsLikeCommentVivian2,888 reviews472 followersOctober 19, 2017The ocean was the only song in the book that I enjoyed.That said, it was a fascinating insight, but, like a door you never wished you opened. Hulme is a gifted wordsmith, rich, evocative language that paints a harsh and salt-stained landscape, which really gives a sense of New Zealand's vast wild spaces, also the staggering alcoholism, racial tensions and blithe brutality. . From a strictly objective point of view the story is stunning. Truly. Unfortunately, it is drawn out.Reading about people getting blinding drunk, being stupid, belligerent and abusive-- and then sick, nine of out ten days is not riveting.Reading about a kid being brutally beaten regularly, not a couple slaps or strops of a belt, but broken bones and scars that will never go away physically or emotionally, is depressing.Reading about other people thinking something should be done, and doing nothing, well... that's F#@king infuriating.I have to give some leeway for the fact that this was published in the eighties. While corporal punishment used to be commonplace, thrashing your kids was not. It was never acceptable.There is a mysticism and magical realism employed within the story that blend well with the native Maori beliefs. There is an intense amount of Maori language used, so the index in the back is not a perhaps I'll use it supplemental because unless you understand basic phrases, titles, and terms of endearment then you'll miss significant context. I read this in paperback form so I can not speak to whether or not ebooks have clickable references, but it would be invaluable.Finally, my knowledge of NZ politics and racial issues is nil or near as nil as to be completely useless. Nonetheless, it is obvious within the story how characters are judged on how \"Maori\" they are from physical looks, to language skills, and beliefs. This is interesting, but it also makes the brutality of Simon, an extraordinarily \"white\" character disturbing. I haven't read any critiques about this, but it would be interesting to discuss with someone who had greater understanding of the issues.So, the theme really didn't appeal to me. The storytelling itself is beautifully worded if repetitive and drawn-out. The ending, well here's where it fell apart. Unrealistic and vague, as if more palatable closure was needed then either was laid out throughout the story or frankly, deserved by the characters.As much as I love the ocean, I don't want to visit here, again.Betelgeuse, Achenar.

It checks of a few boxes for me - Oceania 2015, a Man Booker Prize winner (I'd like to read them all eventually) from 1985, female author, etc. Keri Hulme is also part Maori, which made this a deeper cultural read about the country.From the publisher's description, I was expecting a pretty straight-forward novel:\"In a tower on the New Zealand sea lives Kerewin Homes, part Maori, part European, an artist estranged from her art, woman in exile from her family. One night her solitude is disrupted by a visitor – a speechless, mercurial boy named Simon, who tries to steal from her and then repays her with his most precious possession. As Kerewin succumbs to Simon’s feral charms, she also falls under the spell of his Maori foster father Joe, who rescued the boy from a shipwreck and now treats him with an unsettling mixture of tenderness and brutality.\"Instead I discovered a book mixing poetry inside of prose, stream of consciousness inside of third-person narrative, rotating points of view inside three unusual minds, and a setting with fantastical elements, sometimes from Maori mythology, sometimes Keriwen's or Simon's own ideas. It was simultaneously easy and complex to read and is unlike anything else I can think of that I've read.It's funny because the only books I can think of that are similar are recent New Zealand reads. I don't think it is a unique experience to New Zealanders where the outsides don't match the insides, but so far that has been a far more prominent theme in New Zealand literature than in any other place of origin. The insides that are unexpected range from artistry to mental illness, abuse to psychopathy. The world is seen both as it is and in an elevated sense, through the lens of myth or a different mind. Why in New Zealand, I wonder? Is the mystical connection to the land just that more recent here of all places?Don't listen to the people who poo-poo this book.

The characters are well drawn. I wanted to hate Joe, but he was in so much pain that I couldn't, really. I never excused what he did - and Hulme did not ask the reader to do that. She challenges the reader to look at our society as a whole; to see what we do to people and how we as communities play a role in creating some of the violent, terrible situations that result in children being abused.I know that some people found that the mysticism in the latter section of the novel took away from the book. I disagree. I found that it fit in well with the story and helped flesh out some of the messages the author was trying to get across. Some of the imagery in this novel is absolutely breathtaking. I have never been so utterly moved and transfixed by a novel as I have by this one. It challenged my perceptions and it made me a different person when I was finished it.The book is quite long, and it can be slow in a few spots. I found that I had to read it twice. I admit I did hate Joe the first time I read the novel; I really only began to understand him the second time I read the book. This is a complex, multi-layered work that speaks to a wide range of issues: child abuse, spirituality, community, and culture.I highly recommend this novel to everyone.

The Bone People is the opposite kind of book, to the extent that coming back to write this review I was surprised to find I had given it two stars instead of one.Where to begin with this terrible attempt at a novel? Well, the opening of poems and snippets of disjointed text without context served as a confusing start to the book, and even once you return to it after finishing the book and knowing what is going on it's needlessly opaque. In general the structure of the book is a mess, with the first two-thirds of the book being an almost completely realistic depiction of life before switching over in the final third to a story replete with the supernatural. Jarring, to say the least. Additionally, this book is far longer than it needed to be, and a properly aggressive editor would likely have shaved off at least a hundred pages.Beyond the structure the content is also painfully bad. The main character, Holmes, is a bizarre insert of the author that is a rich, brilliant artist who is also a martial arts master. Sure she laments at times about her lack of connection to other people, but the book paints this as Holmes being too cool for everyone else more than an actual inability to be social with other people. She feels like a edgier attempt at a Mary-Sue, and at times I cringed while reading the parts of the book focusing on her.She's not the main problem, however, as the character of Joe and the book's attitude toward his actions fills that role. It is revealed somewhere at around the halfway mark that Joe is being abusive toward his adopted son Simon, the third main character. We're talking beatings that put Simon's life in danger. The book still treats Joe as a sympathetic character despite this, even when Joe's beatings put Simon in the hospital and bring him within a hair's breadth of death.Hulme is on record as saying she wanted to write about the issue of child abuse when she wrote The Bone People. Someone needs to tell her that writing about an issue is more than just including an instance of that issue happening in your book, you also have to explore the effect of that message or take a stand on that issue. I'm assuming she didn't intend to do either, because the end of the novel appears to preach that child abuse isn't that bad and that being around an abusive adult is a good option so long as he claims to care. At the end of the story Simon is desperate to return to Joe, his abuser, and in general the novel takes the approach that by removing the child from his care the government was making a mistake, as they just \"didn't understand the relationship the two had.\"Such a message is disgusting. I'm going to give Hulme the benefit of the doubt and assume she's merely an incompetent writer, instead of evil.15 likes2 commentsLikeCommentJohn1,424 reviews111 followersNovember 29, 2023I thought I had read this novel when it was first published but now I am unsure. Memory or false memory is a strange feeling. Being a New Zealander I can understand the context of punishment on children. When I was growing up their was still corporal punishment at school. Parents did not spare the rod or in my mums case the rarely used wooden spoon while my father his hands. Now I think New Zealand has changed although their is still child abuse it is not on the scale it was historically.Simon, Joe and Kerewin all have their demons. The adults fueled by alcohol and lack if control. Simon, mute and traumatized by a ship wreck and a past of fear and abuse. The story is a fable. The stereotype of Maori being mystical and spiritual is for the majority a fantasy. Although there are some and it’s growing where their history and heritage is part of their identity.Kerrwin is too good to be true. Artist, philosopher, martial arts expert and of course estranged from her family without any explanation of why. Joe a laborer in a factory given custody of Simon after his wife died. Unlikely, he struggles to understand Simons violence, destructive behavior and the only discipline he has is his fists.Towards the end of the book they all undertake a metamorphosis. Joe is healed mentally and spiritually after getting out of jail by meeting an old Maori who is the guardian of a relic and been waiting for him. Joe becomes the new guardian. Simon recovers in hospital and becomes more stable but still independent. Kerewin goes to the brink of death and is in a way reborn a better person. She forgives and becomes more giving, accepting and tolerant.A strange book and by its very strangeness a worthy winner of the Booker Prize. Yes, it is a visceral story with child abuse and the language is repetitive at times. I would still recommend it. During my reading of the book the author Keri Hulme died. She never wrote another novel but this one is a fine tribute.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full reviewman-booker-prize-winners16 likesLikeCommentSemjon697 reviews447 followersSeptember 23, 2021Dieses mit dem Booker Prize prämierte Werk aus dem Jahr 1985 ist wahrlich schwere Kost. Wer dezidierte Schilderungen von Gewalt gegen Kinder nicht lesen kann, dem sei davon abgeraten. Ich denke, dass ich hart im Nehmen bin, aber zumindest verstört und mitgenommen war ich durch die Schilderung des Dreiecksverhältnisses Junge-Adoptivvater-Nachbarin auf jeden Fall. Keri Hulme nimmt sich sehr viel Zeit, ihre handelnden Person durch Selbstreflexionen, Gedankenströme, Schilderung von Handlung und Dialogen plastisch werden zu lassen. Ihr Schreibstil ist dabei sehr eigenwillig und komplex, da die vier genannten Erzählformen und erzählende Person teilweise von Satz zu Satz wechseln können. Dies erfordert vom Leser Phantasie und vor allem komplexes Denken und viel Aufmerksamkeit beim Lesen. Ich habe schon lange nicht mehr so viel Lesezeit für ein 650 Seiten Buch gebraucht. Das liest man nicht mal so nebenher.Simon, der Siebenjährige, ist Überlebender eines Schiffsunglück in Neuseeland. Seine Herkunft ist nicht bekannt. Er wird nach dem Unglück von Joe, einem Maori, groß gezogen. Simon spricht nicht, ist rebellisch und in seinem Zorn kaum zu beendigen. Joe bestraft ihn mit Schlägen, die aber keine Wirkung auf das Verhalten des Kleinen haben. Eines Tages taucht der Junge bei Kerewen auf, eine Achtel Maori, die eigentlich keinen Wert auf den Kontakt legt, doch sie kommt von Joe und Simon nicht los. Alle drei Figuren sind gefangen in ihren Problemen und Unzulänglichkeiten. Doch so gebrochen brauchen sie auch Halt und diesen finden sie dann doch immer wieder in dem toxischen Dreieck.Ich fand dies sehr beeindruckend geschrieben, auch wenn vor allem am Ende die maorische Mystik über meine Vorstellungskraft ging, was zum Sternabzug führt. Über weite Strecken ist dies ein 5-Sterne-Psychogramm von Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach sich selbst und die Liebe Anderer verloren haben.

There are a few reasons for this but chiefly it is because this story is devastating.We have a bizarre world and narrative to wade through, limericks and soliloquies, mysticism, maori history (and language) all combined with insanity. Three main characters who are out of their minds. Put this all together and a fresh, quirky story could be delivered but that's not what happened here. All of this was injected into the very real and horrifying reality of child abuse. Between all the weird sidebars and references to new zealand flora and fauna there are two people who fall into the gray middle area that life truly is. Joe, in particular, is likable. He's the life of the party, he's emotional, funny, caring and of course there were times when I found myself longing for the obvious love story. And that jolts me. He beats his son. Physically this boy is broken, emotionally he is caught up in the abusive cycle, instigating his own beatings to get to the make up happy again part.For entertainment, when I sit with a book I've realized there has come to be an expectation of clear boundaries, protagonists and antagonists, the crisis and the resolution. Rarely in life are there actually people who can be defined as evil or good as they are in books and cinema. But it is relaxing to the mind to get to know a character and file them away in the nice or naughty folders. In real life, child abusers are people not archetypes. And in The Bone People, a horrifyingly real situation plays out and all the reader can do is sit there, aghast and depressed. At times the garble/poem-speak would cloud out the events and I would have to go back and make sure I was understanding correctly.... it certainly made the story-telling unique but in some ways it disrespected the story that needed to be clearly told for Simon/Haimona/Claire.I did not like the story arc and I did not like the ending. I went back and forth, rapidly turning pages to putting the book down for days (read:weeks) because it was just too damn much, too frustrating, too painful and, frankly, too long.I did not like diluted moral of the story either. I mean, when I arrived at the last page I felt boggled. Am I supposed to feel happy? Relieved? Am I to think we have a reformed man here, changed by the grace of a gemstone, who is not going to beat his child anymore and will live happily ever after with his not-so-depressed anymore miraculous cancer survivor girlfriend?I'm going to save the rest of my thoughts for book club discussion and hopefully put more order to them in the process.book-club13 likesLikeCommentCherie1,332 reviews132 followersAugust 25, 2016I don't hate it.

This novel is full of violence and twisted emotions, making this a tense and draining book to read.Something I really liked about this novel was Keri Hulme’s use of silence as tool that drives the plot. Simon is unable to speak, but we find out this is more of a psychological rather than a physical restriction, as he can sing. I think he is afraid to say the wrong thing, a defensive strategy. He uses notes as a primary form of communication, this way there are no expressions of his emotion and he can protect himself. The book goes a little further, Simon is also silent about the pain, when he is beaten he doesn’t make a sound. Kerewin also uses silence in a similar way, she built her tower to hide away and be a recluse; no one can hurt her if she is in solitude. She is always an artist suffering from a creative silence; not being able to let her creative side flow through her art. You can read this book and find many examples of silences within it; very effective and I spent a lot of time trying to work out the meaning behind it.Each character has been damaged that their defensive mechanisms make it hard to open up to others. Yet the three main characters spend the entire novel trying to work out what love is and how to find it. They are all isolated themselves from the world; Kerewin in her tower, Simon with his inability to steak and Joe with his grief. There is just so many themes you could look at in The Bone People, the idea of a utopian society uniting Maori and Western culture, Post-colonial discourse, cultural illness, violence as a way to communicate and you can just go on and on.This is not the easiest book to read, it is confronting and tense. The Bone People left me with mixed emotions; on one hand the writing was wonderful and left me thinking about so many issues but on the other hand the violence just left me with a sick feeling. I often try to leave my emotional opinion of the subject matter out of analysing a book but I just can’t help it with this one. In the end, I think the book has something important to say and worth reading.This review originally appeared on my blog;http://literary-exploration.com/2013/...1980sbook-club-literary-explorationliterary-fiction...more11 likes6 commentsLikeCommentDisplaying 1 - 30 of 2,235 reviewsMore reviews and ratingsJoin the discussion16quotes19discussions7questionsCan't find what you're looking for?Get help and learn more about the design.Help center\n",

Set at an unspecified date in Earth's future, the novel presents an imperiled humankind after two conflicts with aninsectoidalien speciesthey dub \"thebuggers\". In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, Earth's international military force recruits young children, including the novel's protagonist,Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin, to be trained as elite officers. The children learn military strategy and leadership by playing increasingly difficultwar games, including some inzero gravity, where Ender'stacticalgeniusis revealed.The book originated as a short storyof the same name, published in the August 1977 issue ofAnalog Science Fiction and Fact.[1]The novel was published on January 15, 1985. Later, by elaborating on characters and plotlines depicted in the novel, Card wrote additional books in theEnder's Gameseries. Card released an updated version ofEnder's Gamein 1991, changing some political facts to account for the then-recentdissolution of the Soviet Unionand the end of theCold War. The novel has been translated into 34 languages.Reception of the book has been mostly positive. It has become suggested reading for many military organizations, including theUnited States Marine Corps.[2]Ender's Gamewas recognized as \"best novel\" by the 1985Nebula Award[3]and the 1986Hugo Award[4]in the genres of science fiction and fantasy. Its four sequels—Speaker for the Dead(1986),Xenocide(1991),Children of the Mind(1996),andEnder in Exile(2008)—follow Ender's subsequent travels to many different worlds in the galaxy. In addition, the later novellaA War of Gifts(2007) and novelEnder's Shadow(1999), plus other novels in theShadowsaga, take place during the same time period as the original.Afilm adaptation of the same name, written for the screen and directed byGavin Hood, and starringAsa Butterfieldas Ender, was released in October 2013. Card co-produced the film.[5]The novel has also been adapted intotwo comic book series.Retrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ender%27s_Game&oldid=1256823808\"Categories:1985 science fiction novelsAmerican young adult novels1985 American novelsNovels set in the 22nd century433 ErosAmerican novels adapted into filmsScience fiction novels adapted into filmsEnder's Game series booksHugo Award for Best Novel–winning worksMilitary science fiction novelsFiction about near-Earth asteroidsNebula Award for Best Novel–winning worksTor Books booksWorks about child soldiersWorks based on short fictionWorks originally published in Analog Science Fiction and FactFiction books about genocideFiction about space warfareYoung adult science fiction novelsHidden categories:CS1 errors: generic nameArticles with short descriptionShort description matches WikidataUse American English from December 2020All Wikipedia articles written in American EnglishGood articlesArticles containing Albanian-language textArticles containing Bulgarian-language textArticles containing Catalan-language textArticles containing Chinese-language textArticles containing Croatian-language textArticles containing Czech-language textArticles containing Danish-language textArticles containing Dutch-language textArticles containing Estonian-language textArticles containing Finnish-language textArticles containing French-language textArticles containing Galician-language textArticles containing Georgian-language textArticles containing German-language textArticles containing Greek-language textArticles containing Hebrew-language textArticles containing Hungarian-language textArticles containing Italian-language textArticles containing Japanese-language textArticles containing Korean-language textArticles containing Latvian-language textArticles containing Lithuanian-language textArticles containing Norwegian-language textArticles containing Persian-language textArticles containing Polish-language textArticles containing Portuguese-language textArticles containing Romanian-language textArticles containing Russian-language textArticles containing Slovene-language textArticles containing Serbian-language textArticles containing Spanish-language textArticles containing Swedish-language textArticles containing Thai-language textArticles containing Turkish-language textArticles containing Ukrainian-language textArticles containing Vietnamese-language textCommons category link from Wikidata\n",

Set on the coast of theSouth Islandof New Zealand, the novel focuses on three characters, all of whom are isolated in different ways: a reclusive artist, a mute child, and the child's foster father. Over the course of the novel the trio develop a tentative relationship, are driven apart by violence, and reunite.MāoriandPākehā(New Zealand European) culture, myths and language are blended through the novel. The novel has polarised critics and readers, with some praising the novel for its power and originality, while others have criticised Hulme's writing style and portrayals of violence.Hulme spent many years working on the novel, but was unable to find a mainstream publisher willing to accept the book without significant editing; it was eventually published by the small all-women collective,Spiral. After initial commercial success in New Zealand, the book was published overseas and became the first New Zealand novel and first debut novel to win theBooker Prizein 1985, although not without controversy; two of the five judges opposed the book's choice for its portrayals of child abuse and violence. Nevertheless, the novel has remained popular into the 21st century, continuing to sell well in New Zealand and overseas, and is widely recognised as a New Zealand literary classic.Retrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bone_People&oldid=1259086700\"Categories:20th-century New Zealand novels1984 novelsBooker Prize–winning worksNew Zealand speculative fiction worksWorks about Māori peopleHodder & Stoughton booksLouisiana State University Press booksMāori literatureHidden categories:Good articlesArticles with short descriptionShort description is different from WikidataUse dmy dates from December 2021Use New Zealand English from December 2021All Wikipedia articles written in New Zealand EnglishArticles containing Māori-language text\n",
