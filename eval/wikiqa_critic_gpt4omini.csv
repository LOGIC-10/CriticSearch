Q1881,who coined the term bucket list,"
The term ""bucket list"" was coined by screenwriter Justin Zackham while he was working on the screenplay for the 2007 film ""The Bucket List,"" which starred Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. The film revolves around two terminally ill men who escape from their hospital to fulfill a list of experiences they wish to complete before they ""kick the bucket,"" a colloquial expression meaning to die.

While Zackham is credited with popularizing the term, the concept of creating a list of things to do before one dies existed in various forms prior to the film's release. Notably, the phrase ""bucket list"" itself emerged in a few contexts before 2007, though these instances were not widely recognized. 

1. **Earlier References**: 
   - The phrase appeared in a 1993 report by the National Labor Relations Board, where it referred to agenda items that could not be addressed at a meeting, indicating a procedural context rather than a personal life list.
   - In 2004, the term was used in the book *Unfair & Unbalanced: The Lunatic Magniloquence of Henry E. Panky* by Patrick M. Carlisle, where it was contextually linked to life ambitions, marking its first usage in a context closer to its current meaning.

2. **Etymology of ""Kick the Bucket""**: 
   - The idiom ""kick the bucket,"" which means to die, has been in use since at least the late 18th century. It is believed that ""bucket list"" evolved from this expression, solidifying the connection between the idea of dying and the urgency to fulfill one's aspirations.

3. **Cultural Impact**: 
   - Zackham wrote a personal list titled ""Justin's List of Things to Do Before I Kick the Bucket,"" which he later shortened to ""Justin's Bucket List."" This initial list was a source of inspiration for the film's screenplay. The film's success significantly popularized the term ""bucket list,"" leading to its inclusion in major dictionaries like Merriam-Webster and the Oxford English Dictionary.

In summary, while Justin Zackham is credited with coining the term ""bucket list"" for the film, the concept had existed in various forms prior to 2007, and the term itself became widely recognized and popularized through the film's narrative and themes.
","The film opened in wide release in the United States and Canada on January 11, 2008 and was released in the United Kingdom on February 8, 2008, and in Australia on February 21, 2008.",0,0

Q1172,what part of the pre-world war 1 arms race was the most intense?,"
The most intense part of the pre-World War I arms race was the naval arms race between Germany and Great Britain, primarily occurring from 1898 to 1912. This period was characterized by fierce competition in naval construction and strategic developments, significantly driven by Germany's ambitions to challenge Britain's long-standing naval supremacy.

The naval arms race gained unprecedented momentum with the launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906, which redefined naval warfare. Dreadnought was the first battleship to feature an “all-big-gun” design with a uniform caliber of 12-inch guns, and it was also powered by steam turbines. This revolutionary design rendered all previous battleships obsolete, creating a sense of urgency among other nations, particularly Germany, to match Britain's naval advancements.

As Dreadnought set the new standard for battleships, Britain initially held a substantial lead, with seven Dreadnoughts and three battlecruisers by May 1910, while Germany had only completed its first two Dreadnoughts at that time. However, German Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz's strategic vision, which sought to build a fleet capable of posing a credible threat to British interests, led to a significant escalation in naval construction. The German naval laws enacted from 1898 onward aimed to increase the size and capability of the Imperial German Navy, with Tirpitz advocating for a fleet that could at least deter British naval power.

Public sentiment played a crucial role in both nations' naval policies. In Britain, the press and public opinion drove political leaders to respond aggressively to German naval expansions. The Liberal government, initially inclined to reduce defense spending, faced pressure to increase naval funding in light of the perceived threat from Germany, resulting in a rise in naval estimates and a commitment to build additional Dreadnoughts.

By 1914, Britain had commissioned 29 Dreadnoughts compared to Germany's 17, illustrating the intense competition that characterized this arms race. The rivalry was not merely quantitative; it also involved qualitative advancements in naval technology and strategy. The British focus on maintaining naval superiority was rooted in the nation's reliance on maritime trade and imperial interests, making any challenge to their naval dominance a matter of national security.

The naval arms race significantly influenced Anglo-German relations, fostering a climate of suspicion and hostility. As tensions escalated, attempts to negotiate limitations on naval expansion failed, leading to an environment where both nations felt compelled to continue their military build-up. This arms race intersected with broader militaristic trends in Europe, contributing to the overall climate of insecurity that precipitated the outbreak of World War I.

In conclusion, the naval arms race between Germany and Great Britain stands out as the most intense aspect of the pre-World War I arms competition. Its direct implications for international conflict and the visible strain it placed on diplomatic relations underscored its critical role in shaping the geopolitical landscape of the early 20th century. The interplay between these naval developments, national pride, and military strategy created a volatile environment that ultimately contributed to the war's outbreak.

Q1171,what materials are used for facial reconstruction,"
Facial reconstruction utilizes a variety of materials tailored to meet the specific needs of surgical procedures and patient outcomes. Below is an organized and updated overview of the materials used in facial reconstruction, incorporating feedback for conciseness and clarity:

### 1. Biocompatible Implants
These materials are designed to integrate well with human tissue.

- **Titanium**: Widely used in craniofacial plating systems for its strength, corrosion resistance, and excellent biocompatibility. While it promotes osseointegration, it can cause surrounding bone resorption due to the ""stress shielding effect."" Its visibility through thin skin layers may raise aesthetic concerns.

- **Polyetheretherketone (PEEK)**: Known for its high strength and compatibility with imaging modalities. PEEK can be customized during surgery for a precise fit. However, it has a slightly higher risk of infection compared to titanium.

### 2. Bone Grafts
Essential for reconstructive surgery, bone grafts can be autologous (from the patient), allogeneic (from a donor), or synthetic.

- **Cortical Bone Grafts**: Sourced from the calvarium or iliac crest, these provide structural support but can have unpredictable resorption rates.

- **Autologous Fat**: Harvested from other body areas, this can restore soft tissue volume but does not provide skeletal augmentation.

### 3. Resorbable Materials
These materials gradually break down in the body, often used temporarily during healing.

- **Polylactic Acid (PLA)** and **Polyglycolic Acid (PGA)**: Frequently used in plates and screws for fixation. They are beneficial for temporary support, minimizing the need for hardware removal.

### 4. Soft Tissue Fillers
Used for non-surgical facial rejuvenation:

- **Hyaluronic Acid**: Commonly used for filling wrinkles and enhancing contours, with results lasting several months.

- **Collagen**: Sometimes employed for soft tissue defects but less frequently than hyaluronic acid.

### 5. Synthetic Meshes and Membranes
Support soft tissue repair and guide bone regeneration.

- **Porous Polyethylene (MedPor)**: Known for low infection rates and tissue integration, MedPor is used in facial reconstruction, especially for microtia repair.

- **Hydroxyapatite (HaP)**: This bioceramic mimics bone and promotes healing. It is often combined with PLA to enhance stability. Recent advances in 3D printing technology are being explored for creating customized HaP-based implants.

### 6. Prosthetics
For cases where surgical reconstruction is not feasible, prosthetics can restore function and appearance.

- **Silicone and Acrylics**: Common materials for facial prostheses, known for their biocompatibility and ability to match skin color. However, they may need regular replacement due to wear.

### 7. Sutures and Adhesives
Various suturing materials (absorbable and non-absorbable) and tissue adhesives are used for wound closure, ensuring proper healing and alignment of tissues.

### Conclusion
The choice of materials in facial reconstruction depends on the specific surgical technique, the extent of reconstruction, and individual patient anatomy and health considerations. While titanium and PEEK are leading choices due to their mechanical properties, emerging technologies such as 3D printing of biocompatible materials present exciting future possibilities for tailored solutions in facial reconstruction.

Future advancements continue to emphasize reducing complications and improving aesthetic and functional outcomes, with ongoing research into integrating patient-specific needs and innovations in materials science.

Q849,how many people come over the border from mexico annually,"
The number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border annually has shown significant fluctuations in recent years. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), in fiscal year 2023, there were over **2 million encounters** with migrants crossing the border. This figure represents the total number of encounters, which may include individuals who were apprehended multiple times, rather than the unique number of individuals crossing.

This figure was a slight decrease from fiscal year 2022, where there were over **2.2 million encounters**. The end of 2023 saw an unprecedented spike, with approximately **250,000 encounters** recorded in December 2023 alone, marking the highest monthly total ever recorded.

However, the trend shifted significantly in 2024. By August, the number of encounters had sharply declined, with reports indicating around **58,038 encounters** for that month, reflecting a **77% drop** from December 2023. Further data shows that by September 2024, the encounters had decreased to approximately **54,000**, representing a **75.4% decrease** compared to September 2023.

It's important to note that ""encounters"" include both apprehensions and expulsions of migrants who cross without authorization, and the same individual can be counted multiple times if they attempt to cross again. Therefore, while the **2 million** figure for fiscal year 2023 gives a snapshot of border activity, it does not equate to the number of distinct individuals who crossed the border.

In summary, the annual figures for border crossings can vary greatly due to changing circumstances, enforcement policies, and other factors. Recent estimates indicate that over **2 million encounters** occurred in fiscal year 2023, but the landscape has shifted significantly in 2024 with a substantial decrease in encounters.

Q187,how does the book flatlands related to pre calc,"
The book ""Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions,"" written by Edwin A. Abbott in 1884, is intricately connected to pre-calculus, primarily through its exploration of geometric concepts and the nature of dimensions. This relationship can be more explicitly detailed, addressing the gaps highlighted in previous responses.

### Key Connections to Pre-Calculus:

1. **Understanding Dimensions**: 
   ""Flatland"" introduces readers to a two-dimensional world inhabited by geometric shapes. This foundational concept serves as a springboard to understanding higher dimensions, which is a significant topic in pre-calculus. The text illustrates how A. Square, a two-dimensional being, struggles to comprehend the existence of a third dimension. This struggle can help pre-calculus students grasp the concept of dimensions, emphasizing how our understanding can be limited by our perceived reality.

2. **Geometric Shapes and Properties**: 
   The novella's characters, such as lines, triangles, and squares, exemplify various geometric properties and relationships. In pre-calculus, students study the properties of these shapes, including angles, sides, and classifications (e.g., isosceles, equilateral). Abbott uses the square's perspective to explain how shapes with more sides (like pentagons and hexagons) symbolize higher intelligence and social status in ""Flatland."" This metaphor enhances students' understanding of the properties of polygons and their relationships, which is crucial in pre-calculus.

3. **Visualization of Higher Dimensions**: 
   ""Flatland"" serves as an imaginative tool for visualizing dimensions beyond the third. The book describes how A. Square perceives a three-dimensional sphere as a series of two-dimensional cross-sections (circles) at different points. This analogy aids pre-calculus students in understanding concepts like cross-sections and projections, which are foundational for further studies in calculus. The ability to visualize how a three-dimensional object can be represented in two dimensions is an important skill in mathematics.

4. **Introduction to Conic Sections**: 
   While ""Flatland"" does not explicitly detail conic sections, the exploration of higher dimensions and the transformation of shapes can lead to discussions about them. Conic sections—such as circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas—are crucial in pre-calculus. Understanding how shapes transform between dimensions can enhance students' ability to analyze and manipulate these figures, facilitating a deeper comprehension of their properties and equations. For instance, considering how a circle is a specific type of conic section can provide insight into its geometric properties and equations.

5. **Mathematical Logic and Reasoning**: 
   The challenges A. Square faces in conveying the existence of higher dimensions parallel the logical reasoning required in pre-calculus. Abbott’s narrative encourages critical thinking and logical reasoning—skills vital in mathematics. For example, when A. Square attempts to explain dimensionality to his fellow Flatlanders, his struggles reflect the necessity of clear reasoning and logical progression in solving mathematical problems. This can relate to how students must build upon foundational concepts to understand more complex ideas in mathematics.

### Conclusion:
In summary, ""Flatland"" serves as an engaging and imaginative approach to exploring key geometric concepts and the nature of dimensions, making it highly relevant to pre-calculus studies. By connecting the abstract ideas in ""Flatland"" with specific mathematical applications such as understanding geometric properties, visualizing higher dimensions, and introducing conic sections, the novella enhances student engagement and deepens their understanding of essential pre-calculus concepts. This makes ""Flatland"" not just a literary work, but also a valuable educational resource in the field of mathematics, fostering a richer understanding of the interconnectedness of geometry and dimensionality.

Q1110,when did the lutheran church began,"
The Lutheran Church began in the early 16th century, primarily associated with the teachings of Martin Luther, a German monk and theologian. The pivotal moment often cited is Luther's posting of his Ninety-Five Theses on October 31, 1517, in Wittenberg, Germany. This act is commonly regarded as the catalyst for the Protestant Reformation, which led to the establishment of various Protestant denominations, including Lutheranism. The formal establishment of the Lutheran Church as a distinct denomination occurred in the years following Luther's reforms, particularly with the Augsburg Confession in 1530, which outlined Lutheran beliefs and practices.

Q439,what does judgment as a matter of law mean,"
""Judgment as a matter of law"" (often referred to as ""JMOL"") is a legal term used in the context of civil and criminal trials. It refers to a situation where a judge rules that no reasonable jury could find in favor of one party based on the evidence presented during the trial. In essence, it means that the evidence overwhelmingly supports one side, making it unnecessary for the jury to deliberate on that issue.

JMOL can be requested by either party during a trial, typically after the opposing party has presented its case. If the judge grants the motion for judgment as a matter of law, the case is decided in favor of the moving party without the need for a jury decision on that specific issue. If the judge denies the motion, the case continues, and the jury will ultimately decide the matter.

This legal mechanism helps streamline the trial process by eliminating claims or defenses that lack sufficient evidentiary support. It is often invoked in situations where the evidence is clear-cut, making it a way to avoid unnecessary jury deliberation on issues that are not genuinely in dispute.
","However, in order to move for j.n.o.v., the movant must have moved for a JMOL before the verdict as well.",0,0

Q2770,when was library of congress built,"
The Library of Congress was established on April 24, 1800, when President John Adams approved an act of Congress that allocated $5,000 for the purchase of books to serve the legislative needs of Congress as it relocated from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. Initially, the collection was housed in the U.S. Capitol.

In 1814, during the War of 1812, the library suffered a significant setback when British forces burned the Capitol, destroying most of the collection. To rebuild, Congress purchased former President Thomas Jefferson's personal library of 6,487 volumes in 1815, which broadened the library's focus beyond mere legislative needs and laid the foundation for its future growth.

The original building specifically constructed for the Library, known as the Thomas Jefferson Building, opened to the public on November 1, 1897. This marked a significant milestone in the Library's history, providing it with a dedicated space for its expanding collections and services. The Library continued to grow, adding two more major buildings: the John Adams Building in 1939 and the James Madison Memorial Building in 1980.

Today, the Library of Congress is recognized as the largest library in the world, with over 170 million items in its collection, serving not just Congress but also the public and scholars alike.
