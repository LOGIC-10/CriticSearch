## ClassDef ReportEvaluation
**ReportEvaluation**: The function of ReportEvaluation is to evaluate a student report based on various benchmarks and generate scores for specific criteria such as breadth, depth, and factual accuracy.

**attributes**: 
· report_benchmark: An instance of the ReportBenchmark class used to obtain ground truth data for evaluation.
· student_report: A string representing the student's report that will be evaluated.

**Code Description**: 

The `ReportEvaluation` class is responsible for evaluating a student's report using predefined benchmarks. It takes an instance of `ReportBenchmark` and a student's report as input parameters and performs multiple evaluations based on these inputs.

- The `__init__` method initializes the class with two parameters: `report_benchmark` (an instance of the `ReportBenchmark` class) and `student_report` (a string containing the student’s report). It stores these inputs as instance attributes for use in the evaluation methods.
  
- The `examinees_outline_generation` method generates a student outline by interacting with the `ReportBenchmark`'s agent. This is achieved by loading a predefined template (`outline_generation.txt`), rendering it with relevant data (like the user query), and sending the generated prompt to the agent for processing. The response received from the agent is returned as the output.

- The `evaluate_breadth` method evaluates the breadth of the student's report by first generating a student tree using the `examinees_outline_generation` method. This student tree, which is returned as a string, is then parsed into a JSON object. The method calculates a similarity score between the benchmarked ground truth (breadth_gt) and the student tree structure using the `tree_similarity` function, which is returned as the final score.

- The `evaluate_factualqa` method performs an evaluation based on factual accuracy using the `student_report`. It loads a template (`factual_qa.txt`) from the `ReportBenchmark`'s agent, and renders it with necessary data (user query, breadth ground truth, and the student report). The rendered prompt is passed to the agent, and the agent's response is returned.

- The `extract_student_tree_structure` method extracts the structure of the student's report in terms of its logical structure (tree format). It loads a template (`student_tree_extraction.txt`) and renders it with the `student_report` data. The agent's response is expected to return a structured JSON representation of the student's report outline.

- The `evaluate_depth` method is intended to evaluate the depth of the student’s report based on factual accuracy results. However, the implementation for this logic is currently not provided in the code. The method seems to focus on extracting accuracy metrics from the factual QA results and calculating an associated score, but the actual logic is left unimplemented.

**Note**: 
- The class relies heavily on the `ReportBenchmark` instance and its associated agent for template rendering and interactions. The templates used for evaluation are required to exist (e.g., `outline_generation.txt`, `factual_qa.txt`, `student_tree_extraction.txt`).
- The `evaluate_breadth` and `evaluate_factualqa` methods assume that the agent's responses will be returned in a format that can be processed (i.e., JSON format for the student tree).
- The `evaluate_depth` method is a placeholder and needs implementation to provide a meaningful evaluation based on factual QA results.

**Output Example**:
- The output of `examinees_outline_generation` could be a response like:
  ```
  {
    "outline": [
      {"section": "Introduction", "content": "Introduction to the topic."},
      {"section": "Main Content", "content": "Detailed explanation of the topic."},
      {"section": "Conclusion", "content": "Summary of findings."}
    ]
  }
  ```
- The output of `evaluate_breadth` could be a numeric score such as:
  ```
  0.85
  ```
- The output of `evaluate_factualqa` could be a factual accuracy score or response like:
  ```
  "The student report contains 80% factual accuracy based on the evaluation."
  ```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, report_benchmark, student_report)
### `__init__` Method

The `__init__` method is the constructor for the `ReportEvaluation` class. It initializes the object with the necessary attributes to perform a report evaluation by accepting two parameters: `report_benchmark` and `student_report`. This method serves the purpose of setting up the initial state of the evaluation process by assigning these parameters to class attributes.

#### Parameters:
- **`report_benchmark`** (`ReportBenchmark`): This parameter is an instance of the `ReportBenchmark` class, which provides the necessary ground truths for the report evaluation. The `ReportBenchmark` instance contains the reference for the comparison and analysis of the report's accuracy and quality.
  
- **`student_report`** (`str`): This parameter is a string that represents the student's report to be evaluated. It contains the content of the report submitted by the student, which will be compared against the benchmark generated by `ReportBenchmark`.

#### Attributes:
- **`self.report_benchmark`**: An instance of the `ReportBenchmark` class that is used to access the benchmark data (ground truths) required for evaluation.
  
- **`self.student_report`**: A string containing the student's report. This will be evaluated based on the benchmark provided by `ReportBenchmark`.

#### Purpose:
The `__init__` method is primarily responsible for setting up the objects and data required for the report evaluation. It prepares the system by taking in the benchmark data (via `report_benchmark`) and the student's report (via `student_report`) for comparison. These attributes will be used by other methods in the class to perform detailed evaluations, such as assessing factual accuracy, report completeness, and more.

### FunctionDef examinees_outline_generation(self)
## Function: `examinees_outline_generation`

### Overview:
The `examinees_outline_generation` function is responsible for generating an outline related to examinees based on a predefined template. It integrates with the `ReportBenchmark` class to load a template, format it with relevant data, and then use an agent to generate a response. This response is used to provide an outline that may assist in organizing or understanding examinee-related data.

### Method Signature:
```python
def examinees_outline_generation(self)
```

### Parameters:
This method does not take any external parameters. It operates on the internal state of the object.

### Returns:
- **response** (str): The generated response from the agent after rendering the template and processing it.

### Detailed Description:
The `examinees_outline_generation` method follows a series of steps to generate the desired outline:

1. **Template Loading**: It starts by loading a template file named `"outline_generation.txt"` from the `ReportBenchmark` agent using the `load_template` function. This template file is expected to contain predefined structure or placeholders for the outline content.

2. **Template Rendering**: The method creates a data dictionary containing the `user_query` from the `ReportBenchmark` instance. This dictionary is passed along with the template string to the `render_template` function, which processes the template by replacing placeholders with the values from the data dictionary.

3. **Generating Response**: After the template is rendered, the resulting prompt is sent to the agent's `common_chat` function. This function processes the prompt and generates a response, which is then returned by the `examinees_outline_generation` method.

### Example Usage:
```python
response = self.examinees_outline_generation()
```

In this example, calling `examinees_outline_generation()` would initiate the process of generating the examinee outline and return the corresponding response.

### Dependencies:
- **`ReportBenchmark`**: The method relies on the `ReportBenchmark` class for accessing the `user_query` and interacting with the agent.
- **`load_template`**: Used to load the template file `"outline_generation.txt"`.
- **`render_template`**: Formats the template using the provided data.
- **`common_chat`**: Used to process the formatted prompt and generate the final response.

This method is designed to provide a structured and dynamic way to generate outlines for examinee-related content based on the data available in the system.

### FunctionDef evaluate_breadth(self)
**evaluate_breadth**: The function of evaluate_breadth is to calculate the similarity score between a generated student tree and a benchmark tree based on their structural and semantic alignment.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: None - This method does not take any external parameters.

**Code Description**: The `evaluate_breadth` function is a method within the `ReportEvaluation` class that serves to assess the breadth of a student's understanding as represented in a tree structure. The function operates by first invoking the `examinees_outline_generation` method, which generates a string representation of a student tree based on a predefined template. This string is then parsed into a JSON object to create a structured tree format.

Once the student tree is constructed, the function proceeds to compare it against a benchmark tree, which is stored in the `breadth_gt` attribute of the `report_benchmark` object. This comparison is performed using the `tree_similarity` function, which calculates a similarity score based on the hierarchical and semantic alignment of the two trees. The final score is then returned as the output of the `evaluate_breadth` method.

The relationship with its callees is significant: `examinees_outline_generation` is responsible for generating the student tree, while `tree_similarity` is tasked with evaluating the similarity between the generated tree and the benchmark tree. This method is crucial for the overall evaluation process, as it quantifies how closely the student's representation aligns with the expected standard.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `examinees_outline_generation` method successfully generates a valid tree structure before calling `tree_similarity`, as the accuracy of the similarity score depends on the integrity of both the student tree and the benchmark tree.

**Output Example**: The function may return a similarity score such as 0.85, indicating a high degree of alignment between the student tree and the benchmark tree.

### FunctionDef evaluate_factualqa(self)
## Function: `evaluate_factualqa`

### Overview:
The `evaluate_factualqa` function is responsible for performing a factual question answering (FactualQA) evaluation based on the provided student report and associated benchmark data. It loads a predefined template, populates it with relevant data, and uses this template to generate a prompt. The prompt is then processed by a chat agent to generate a response, which is returned as the evaluation result.

### Method Signature:
```python
def evaluate_factualqa(self)
```

### Parameters:
This method does not accept any parameters directly, as it operates based on attributes of the instance it belongs to.

### Returns:
- **str**: The response generated by the chat agent, which represents the outcome of the FactualQA evaluation.

### Detailed Description:
The `evaluate_factualqa` function follows these steps:
1. It loads a template file (`factual_qa.txt`) from the agent's predefined template repository.
2. It prepares a dictionary containing the following keys:
   - **`Query`**: The user query, retrieved from `self.report_benchmark.user_query`.
   - **`BreadthGT`**: The ground truth data related to breadth, serialized as a JSON string using `self.report_benchmark.breadth_gt`.
   - **`DepthGT`**: The student's report, stored in `self.student_report`.
3. The function then uses the `render_template` method to render the template with the provided data, creating a formatted prompt.
4. This rendered prompt is sent to the chat agent through the `common_chat` method for processing.
5. Finally, the response returned by the chat agent is returned as the result of the evaluation.

### Example Usage:
```python
evaluation_result = self.evaluate_factualqa()
```

In this example, the `evaluate_factualqa` method is called, and the result of the FactualQA evaluation is returned as a string, which can then be used for further analysis or output.

### Dependencies:
This method depends on several components:
- **`self.report_benchmark`**: Contains the `user_query`, `breadth_gt`, and an agent responsible for template handling and rendering.
- **`self.student_report`**: The student’s report used for the Depth ground truth in the evaluation.
- **`load_template`**: Used to load the `factual_qa.txt` template file.
- **`render_template`**: Used to format the template with dynamic data.
- **`common_chat`**: The method used to process the prompt and generate the final response. 

### Example Flow:
1. The method loads the template `factual_qa.txt`.
2. It prepares a data dictionary containing user query, breadth ground truth, and the student's report.
3. The template is rendered with the provided data.
4. The prompt is sent to the agent, which processes it and generates the evaluation response.
5. The final response is returned to the caller.

### FunctionDef extract_student_tree_structure(self)
**extract_student_tree_structure**: The function of extract_student_tree_structure is to extract the logical structure of a directory tree from a student report.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The extract_student_tree_structure function is designed to facilitate the extraction of a structured representation of a student's report. It begins by loading a template file named "student_tree_extraction.txt" using the load_template method from the report_benchmark.agent. This template serves as a blueprint for how the data from the student report should be formatted and presented.

Next, the function prepares a data dictionary containing the key "StudentReport" mapped to the instance variable self.student_report, which holds the actual report data. This dictionary is then passed to the render_template method, which processes the template string and replaces any placeholders with the corresponding values from the data dictionary. The rendered output is a prompt that is tailored to the specific structure of the student report.

Following this, the function invokes the common_chat method, passing the rendered prompt as the usr_prompt parameter. This method is responsible for sending the prompt to a conversational model and receiving a response. The response is expected to be in a JSON format, which is then parsed using json.loads before being returned by the extract_student_tree_structure function.

This function is integral to the ReportEvaluation class, as it allows for the systematic extraction of information from student reports, enabling further analysis or evaluation based on the structured data obtained.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the "student_tree_extraction.txt" template file exists in the specified directory, as the load_template method will raise a FileNotFoundError if the file is missing. Additionally, the response from the common_chat method should be in a valid JSON format to avoid errors during parsing.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the extract_student_tree_structure function could be a structured JSON object representing the hierarchy of the student report, such as:
{
    "title": "Student Report",
    "sections": [
        {
            "title": "Introduction",
            "content": "This section introduces the report."
        },
        {
            "title": "Results",
            "content": "This section presents the results."
        }
    ]
}
***
### FunctionDef evaluate_depth(self)
**evaluate_depth**: The function of evaluate_depth is to perform an evaluation of the depth based on the factual QA results to calculate the final score, specifically focusing on the accuracy of student report-based answers.

**parameters**: 
- None

**Code Description**: 
The `evaluate_depth` function currently does not implement any logic. It is intended to evaluate the depth based on the factual question-answering (QA) results, focusing on calculating the accuracy (ACC) of student report-based answers. However, the function body contains only a `pass` statement, which indicates that the logic for depth evaluation has not been implemented yet. 

The comment inside the function suggests that once implemented, it would extract the accuracy of the answers derived from student reports and use this accuracy to compute a final score. This functionality is related to assessing the quality or correctness of the answers provided by students in reports, but the actual evaluation mechanism is absent in the code at this point.

**Note**: 
- The function does not currently perform any operations or return any values due to the absence of an implementation.
- Future implementations of this function are expected to involve extracting and evaluating accuracy metrics based on student-provided answers in reports.
