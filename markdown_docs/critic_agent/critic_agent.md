## ClassDef CriticAgent
**CriticAgent**: The function of CriticAgent is to generate critiques based on user questions and agent responses.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· original_task: A string that holds the original user question or task to be critiqued.  
· critic_prompt: A template used for generating critiques, retrieved from the environment.  
· agent_answer: A string that stores the answer provided by the agent for critique.  

**Code Description**: The CriticAgent class inherits from the BaseAgent class and is designed to facilitate the process of generating critiques for agent responses. Upon initialization, it sets up an empty string for the original task and retrieves a template for the critique from the environment. The main functionality of this class is encapsulated in the `critic` method, which generates a critique based on the original task and the agent's answer.

The `critic` method first gathers the necessary data by calling `get_data_for_critic`, which compiles the original task and the agent's answer into a dictionary. This data is then passed to the `chat_with_template` method along with the critique prompt to simulate a conversation where the model acts as a user providing a response. The generated response is appended to the history with the role of "critic_user".

After obtaining the model's response, the method attempts to extract and validate the response as YAML format using the `extract_and_validate_yaml` method. If the response is valid YAML, it is returned; otherwise, an error message is printed, and the method returns None.

The `receive_agent_answer` method allows the class to accept an answer from the agent, storing it in the `agent_answer` attribute. The `get_data_for_critic` method constructs a dictionary containing the original task and the agent's answer, which is essential for generating the critique.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the agent's answer is properly formatted and relevant to the original task for the critique to be meaningful. Additionally, users should handle potential YAML parsing errors gracefully.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `critic` method could be a structured YAML response such as:
```yaml
critique:
  feedback: "The agent's response was clear and concise."
  suggestions:
    - "Consider providing more examples."
    - "Clarify the main points for better understanding."
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the CriticAgent class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method that is called when an instance of the CriticAgent class is created. It first invokes the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, it initializes an instance variable `original_task` to an empty string, which is likely intended to hold a description or identifier of the task that the agent will be working on. Additionally, it initializes another instance variable `critic_prompt` by calling `self.env.get_template('critic_agent.txt')`. This line suggests that the CriticAgent class is associated with an environment that can retrieve templates, and it specifically loads a template named 'critic_agent.txt'. This template may be used later in the class for generating prompts or responses related to the critic agent's functionality.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the environment (`self.env`) is properly set up before this constructor is called, as it relies on the `get_template` method to function correctly. Additionally, the `original_task` variable should be assigned a meaningful value before it is used in any operations to avoid issues with uninitialized data.

### FunctionDef critic(self)
**critic**: The function of critic is to generate a review based on user input and agent response.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The critic method is a member of the CriticAgent class and is responsible for generating a critique based on the interaction between the user and the agent. It begins by calling the get_data_for_critic method, which retrieves the original user question and the agent's answer in a structured format. This data is essential for creating a meaningful critique.

Once the data is obtained, the method utilizes the chat_with_template function, passing in the retrieved data along with a predefined prompt stored in self.critic_prompt. This function is expected to simulate a conversation where the model generates a response based on the provided input.

The response from chat_with_template is then appended to the instance variable self.history, with the role labeled as "critic_user". This allows for tracking the conversation history, which may be useful for future reference or analysis.

Following this, the method attempts to extract and validate the response as YAML formatted content using the extract_and_validate_yaml function. If the response is valid YAML, it is returned by the critic method. However, if a yaml.YAMLError occurs during this process, an error message is printed to the console indicating that the YAML content is invalid, and the method returns None.

The critic method thus plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the CriticAgent class by facilitating the generation of critiques based on user-agent interactions, ensuring that the critiques are formatted correctly and maintaining a history of the interactions.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the instance variables self.original_task, self.agent_answer, and self.critic_prompt are properly initialized before calling this function to avoid returning None or causing errors in the subsequent processing.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the critic method could be a well-structured YAML representation of the critique, such as:
```yaml
review:
  feedback: "The agent's response was accurate and concise."
  suggestions:
    - "Consider providing more examples."
    - "Clarify the context of the question."
```

### FunctionDef receive_agent_answer(self, agent_answer)
**receive_agent_answer**: The function of receive_agent_answer is to store the answer provided by an agent.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· agent_answer: This parameter represents the answer received from an agent, which is expected to be of any data type that can be assigned to the instance variable.

**Code Description**: The receive_agent_answer function is a method defined within the CriticAgent class. Its primary purpose is to accept an input parameter named agent_answer and assign this value to an instance variable also named agent_answer. This method effectively allows the CriticAgent instance to store the response from an agent for later use or reference. The assignment operation is straightforward, ensuring that whatever value is passed to the function is directly saved as part of the object's state.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the agent_answer parameter is provided in the correct format expected by the application, as this method does not perform any validation or type checking on the input. The stored value can be accessed later through the instance variable, which may be used in further processing or decision-making within the CriticAgent class.

### FunctionDef get_data_for_critic(self)
**get_data_for_critic**: The function of get_data_for_critic is to retrieve the original user question and the agent's answer in a structured format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The get_data_for_critic function is a method within the CriticAgent class that returns a dictionary containing two key pieces of information: 'user_question' and 'agent_answer'. The value for 'user_question' is obtained from the instance variable self.original_task, which presumably holds the question posed by the user. The value for 'agent_answer' is derived from another instance variable, self.agent_answer, which likely contains the response generated by the agent to the user's question.

This function is called within the critic method of the same class. The critic method is responsible for generating a review or critique based on the interaction between the user and the agent. It first calls get_data_for_critic to gather the necessary data, which is then used to create a model response through the chat_with_template method. The output from chat_with_template is expected to be in a YAML format, which is subsequently validated and formatted. If the YAML content is invalid, an error is caught, and a message is printed.

Thus, get_data_for_critic plays a crucial role in providing the foundational data needed for the critique process, ensuring that the user question and agent's answer are readily accessible for further processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the instance variables self.original_task and self.agent_answer are properly initialized before calling this function to avoid returning None or causing errors in the subsequent processing.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from get_data_for_critic could look like this:
{
    'user_question': 'What is the capital of France?',
    'agent_answer': 'The capital of France is Paris.'
}
