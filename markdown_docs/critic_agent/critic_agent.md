## ClassDef CriticAgent
**CriticAgent**: The function of CriticAgent is to generate critiques based on user questions and agent responses.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· original_task: A string that holds the user's original question or task.
· critic_prompt: A template used for generating critiques, retrieved from the environment.
· agent_answer: A string that stores the answer provided by the agent.

**Code Description**: The CriticAgent class inherits from the BaseAgent class and is designed to facilitate the generation of critiques for agent responses to user questions. Upon initialization, it sets up the original task as an empty string and retrieves a template for critiques from the environment, specifically from a file named 'critic_agent.txt'. 

The class contains several methods:
- The `__init__` method initializes the instance of the CriticAgent, setting up the original task and loading the critique template.
- The `critic` method is responsible for generating a critique. It first gathers the necessary data by calling the `get_data_for_critic` method, which collects the user's question and the agent's answer. It then utilizes the `chat_with_template` method to interact with the critique template and obtain a response from the model. The response is expected to be in YAML format, which is validated and formatted. If the response contains invalid YAML, an error message is printed, and the method returns None.
- The `receive_agent_answer` method allows the CriticAgent to store the agent's answer for later critique.
- The `get_data_for_critic` method constructs and returns a dictionary containing the original user question and the agent's answer, which is essential for generating the critique.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the agent's answer is properly received before invoking the `critic` method, as the critique generation relies on this data. Additionally, users should handle potential YAML errors gracefully when utilizing the `critic` method.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `critic` method could be a formatted YAML string such as:
```yaml
critique:
  - feedback: "The response was clear and concise."
  - suggestions:
      - "Consider providing more examples."
      - "Ensure to address all parts of the user's question."
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the CriticAgent class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method that is called when an instance of the CriticAgent class is created. It first invokes the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, it initializes an instance variable `original_task` to an empty string, which is likely intended to hold a description or identifier of the task that the agent will be working on. Additionally, it initializes another instance variable `critic_prompt` by calling `self.env.get_template('critic_agent.txt')`. This line suggests that the CriticAgent class is associated with an environment that can retrieve templates, and it specifically loads a template named 'critic_agent.txt'. This template may be used later in the class for generating prompts or responses related to the critic agent's functionality.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the environment (`self.env`) is properly set up before this constructor is called, as it relies on the `get_template` method to function correctly. Additionally, the `original_task` variable should be assigned a meaningful value before it is used in any operations to avoid issues with uninitialized data.

### FunctionDef critic(self)
**critic**: The function of critic is to generate a review based on user input and agent responses.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The critic method is a member of the CriticAgent class, responsible for producing a critique based on the interaction between the user and the agent. It begins by invoking the get_data_for_critic method, which retrieves essential data in the form of a dictionary containing the user's question and the agent's answer. This data is then passed to the chat_with_template method along with a predefined prompt (self.critic_prompt) to generate a model response.

The expected output from chat_with_template is a string formatted in YAML. The critic method subsequently attempts to validate and format this YAML content using the extract_and_validate_yaml method. If the YAML content is valid, it is returned as the output of the critic method. However, if a YAMLError occurs during this validation process, an error message is printed to the console, and the method returns None.

The relationship between critic and its callees is crucial for its functionality. The get_data_for_critic method provides the necessary context for the critique by supplying the user question and agent answer. The chat_with_template method is responsible for generating the critique based on this context, while extract_and_validate_yaml ensures that the output is in a valid format. This structured flow ensures that the critique process is both systematic and reliable.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the instance variables self.original_task and self.agent_answer are properly initialized before calling this function to avoid returning None or causing errors in the subsequent processing.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the critic method could be a well-structured YAML string, such as:
```yaml
review:
  user_question: "What is the capital of France?"
  agent_answer: "The capital of France is Paris."
  critique: "The answer is accurate and concise."
```

### FunctionDef receive_agent_answer(self, agent_answer)
**receive_agent_answer**: The function of receive_agent_answer is to store the answer provided by an agent.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· agent_answer: This parameter represents the answer received from an agent, which is expected to be of any data type that can be assigned to the instance variable.

**Code Description**: The receive_agent_answer function is a method defined within the CriticAgent class. Its primary purpose is to accept an input parameter named agent_answer and assign this value to an instance variable also named agent_answer. This method effectively allows the CriticAgent instance to store the response from an agent for later use or reference. The assignment operation is straightforward, ensuring that whatever value is passed to the function is directly saved as part of the object's state.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the agent_answer parameter is provided in the correct format expected by the application, as this method does not perform any validation or type checking on the input. The stored value can be accessed later through the instance variable, which may be used in further processing or decision-making within the CriticAgent class.

### FunctionDef get_data_for_critic(self)
**get_data_for_critic**: The function of get_data_for_critic is to retrieve the original user question and the agent's answer in a structured format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The get_data_for_critic function is a method within the CriticAgent class that returns a dictionary containing two key pieces of information: 'user_question' and 'agent_answer'. The value for 'user_question' is obtained from the instance variable self.original_task, which presumably holds the question posed by the user. The value for 'agent_answer' is derived from another instance variable, self.agent_answer, which likely contains the response generated by the agent to the user's question.

This function is called within the critic method of the same class. The critic method is responsible for generating a review or critique based on the interaction between the user and the agent. It first calls get_data_for_critic to gather the necessary data, which is then used to create a model response through the chat_with_template method. The output from chat_with_template is expected to be in a YAML format, which is subsequently validated and formatted. If the YAML content is invalid, an error is caught, and a message is printed.

Thus, get_data_for_critic plays a crucial role in providing the foundational data needed for the critique process, ensuring that the user question and agent's answer are readily accessible for further processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the instance variables self.original_task and self.agent_answer are properly initialized before calling this function to avoid returning None or causing errors in the subsequent processing.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from get_data_for_critic could look like this:
{
    'user_question': 'What is the capital of France?',
    'agent_answer': 'The capital of France is Paris.'
}
