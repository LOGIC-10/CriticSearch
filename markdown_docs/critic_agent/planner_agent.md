## ClassDef SearchPlanAgent
**SearchPlanAgent**: The function of SearchPlanAgent is to generate a structured plan based on user input and feedback.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· original_task: A string that holds the initial task provided by the user.
· reflection_and_plan_prompt: A template used for generating the planning response, retrieved from the environment.

**Code Description**: The SearchPlanAgent class inherits from the BaseAgent class and is designed to facilitate the planning process by generating a structured response based on user input. Upon initialization, it sets the original_task attribute to an empty string and retrieves a template for planning that includes reflection. The main functionality of this class is encapsulated in the plan method, which generates a plan by first gathering necessary data through the get_data_for_plan method. This data includes the user's question, the agent's previous answer, user feedback, and the search history. The method then interacts with a chat model using the reflection_and_plan_prompt template to obtain a response. The response is expected to be in YAML format, which is validated and formatted. If the response contains invalid YAML, an error message is printed, and the method returns None. The get_data_for_plan method serves as a utility to compile the relevant data into a dictionary format for use in the planning process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the YAML response from the chat model is correctly formatted to avoid errors during validation. Users should also be aware that the original_task must be set prior to calling the plan method for meaningful output.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the plan method could be:
```yaml
plan:
  - step: "Define the objectives"
    details: "Clarify what needs to be achieved."
  - step: "Gather resources"
    details: "Identify and collect necessary materials."
  - step: "Execute the plan"
    details: "Implement the steps outlined in the plan."
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the SearchPlanAgent class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the SearchPlanAgent class. It begins by calling the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__()`, which ensures that any initialization defined in the parent class is executed. This is a common practice in object-oriented programming to maintain the integrity of the inheritance chain. 

Following the parent class initialization, the function initializes an instance variable `original_task` as an empty string. This variable is likely intended to hold the original task that the agent will work with, although its specific usage will depend on the broader context of the class.

Additionally, the function sets up another instance variable `reflection_and_plan_prompt` by retrieving a template from the environment using `self.env.get_template('planner_agent_with_reflection.txt')`. This suggests that the SearchPlanAgent class is designed to work with templates, possibly for generating prompts or instructions related to planning and reflection tasks. The template file 'planner_agent_with_reflection.txt' is expected to be present in the environment, and its contents will be used later in the class's operations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parent class is correctly defined and that the template file exists in the specified location to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the purpose and usage of the `original_task` variable should be clearly defined in the broader context of the class to ensure proper functionality.

### FunctionDef plan(self)
**plan**: The function of plan is to generate a structured plan in YAML format based on the data retrieved and processed.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The plan function is responsible for generating a plan by following a specific sequence of operations. Initially, it calls the method `get_data_for_critic()` to retrieve the necessary data that will be used for planning. This data is then passed to the method `chat_with_template()`, along with a predefined prompt called `reflection_and_plan_prompt`, which likely guides the generation of the response based on the input data.

After obtaining the response from the model, the function attempts to extract and validate the YAML content using the method `extract_and_validate_yaml()`. This method is expected to parse the model's response and ensure that it conforms to the YAML format. If the extraction and validation are successful, the function returns the formatted YAML content.

In the event that there is an error during the YAML extraction or validation process, specifically a `yaml.YAMLError`, the function catches this exception and prints an error message indicating that the YAML content is invalid. In such cases, the function returns `None`, indicating that the planning process could not be completed successfully.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the data returned from `get_data_for_critic()` is in the expected format for the subsequent processing steps. Additionally, proper error handling is implemented to manage potential issues with YAML formatting.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a string representing a valid YAML structure, such as:

```yaml
plan:
  - step: "Initialize the system"
    duration: "5 minutes"
  - step: "Gather data"
    duration: "10 minutes"
  - step: "Analyze data"
    duration: "15 minutes"
``` 

If an error occurs during the YAML extraction, the function would return `None`.

### FunctionDef get_data_for_plan(self)
**get_data_for_plan**: The function of get_data_for_plan is to compile and return essential data related to the user's interaction with the agent.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The get_data_for_plan function is a method that retrieves and organizes key pieces of information from the instance of the class it belongs to. It returns a dictionary containing four specific fields: 
- 'user_question': This field holds the original task or question posed by the user, which is stored in the instance variable self.original_task.
- 'agent_answer': This field contains the response generated by the agent in relation to the user's question, accessed through the instance variable self.agent_answer.
- 'user_feedback': This field captures any feedback provided by the user regarding the agent's response, retrieved from the instance variable self.user_feedback.
- 'search_history': This field includes a record of the user's previous queries or interactions, which is stored in the instance variable self.search_history.

The function effectively consolidates these elements into a single dictionary, facilitating easy access to the relevant data for further processing or analysis.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the instance variables (self.original_task, self.agent_answer, self.user_feedback, self.search_history) are properly initialized before calling this function to avoid returning None or causing errors.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    'user_question': 'What is the weather like today?',
    'agent_answer': 'The weather today is sunny with a high of 75°F.',
    'user_feedback': 'This answer is helpful, thank you!',
    'search_history': ['What is the weather like today?', 'Tell me about tomorrow\'s forecast.']
}
