## ClassDef ReportBenchmark
**ReportBenchmark**: The function of ReportBenchmark is to generate benchmark evaluations for reports by processing input data, performing fact extraction, running factual question answering, and optionally visualizing the results.

**attributes**:
· json_path: Path to the input JSON file.
· agent: Instance of BaseAgent used for rendering prompts and handling communication with the model.
· breadth_gt: Ground truth representing the breadth of the report, extracted from the input JSON.
· article_content: The content of the report, extracted from the input file.
· sections: List of sections in the article, parsed from the markdown content.
· user_query: A query string for generating a comprehensive report about the breadth ground truth.

**Code Description**:  
The `ReportBenchmark` class is designed to assist in the evaluation of reports through a series of steps that include extracting data, querying models, and presenting results. The class interacts with an external `BaseAgent` instance, which is used to render prompts and handle the communication with a model (such as GPT-4).

- The `__init__` method initializes the class by taking a JSON input file path and an optional user query. It processes the input file to extract both the breadth ground truth (a structured JSON representation of the report) and the article's content (extracted from markdown format). The sections of the article are parsed from the markdown content, and if no user query is provided, a default query is generated based on the title from the breadth ground truth.

- The `run_fact_extraction` method performs the fact extraction for each section of the report. It calls a helper function `process_section`, which uses a retry mechanism (attempting up to 10 times) to send each section's content to the model for fact extraction. The method returns a list of extracted facts for each section.

- The `run_factualqa` method prepares a query to evaluate the factual accuracy of the report using the breadth ground truth and an optional depth ground truth. It loads and renders a specific template for factual question answering, then passes the generated prompt to the model via the `common_chat` method of the `BaseAgent`. The result of the evaluation is returned.

- The `generate_benchmark_item` method combines the fact extraction and factual evaluation steps to build a full benchmark item. It calls `run_fact_extraction` to retrieve fact extraction results and then processes these results into a table format using the `parse_tagged_data_to_table` method. If visualization is requested, it generates a DataFrame from the parsed data and exports it as a CSV file. It returns a dictionary containing the title of the report, the breadth ground truth, and the fact extraction results.

- The `parse_tagged_data_to_table` method is used to process the fact extraction results. It expects the input to be a list of strings containing tagged data (e.g., questions, answers, and format descriptions). It extracts the relevant information from each entry and returns it in a table format (list of dictionaries). If a CSV path is provided, the table is saved as a CSV file.

- The `verify_extraction_meaningful` method, which is not yet implemented, is meant to verify if the fact extraction results are meaningful and correct.

The `ReportBenchmark` class is called by other parts of the project, such as in `report_evaluation.py` where an instance of `ReportBenchmark` is used in conjunction with a `student_report` to compare and evaluate a student's report against the generated benchmark.

**Note**: The `ReportBenchmark` class relies on the `BaseAgent` class for interacting with models, and its functionality is highly dependent on how the model responds to the prompts. If a section fails to be processed after multiple attempts, it is skipped with a warning. The `verify_extraction_meaningful` method is currently a placeholder and has not been implemented.

**Output Example**:
An example return value from `generate_benchmark_item` might look like this:

```python
{
    "title": "Comprehensive Report on Environmental Impact",
    "breadth_gt": {
        "title": "Comprehensive Report on Environmental Impact",
        "sections": [...]
    },
    "fact_extraction": [
        [
            {"Question": "What is the environmental impact of deforestation?", "Format": "Short answer", "Answer": "Deforestation contributes to habitat loss and increased carbon emissions."},
            {"Question": "How can we mitigate deforestation?", "Format": "Short answer", "Answer": "Reforestation and sustainable forestry practices are key methods."}
        ],
        [
            {"Question": "What is the carbon footprint of industrialization?", "Format": "Short answer", "Answer": "Industrialization increases carbon emissions significantly."},
            {"Question": "How can industrialization reduce its carbon footprint?", "Format": "Short answer", "Answer": "By adopting green technologies and energy-efficient processes."}
        ]
    ]
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, json_input_path, user_query)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the ReportBenchmark class, setting up necessary attributes and processing input data.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· json_input_path: A string representing the file path to the input JSON file that contains the data to be processed.
· user_query: An optional string that allows the user to specify a custom query for report generation.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is the constructor for the ReportBenchmark class. It is responsible for initializing the instance by setting up various attributes and processing the input data provided through the parameters. 

When an instance of ReportBenchmark is created, the method takes two parameters: json_input_path and an optional user_query. The json_input_path is used to specify the location of a JSON file that contains the data necessary for generating a report. The user_query parameter allows for customization of the report generation prompt; if it is not provided, a default query is generated based on the title extracted from the JSON data.

The method begins by assigning the json_input_path to the instance variable self.json_path. It then creates an instance of the BaseAgent class, which is stored in self.agent. The BaseAgent class serves as a foundational component for managing conversations and performing searches, which may be utilized later in the report generation process.

Next, the method calls the extractDirectoryTree function, passing the json_input_path as an argument. This function processes the JSON file to extract a breadth ground truth structure, which is then stored in the instance variable self.breadth_gt. The extractDirectoryTree function is crucial as it constructs a hierarchical representation of the data, filtering out unnecessary nodes based on specific criteria.

Following this, the method calls extractMarkdownContent with the json_input_path to read the content of the JSON file and convert it into a markdown format. The resulting markdown content is stored in self.article_content. This content is essential for generating the report as it provides the textual basis from which sections can be derived.

The method then calls extract_markdown_sections, passing the article content to extract distinct sections based on header lines in the markdown text. The extracted sections are stored in self.sections, which can be utilized later for report generation.

Finally, the user_query is processed. If it is not provided, a default query is generated that requests a comprehensive report based on the title found in the breadth ground truth. This default query is constructed using the title extracted from self.breadth_gt, ensuring that the report generation is contextually relevant.

Overall, the __init__ method establishes the foundational elements required for the ReportBenchmark instance to function effectively, setting up the necessary data structures and preparing for subsequent operations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input JSON file is correctly formatted and contains the necessary fields for the extractDirectoryTree and extractMarkdownContent functions to operate as expected. Any inconsistencies in the data may lead to errors during processing.

### FunctionDef run_fact_extraction(self)
**run_fact_extraction**: The function of run_fact_extraction is to extract facts from sections of markdown text by using the fact extraction agent in a parallelized manner and returning a list of extracted facts for each section.

**parameters**:
· None

**Code Description**: 
The `run_fact_extraction` function is a method within a class that performs fact extraction on a set of markdown sections stored in `self.sections`. The function proceeds as follows:

1. **Helper function (process_section)**: 
   The function contains a nested helper function `process_section`, which handles the fact extraction for each individual section of markdown text. This function attempts to extract facts by calling the `fact_extraction` method 10 times, using the `retry` decorator to handle temporary failures. If the attempt fails after 10 retries, a warning is printed, and the section is skipped.

2. **Fact Extraction Process**:
   - The `process_section` function attempts to load a template called `"fact_extraction.txt"`, which is used to generate a prompt for the fact extraction agent.
   - It then prepares the data with the section text (`section_text`) and a user query (`self.user_query`), rendering the prompt with this data.
   - A call is made to the agent's `common_chat` method with the generated prompt. The response from this call is expected to be in JSON format, and if successful, it is parsed into a list of facts.
   - If the response is invalid (either empty or not in the expected format), an exception is raised to trigger the retry mechanism.

3. **Parallel Execution**:
   The `ThreadPoolExecutor` is used to parallelize the execution of the `process_section` function for each section in `self.sections`. This helps improve efficiency, especially when dealing with large numbers of sections.

4. **Result Filtering**:
   After attempting to process all sections, the results are filtered to exclude any sections that failed after the maximum number of retries (10 attempts). The function then returns a list of valid fact extraction results.

The function is called within `generate_benchmark_item`, where it processes sections of text and extracts facts in preparation for further analysis and benchmarking. The results of `run_fact_extraction` are parsed and used to generate a benchmark evaluation.

**Note**: 
- The retry mechanism is crucial for handling transient issues when interacting with the fact extraction agent.
- The function assumes that the agent's responses are in a specific format, and any deviation will result in an exception.
- If a section fails after the maximum retry attempts, it will be skipped, and no facts will be extracted for that section.

**Output Example**: 
Given a list of sections, the returned value could look like the following:

```
[
  ["Fact 1 from section 1", "Fact 2 from section 1"],
  ["Fact 1 from section 2", "Fact 2 from section 2", "Fact 3 from section 2"],
  ["Fact 1 from section 3"]
]
```

In this case, each element in the outer list corresponds to the extracted facts from each section, with each inner list containing the facts for a particular section. Sections that failed extraction after 10 attempts will not be present in the output.
#### FunctionDef process_section(section_text)
**process_section**: The function of process_section is to process a given section of text by extracting relevant facts using a predefined template and handling potential errors through retries.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· section_text: A string containing the text of the section to be processed.

**Code Description**: The process_section function is designed to handle the extraction of facts from a specified section of text. It utilizes a retry mechanism to attempt the extraction process multiple times in case of failure. The function begins by defining an inner function, attempt, which is decorated with a retry strategy that allows it to retry up to 10 times with a fixed wait time of 1 second between attempts.

Within the attempt function, the following steps are executed:
1. A template string is loaded from a file named "fact_extraction.txt" using the agent's load_template method.
2. A data dictionary is created, containing the section text and a user query.
3. The template is rendered with the data to create a prompt for the agent.
4. The agent's common_chat method is called with the generated prompt to obtain a response.

The response is then validated:
- If the response is not a list, it checks if the response is empty, raising an exception if so.
- It attempts to parse the response as JSON. If parsing fails, an exception is raised indicating that the conversion failed.
- If the parsed response is not a list, another exception is raised.

If the attempt function is successful, it returns the candidate list. If all attempts fail, the outer try-except block catches the exception, logs a warning message, and returns None, indicating that the section could not be processed.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the template file "fact_extraction.txt" is accessible and correctly formatted. Additionally, the user_query should be defined in the context where this function is called to ensure accurate processing.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be a list of extracted facts, such as:
[
    {"fact": "Fact 1", "source": "Source A"},
    {"fact": "Fact 2", "source": "Source B"}
]
##### FunctionDef attempt
**attempt**: The function of attempt is to execute a series of operations to extract facts based on a user query and a specific section of text.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· section_text: The text from which facts are to be extracted, provided as input to the function.
· self: Refers to the instance of the class in which the attempt function is defined, allowing access to its attributes and methods.

**Code Description**: The attempt function is designed to facilitate the extraction of factual information by performing several key operations. Initially, it loads a template for fact extraction using the `load_template` method from the `BaseAgent` class, which retrieves the content of a file named "fact_extraction.txt". This template serves as a structured format for the subsequent query.

Next, the function constructs a data dictionary containing two key pieces of information: `wiki_text`, which holds the content of the section being analyzed, and `UserQuery`, which contains the user's query. This data is then passed to the `render_template` method, which processes the template string with the provided data, effectively creating a prompt that is tailored to the user's request.

The generated prompt is then sent to the `common_chat` method, which interacts with the conversational model to obtain a response. This method is crucial as it manages the communication with the model, sending the prompt and receiving the output.

Upon receiving the response, the function checks if the response is a list. If the response is not a list or is empty, appropriate exceptions are raised to handle these scenarios. If the response is valid and in the expected format, it is returned as the output of the attempt function.

The attempt function is integral to the overall functionality of the application, as it combines template loading, data rendering, and model interaction to achieve its goal of fact extraction. It relies on the methods of the `BaseAgent` class, specifically `load_template`, `render_template`, and `common_chat`, to perform its operations effectively.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the `section_text` and `self.user_query` are properly defined and contain relevant information before invoking the attempt function. Additionally, error handling is implemented to manage cases where the response from the model does not meet the expected criteria.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the attempt function could be a list of extracted facts, such as:
[
    {"fact": "The capital of France is Paris."},
    {"fact": "The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter."}
]

### FunctionDef run_factualqa(self)
**run_factualqa**: The function of run_factualqa is to load a template for FactualQA evaluation, populate it with user query and ground truth data, and obtain a response from a conversational model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: The instance of the class that contains the run_factualqa method, which holds the necessary attributes for execution.

**Code Description**: The run_factualqa function is designed to facilitate the evaluation of factual questions by leveraging a template-based approach. It begins by loading a specific template file named "factual_qa.txt" using the load_template method from the BaseAgent class. This method retrieves the content of the template, which serves as a structured format for the subsequent evaluation process.

Next, the function prepares a data dictionary that includes:
- "Query": This is populated with the user's query, specifically accessed through the self.user_query attribute. This represents the updated user input that the function will evaluate.
- "BreadthGT": This is a JSON string representation of the ground truth data for breadth, obtained from self.breadth_gt. This data is crucial for assessing the breadth of knowledge related to the user's query.
- "DepthGT": This is directly taken from self.depth_gt, representing the ground truth data for depth.

The function then calls the render_template method, passing the loaded template string and the data dictionary. This method processes the template and replaces placeholders with the corresponding values from the data dictionary, resulting in a fully rendered prompt.

Following the rendering process, the function invokes the common_chat method, providing the rendered prompt as the usr_prompt parameter. This method is responsible for sending the prompt to a conversational model and receiving a response. The common_chat function manages the interaction with the model, ensuring that the prompt is processed correctly and that the response is relevant to the user's query.

Finally, the run_factualqa function returns the response obtained from the common_chat method, which encapsulates the model's answer to the user's query based on the provided ground truth data.

This function is integral to the overall evaluation process in the application, as it combines template loading, data preparation, and model interaction to deliver accurate responses to factual questions.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the attributes self.user_query, self.breadth_gt, and self.depth_gt are properly initialized and contain valid data before invoking this function. Any issues with these attributes may lead to errors during template rendering or model interaction.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the run_factualqa function could be a structured response such as: 
{
  "answer": "The capital of France is Paris.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "source": "Wikipedia"
} 
This output indicates the model's answer to the user's query, along with a confidence score and the source of the information.

### FunctionDef generate_benchmark_item(self, visualization)
**generate_benchmark_item**: The function of generate_benchmark_item is to perform benchmark evaluations by running fact extraction, parsing the results into structured tables, and optionally visualizing the data in a CSV format.

### Function Overview
The `generate_benchmark_item` method is responsible for orchestrating the benchmark process within the ReportBenchmark class. It performs several key tasks, including running a fact extraction process, parsing the extracted data into structured tables, and optionally exporting the results into a CSV file for visualization. The method returns a dictionary that includes the title of the benchmark, the breadth ground truth (GT), and the parsed fact extraction results.

### Parameters
- **visualization** (optional, default: `False`): A boolean flag that determines whether to visualize the parsed data in the form of a CSV file. If set to `True`, the method will merge the parsed data, create a Pandas DataFrame, and export it to a CSV file named `visualization.csv`.

### Workflow and Logic
1. **Fact Extraction**: 
   The method begins by invoking the `run_fact_extraction()` function, which performs parallelized fact extraction on a set of markdown sections. This function returns a list of fact extraction results for each section of text.

2. **Parsing Data**: 
   Once the fact extraction results are obtained, the method proceeds to parse the extracted facts. For each section of the fact extraction result, the method calls the `parse_tagged_data_to_table()` function. This function transforms the tagged data into structured table formats, and the results are collected into a list.

3. **Visualization (Optional)**: 
   If the `visualization` parameter is set to `True`, the method combines the parsed data from all sections into a single list. It then creates a Pandas DataFrame using this merged data and exports it to a CSV file called `visualization.csv`. Additionally, the DataFrame is printed for visualization purposes.

4. **Return Value**: 
   The method returns a dictionary containing the following keys:
   - **title**: The title of the breadth ground truth (GT).
   - **breadth_gt**: The breadth ground truth object itself.
   - **fact_extraction**: The parsed fact extraction results for all sections.

### Example Output
The returned dictionary would typically look as follows:

```python
{
    "title": "Benchmark Title",
    "breadth_gt": { ... },  # Breadth ground truth object
    "fact_extraction": [
        [{"Question": "What is the capital of France?", "Format": "text", "Answer": "Paris"}],
        [{"Question": "What is 2 + 2?", "Format": "number", "Answer": "4"}]
    ]
}
```

### Notes:
- The `run_fact_extraction()` method is crucial in this workflow as it retrieves the factual data from the markdown sections, while `parse_tagged_data_to_table()` organizes this data into a usable format.
- If the `visualization` flag is set to `True`, the resulting CSV file will contain a tabular representation of the extracted and parsed facts, which can be used for further analysis or visualization.
***
### FunctionDef parse_tagged_data_to_table(self, entries, csv_path)
**parse_tagged_data_to_table**: The function of parse_tagged_data_to_table is to parse a list of strings containing tagged data and convert them into a structured table format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· entries: List of strings with tagged content, where each string contains a question, a format description, and an answer, each enclosed in specific tags.
· csv_path: Optional string that specifies the file path to save the parsed data as a CSV file.

**Code Description**: The parse_tagged_data_to_table function processes a list of strings, each representing an entry with tagged data. The function uses regular expressions to extract the question, format description, and answer from each entry. The extracted data is then organized into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary corresponds to an entry and contains keys for "Question", "Format", and "Answer".

If a valid csv_path is provided (i.e., it ends with '.csv'), the function will create a Pandas DataFrame from the parsed data and save it to the specified CSV file. This feature allows for easy export and further analysis of the data in a tabular format. If no csv_path is provided, the function simply returns the list of dictionaries containing the parsed data.

This function is called by the generate_benchmark_item method within the ReportBenchmark class. In this context, it is used to process the results of a fact extraction operation. The generate_benchmark_item method collects the fact extraction results, iterates through each section, and calls parse_tagged_data_to_table to convert the tagged data into a structured format. The results from each call are aggregated into a final list, which can be further processed or visualized as needed.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the entries provided are correctly formatted with the required tags. Additionally, if saving to a CSV file, verify that the provided path is valid and ends with '.csv' to avoid errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could look like this:
[
    {"Question": "What is the capital of France?", "Format": "text", "Answer": "Paris"},
    {"Question": "What is 2 + 2?", "Format": "number", "Answer": "4"}
]
***
### FunctionDef verify_extraction_meaningful(self)
**verify_extraction_meaningful**: The function of verify_extraction_meaningful is to check if the fact extraction result is meaningful enough and correct.

**parameters**: This function does not accept any parameters.

**Code Description**:  
The function `verify_extraction_meaningful` is defined within a class, but the exact functionality is not implemented in the provided code. The comment above the function suggests its intended purpose: to validate whether the result of a fact extraction process is both meaningful and correct. However, the function body is empty (`pass`), indicating that the actual logic for verifying the extraction has yet to be defined. The comment implies that this function is designed to evaluate the quality and accuracy of extracted facts, possibly comparing them to predefined criteria or assessing their relevance to the context of the application.

**Note**:  
Since the function body has not been implemented, it does not currently perform any actions. Developers will need to implement the specific logic to evaluate the meaningfulness and correctness of the extracted facts when integrating this function into the application.
