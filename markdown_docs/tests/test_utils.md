## FunctionDef test_single_citation
**test_single_citation**: The function of test_single_citation is to validate the functionality of the extract_citations function by testing its ability to correctly extract a URL from a formatted citation in a given text.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function are as follows:
· None

**Code Description**: The test_single_citation function is a unit test designed to ensure that the extract_citations function operates correctly when provided with a specific input string containing a citation. In this test, a string variable named `text` is defined, which includes a citation formatted as `<citation>http://example.com</citation>`. The function then asserts that the output of the extract_citations function, when called with this text, matches the expected result, which is a list containing the single URL `["http://example.com"]`.

This test serves as a basic validation of the extract_citations function's ability to identify and extract URLs enclosed within <citation> tags. It checks that the function can handle a straightforward case where only one citation is present in the input text. The assertion ensures that if the extract_citations function does not return the expected output, the test will fail, indicating a potential issue with the citation extraction logic.

The test_single_citation function is part of a broader suite of tests that may be implemented to cover various scenarios for the extract_citations function, including cases with multiple citations, malformed citations, and edge cases where no citations are present. By validating the functionality of extract_citations through unit tests like test_single_citation, developers can maintain confidence in the reliability and correctness of the citation extraction process within the application.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the extract_citations function is properly implemented and that the input text is formatted correctly with <citation> tags for the test to pass successfully. If the extract_citations function fails to extract the citation as expected, it may indicate a bug or an issue with the regular expression used for matching.
## FunctionDef test_multiple_citations_and_whitespace
**test_multiple_citations_and_whitespace**: The function of test_multiple_citations_and_whitespace is to test the extraction of URLs from text that contains multiple citation tags, accounting for possible variations in whitespace and formatting.

**parameters**: The function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:  
The function `test_multiple_citations_and_whitespace` is designed to validate the behavior of the `extract_citations` function when dealing with multiple citation tags, ensuring that URLs are correctly extracted from text that may contain varied whitespace and formatting.

- The test function defines a multiline string `text`, which contains two citation tags with URLs inside. The URLs in the citation tags are formatted with different whitespace patterns. One citation has extra spaces before and after the URL, while the other citation spans multiple lines. This tests the robustness of the `extract_citations` function against such irregular formatting.
  
- The `assert` statement checks that the result of calling `extract_citations(text)` matches the expected output, which is a list of two URLs: `["https://foo.com/path", "https://bar.com"]`. The expected result strips any leading or trailing spaces around the URLs and ensures that URLs are correctly identified despite the variations in formatting and whitespace.

The `extract_citations` function, called within this test, is responsible for parsing the text and extracting all URLs enclosed within `<citation>...</citation>` tags. It handles different variations of the citation content, such as URLs with extra whitespace or those that span multiple lines. 

By performing this test, the function ensures that the `extract_citations` function can handle citations in diverse formats, returning a clean and consistent list of URLs.

**Note**: This test assumes that the `extract_citations` function has been correctly implemented and is able to handle variations in whitespace and formatting around citation tags. The function will return a list of URLs in the order they appear within the citation tags, after stripping any excess whitespace.
## FunctionDef test_duplicate_citations_are_preserved
**test_duplicate_citations_are_preserved**: The function of test_duplicate_citations_are_preserved is to verify that duplicate citations within a given text are preserved in the order they appear when extracted.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function are as follows:
· None

**Code Description**: The test_duplicate_citations_are_preserved function is a unit test designed to validate the behavior of the extract_citations function from the utils module. It provides a specific input string containing duplicate citation tags and checks that the output of extract_citations correctly reflects the presence of these duplicates.

The input text for this test is defined as "<citation>dup</citation> first, then again <citation>dup</citation>". This string includes two identical citation tags with the content "dup". The purpose of this test is to ensure that the extract_citations function does not remove duplicates but instead retains them in the order they appear in the input text.

The assertion statement within the function checks that the output of extract_citations when applied to the input text is equal to the list ["dup", "dup"]. This confirms that the function behaves as expected by preserving duplicate citations rather than filtering them out.

This test is crucial for maintaining the integrity of citation extraction within the project, as it ensures that all citations, regardless of duplication, are accurately captured. The extract_citations function is utilized in various parts of the project, such as process_section and parse_markdown_to_structure, where accurate citation extraction is essential for proper document processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input text is formatted correctly with <citation> tags for the extract_citations function to operate effectively. The test specifically demonstrates that the function's current implementation does not deduplicate citations, which is a key aspect of its intended functionality.
## FunctionDef test_no_citations_returns_empty_list
**test_no_citations_returns_empty_list**: The function of test_no_citations_returns_empty_list is to verify that the extract_citations function returns an empty list when no <citation> tags are present in the input text.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function are as follows:
· None

**Code Description**: The function test_no_citations_returns_empty_list is a unit test designed to validate the behavior of the extract_citations function when the input text does not contain any <citation> tags. It calls the extract_citations function with a string "no tags here" as the argument, which does not include any <citation> tags. The test asserts that the return value of the extract_citations function is an empty list. This ensures that when no citations are present in the input text, the function correctly returns an empty list.

The test serves as a check to ensure that the extract_citations function behaves as expected in the case of an input that does not include any citations. If the extract_citations function fails to return an empty list in this scenario, the test would fail, signaling that the function's handling of such cases is not working correctly.

**Note**: This test case does not require any parameters to be passed directly to it, as the input text is hardcoded within the test function. It only verifies the scenario where no citation tags are found in the input.

**Output Example**: The expected return value from the extract_citations function when the input text is "no tags here" would be:
```python
[]
```
