## FunctionDef test_extract_citations(input_text, expected)
**test_extract_citations**: The function of test_extract_citations is to validate the functionality of the extract_citations function by comparing its output against expected results.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function are as follows:
· input_text: A string representing the text input that contains `<citation>` tags from which URLs will be extracted.
· expected: A list representing the expected output of unique URLs extracted from the input_text.

**Code Description**: The test_extract_citations function is a unit test designed to ensure the correct operation of the extract_citations function. It takes two parameters: input_text, which is the text containing potential `<citation>` tags, and expected, which is the anticipated list of URLs that should be extracted from the input_text.

Within the function, an assertion is made that the output of the extract_citations function, when called with input_text, matches the expected value. This assertion serves as a verification step, confirming that the extract_citations function behaves as intended by returning the correct list of unique URLs.

The extract_citations function, which is being tested, is responsible for parsing the input text to identify and extract URLs enclosed within `<citation>` tags. It utilizes regular expressions to locate these tags and processes the matches to ensure that the returned list is unique and in the original order. The test_extract_citations function thus plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the extract_citations function, ensuring that any changes or updates to the code do not inadvertently break its expected behavior.

This unit test is essential for developers working on the project, as it provides a safety net that helps catch errors early in the development process. By running this test, developers can confirm that the extract_citations function continues to perform correctly as the codebase evolves.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input_text provided in the test cases is formatted correctly and contains the expected `<citation>` tags. If the input does not conform to the expected format, the test may yield unexpected results.
