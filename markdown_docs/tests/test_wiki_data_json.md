## FunctionDef test_all_wiki_json_valid
**test_all_wiki_json_valid**: The function of test_all_wiki_json_valid is to validate the JSON files located in the specified directory by attempting to parse them and reporting any failures.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
Â· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The function begins by initializing an empty list called `failures` to keep track of any JSON files that fail to parse correctly. It then iterates over all JSON files in the `DATA_DIR` directory, which is expected to contain files with a `.json` extension. Each file is read as text using UTF-8 encoding. 

Before attempting to parse the JSON, there is a commented-out section of code that, if uncommented, would remove any lines that start with `//`, which are typically used for comments in JSON files. This indicates that the function may be designed to handle JSON files that could potentially contain such comment lines.

The function then attempts to load the text as JSON using `json.loads()`. If a `JSONDecodeError` is raised during this process, it means that the file is not valid JSON, and the error message, along with the file name, is appended to the `failures` list.

After all files have been processed, the function checks if there are any entries in the `failures` list. If there are, it calls `pytest.fail()` to report the failures, providing a message that lists all the JSON files that could not be parsed along with their respective error messages.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `DATA_DIR` variable is correctly defined and points to the directory containing the JSON files. Additionally, if the JSON files may contain comment lines, consider uncommenting the cleaning code to avoid parsing errors. This function is intended to be used in a testing context, specifically with the pytest framework, to ensure that all JSON files are valid before further processing.
