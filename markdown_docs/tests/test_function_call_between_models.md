## FunctionDef test_function_call(model)
**test_function_call**: The function of `test_function_call` is to test the behavior of the `call_llm` function when called with different models, ensuring the correct handling of tool calls and function arguments based on model type.

**parameters**: The parameters of this function are as follows:
- model: A string representing the model name to be tested.

**Code Description**: 
The `test_function_call` function is designed to verify the behavior of the `call_llm` function when different models are used. It takes a single parameter, `model`, which represents the name of the model to be tested. 

The function performs the following steps:
1. It first calls the `call_llm` function with the `model`, `usr_prompt`, `config`, and `tools` parameters, where `usr_prompt` is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code (likely as a list or string) and contains the input message for the model, `config` is a settings dictionary for the model, and `tools` is an optional list of tools available for the model's interaction.

2. The function then proceeds to check the behavior based on the model name. If the model belongs to the "deepseek_family" (i.e., "r1" or "reasoner"), it asserts that no tool calls are returned by the `call_llm` function, raising an `AssertionError` if tool calls are present. This is done using the `pytest.raises(AssertionError)` construct, which ensures that the model should not generate any tool calls.

3. For models other than those in the "deepseek_family", such as GPT-4o-mini or similar, the function checks that valid tool calls are returned. If no tool calls are returned, the function will raise an assertion failure with a specific message. Additionally, for each tool call returned, the function verifies that the tool call's function name is `"get_weather"` and that the function arguments contain `"location"`. These checks ensure that the correct function and arguments are used, validating the model's response and interaction with tools.

The test ensures the correctness of the `call_llm` functionâ€™s integration with various models, verifying both the presence of tool calls and the correctness of the function name and arguments.

**Note**: 
- The test assumes that `messages`, `settings`, and `tools` are predefined elsewhere in the code.
- The behavior of the test is dependent on the `model` parameter passed to the function, and it distinguishes between models that should not return tool calls (e.g., "r1", "reasoner") and models that should return valid tool calls.
- The specific function name checked is `"get_weather"`, and it is assumed that all models generating tool calls should utilize this function for weather-related queries.
- The use of `pytest` for exception handling ensures that expected errors are correctly raised in the event of invalid tool calls.

**Output Example**:
For a model such as "r1" that belongs to the deepseek family, the expected result would be an AssertionError if any tool calls are present:

```
AssertionError: Model r1 should not return tool_calls.
```

For a model like "GPT-4o-mini" that is expected to return tool calls, a correct output would look like:

```
Model GPT-4o-mini returned empty tool_calls.
Model GPT-4o-mini returned incorrect function name.
Model GPT-4o-mini returned incorrect function arguments.
```

In these cases, the test would fail, highlighting the specific mismatch in the tool calls, function name, or function arguments.
