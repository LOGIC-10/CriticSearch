## ClassDef GlobalContextNotebook
**GlobalContextNotebook**: The function of GlobalContextNotebook is to manage and optimize the storage and retrieval of text embeddings and knowledge graphs for enhanced contextual understanding.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· text_embeddings: A dictionary that stores text embeddings, which are numerical representations of text data used for various natural language processing tasks.
· knowledge_graph: A dictionary that maintains a knowledge graph, representing relationships between different entities or concepts.
· optimized_subgraphs: A dictionary that contains optimized subgraphs, which are refined portions of the knowledge graph aimed at improving efficiency in data retrieval and processing.

**Code Description**: The GlobalContextNotebook class is designed to facilitate the management of contextual information through the use of embeddings and knowledge graphs. Upon initialization, it creates three empty dictionaries: text_embeddings, knowledge_graph, and optimized_subgraphs. 

The class includes three methods:

1. **update(state, node)**: This method is intended to update the text embeddings and the knowledge graph based on the current state and a specific node. Although the implementation is not provided (indicated by the 'pass' statement), it is expected to modify the internal dictionaries to reflect new information or changes in the context.

2. **find_related_paths(state)**: This method aims to identify and return optimized subgraphs that are related to the given state. The specifics of how the related paths are determined are not detailed in the code, but the method is crucial for efficiently navigating the knowledge graph.

3. **prune()**: This method is responsible for removing ineffective workflows from the knowledge graph or the optimized subgraphs. The exact criteria for what constitutes an "ineffective" workflow are not specified, but this function is essential for maintaining the relevance and efficiency of the stored data.

**Note**: Users of the GlobalContextNotebook class should be aware that the methods provided do not contain complete implementations. The update, find_related_paths, and prune methods require further development to fulfill their intended purposes effectively. Additionally, the management of the dictionaries should be handled carefully to ensure data integrity and relevance.

**Output Example**: An example of the potential output from the find_related_paths method could be a list of optimized subgraphs represented as dictionaries, such as:
{
    "subgraph_1": {"node_a": "related_info_1", "node_b": "related_info_2"},
    "subgraph_2": {"node_c": "related_info_3", "node_d": "related_info_4"}
}
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the GlobalContextNotebook object by setting up its internal data structures.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the GlobalContextNotebook class. When an instance of this class is created, this function is automatically called to initialize the object. It sets up three internal attributes: 
- `self.text_embeddings`: This is initialized as an empty dictionary, which is intended to store text embeddings. Text embeddings are numerical representations of text that can be used in various machine learning and natural language processing tasks.
- `self.knowledge_graph`: This is also initialized as an empty dictionary. It is likely intended to hold a knowledge graph, which is a structured representation of knowledge that can include entities and their relationships.
- `self.optimized_subgraphs`: This is initialized as an empty dictionary as well. This attribute may be used to store optimized versions of subgraphs derived from the knowledge graph, potentially for improved performance in querying or analysis.

Overall, the __init__ function establishes the foundational data structures necessary for the GlobalContextNotebook to function effectively in managing text embeddings, knowledge graphs, and their optimized representations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the attributes initialized in this function are properly populated and managed throughout the lifecycle of the GlobalContextNotebook object to maintain the integrity and functionality of the class.

### FunctionDef update(self, state, node)
**update**: The function of update is to update embeddings and the knowledge graph based on the provided state and node.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· state: Represents the current state of the system or model that is being updated. It contains the necessary information required for the update process.
· node: Refers to a specific node in the knowledge graph that is targeted for the update. This could represent an entity or a relationship that needs to be modified or enhanced.

**Code Description**: The update function is designed to facilitate the process of updating embeddings and the knowledge graph. Although the function body currently contains a placeholder (pass), it is intended to implement the logic necessary to modify the embeddings and the knowledge graph based on the input parameters. The state parameter is crucial as it provides the context or conditions under which the update should occur. The node parameter specifies which part of the knowledge graph is to be updated, allowing for targeted modifications. This function is likely part of a larger system that manages embeddings and knowledge graphs, and its implementation will be essential for maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the data represented in these structures.

**Note**: It is important to implement the logic within this function to ensure that the embeddings and knowledge graph are updated correctly. Proper handling of the state and node parameters is critical for the function to perform its intended purpose effectively.
***
### FunctionDef find_related_paths(self, state)
**find_related_paths**: The function of find_related_paths is to find and return related optimized subgraphs.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· state: This parameter represents the current state of the context in which the function is operating. It is expected to contain information necessary for identifying related paths.

**Code Description**: The find_related_paths function is designed to identify and return subgraphs that are optimized and related to the current state provided as an argument. The function currently contains a placeholder implementation (indicated by the 'pass' statement), which means that the actual logic for finding these related paths has not yet been implemented. The intended functionality suggests that the function will analyze the provided state to determine which subgraphs are relevant and optimized for the given context. This could involve traversing a graph structure, applying optimization criteria, and collecting the relevant subgraphs for output.

**Note**: It is important to implement the logic within this function to ensure it performs the intended operations. Additionally, the function should handle various states appropriately to avoid errors or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a list of optimized subgraphs represented in a specific format, such as:
[
    {'subgraph_id': 1, 'nodes': [1, 2, 3], 'edges': [(1, 2), (2, 3)]},
    {'subgraph_id': 2, 'nodes': [4, 5], 'edges': [(4, 5)]}
] 
This example illustrates a scenario where two optimized subgraphs are returned, each with its own unique identifier, nodes, and edges.
***
### FunctionDef prune(self)
**prune**: The function of prune is to remove ineffective workflows.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The prune function is designed to eliminate workflows that are deemed ineffective within the context of the application. Currently, the function body contains a placeholder comment indicating its intended purpose, but it does not implement any logic or functionality at this time. The use of the `pass` statement signifies that the function is incomplete and serves as a stub for future development. When fully implemented, this function will likely include logic to assess the effectiveness of various workflows and subsequently remove those that do not meet certain criteria or performance metrics.

**Note**: It is important to recognize that as it stands, the prune function does not perform any operations. Developers intending to utilize this function should ensure that it is properly implemented before calling it in their workflows. Additionally, any criteria for determining the effectiveness of workflows should be clearly defined and integrated into the function's logic to achieve the desired outcome.
