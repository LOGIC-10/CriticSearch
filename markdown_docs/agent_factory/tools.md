## ClassDef ParameterProperty
**ParameterProperty**: The function of ParameterProperty is to define the properties of a parameter, including its type and an optional description.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· type: str - This attribute specifies the data type of the parameter (e.g., 'string'). It is a required field.
· description: Optional[str] - This attribute provides a description of the parameter. It is an optional field that can be set to None.

**Code Description**: The ParameterProperty class is a model that encapsulates the characteristics of a parameter used within a broader context, such as in API specifications or configuration settings. It inherits from BaseModel, which likely provides foundational functionality for data validation and serialization. The 'type' attribute is mandatory and must be provided when an instance of ParameterProperty is created, ensuring that every parameter has a defined data type. The 'description' attribute is optional, allowing for additional context to be provided about the parameter, which can be useful for documentation or user guidance.

This class is utilized within the Parameters class, which represents a collection of parameters. The Parameters class contains a dictionary where the keys are parameter names and the values are instances of ParameterProperty. This relationship indicates that each parameter defined in the Parameters class can have its own specific properties, as defined by the ParameterProperty class. The integration of ParameterProperty within Parameters allows for a structured and detailed representation of parameters, facilitating better management and understanding of the parameters in use.

**Note**: When using the ParameterProperty class, ensure that the 'type' attribute is always provided, as it is essential for the correct functioning of the model. The 'description' attribute can be utilized to enhance clarity and understanding of the parameter's purpose.
## ClassDef Parameters
**Parameters**: The function of Parameters is to represent a collection of parameter definitions for functions, including their types, properties, and requirements.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· type: str - This attribute specifies the type of the parameter object, defaulting to "object". It is a required field.
· properties: Dict[str, ParameterProperty] - This attribute is a dictionary where the keys are parameter names and the values are instances of ParameterProperty, defining the properties of each parameter. It is a required field.
· required: List[str] - This attribute is a list of parameter names that are required for the function. It is a required field.
· additionalProperties: bool - This attribute indicates whether additional properties beyond those defined in the properties dictionary are allowed. It defaults to False.

**Code Description**: The Parameters class is designed to encapsulate the schema for parameters used in function definitions. It inherits from BaseModel, which provides essential functionality for data validation and serialization. The class includes several attributes that define the structure and requirements of the parameters.

The 'type' attribute indicates the nature of the parameter object, which is set to "object" by default. The 'properties' attribute is crucial as it holds a dictionary of parameter names mapped to their respective ParameterProperty instances. Each ParameterProperty defines the characteristics of a parameter, such as its type and an optional description, thereby allowing for a detailed representation of each parameter's requirements.

The 'required' attribute lists the names of parameters that must be provided when a function is called, ensuring that essential parameters are not omitted. The 'additionalProperties' attribute controls whether parameters not explicitly defined in the properties dictionary can be included, with a default value of False to enforce strict adherence to the defined schema.

The Parameters class is utilized within the Function class, which represents a function's metadata, including its name, description, and parameters schema. This relationship indicates that the Parameters class is integral to defining how functions are structured and what parameters they accept.

Additionally, the Parameters class is referenced in the create_schema_from_function method, which dynamically generates a schema for a function based on its signature and documentation. This method extracts parameter information and constructs a Parameters instance, ensuring that the generated schema adheres to the defined structure and requirements.

**Note**: When using the Parameters class, ensure that all required attributes are provided, particularly the 'properties' and 'required' attributes, to maintain the integrity of the parameter schema. The 'additionalProperties' attribute can be adjusted based on the desired flexibility of the parameter definitions.

**Code Description**: The Tool class is designed to encapsulate the concept of a tool that can execute a specific function within the system. It inherits from BaseModel, which provides essential capabilities for data validation and serialization. The class contains two primary attributes: type and function.

The 'type' attribute is a string that specifies the nature of the tool, with a default value of 'function'. This indicates that the Tool is specifically designed to work with functions, providing clarity on its intended use.

The 'function' attribute is an instance of the Function class, which represents the metadata of the function that the tool is associated with. This includes the function's name, description, and a schema for its parameters. The integration of the Function class within the Tool class highlights the importance of having a structured representation of the function's metadata, which is crucial for understanding how the tool operates.

A key method within the Tool class is `create_schema_from_function`, which is a class method that dynamically generates a Tool schema based on a target function. This method performs several tasks:

1. It extracts the function's name and documentation string using the `inspect` module.
2. It parses the documentation string to generate sections that provide a description and parameter details.
3. It retrieves the function's signature to gather information about its parameters, including their types and default values.
4. It constructs a dynamic model for the parameters using the `create_model` function, allowing for flexible definition of parameter fields.
5. Finally, it builds a complete Function instance that encapsulates the function's metadata and returns a serialized representation of the Tool instance.

This method exemplifies how the Tool class serves as a bridge between the raw function and its structured representation, facilitating the creation of tools that can execute functions with well-defined parameters and metadata.

**Note**: When utilizing the Tool class, it is essential to ensure that the function provided to `create_schema_from_function` is well-defined, with clear documentation and parameter annotations. This will ensure that the generated Tool schema accurately reflects the function's capabilities and requirements.

**Output Example**: An example of the output returned by the `create_schema_from_function` method might look like this:
```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "example_function",
    "description": "This function serves as an example.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "param1": {
          "type": "int",
          "description": "An integer parameter."
        },
        "param2": {
          "type": "str",
          "description": "A string parameter."
        }
      },
      "required": ["param1"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```
### FunctionDef create_schema_from_function(cls, target_function)
**create_schema_from_function**: The function of create_schema_from_function is to create a Tool schema from a target function.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· cls: This parameter represents the class that is calling the method, typically used for class methods to access class-level attributes and methods.
· target_function: This parameter is the function from which the schema will be generated. It is expected to contain the function's signature and documentation.

**Code Description**: The create_schema_from_function method is a class method designed to generate a schema representation of a function, encapsulating its metadata, including its name, description, and parameters. The method begins by extracting the name and documentation string of the provided target function using the `__name__` attribute and the `inspect.getdoc()` function. If no documentation is found, it defaults to "No description provided."

The method then parses the documentation string using a `Docstring` class, which currently supports Google-style docstrings. It identifies sections within the docstring, specifically focusing on the textual description and the parameters section. The parameters section is further processed to extract individual parameter details.

Next, the method retrieves the function's signature using `inspect.signature()`, which provides information about the function's parameters, including their names, types, and default values. For each parameter, the method checks if a description is available from the parsed docstring and constructs a dictionary of fields that define the parameter's type and properties.

A dynamic model called `DynamicParameters` is created using the `create_model` function, which utilizes the collected fields. This model encapsulates the parameters' schema, allowing for structured representation.

The method then constructs a properties dictionary that maps each parameter name to its corresponding type and description. Finally, it builds a `Function` instance, which includes the function's name, description, and parameters schema. This `Function` instance is then wrapped in a `Tool` schema, which is returned as a serialized output using the `model_dump()` method.

The create_schema_from_function method is integral to the Tool class, as it allows for the dynamic generation of function schemas based on existing functions, facilitating the creation of tools that can execute these functions with well-defined parameters.

**Note**: When using the create_schema_from_function method, ensure that the target_function provided has a well-defined signature and documentation string to generate an accurate schema. The method relies on the presence of parameter descriptions in the docstring to enhance the generated schema's clarity.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the create_schema_from_function method could look like this:
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "example_function",
        "description": "This function serves as an example.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "param1": {
                    "type": "int",
                    "description": "An integer parameter."
                },
                "param2": {
                    "type": "str",
                    "description": "A string parameter."
                }
            },
            "required": ["param1"],
            "additionalProperties": false
        }
    }
}
