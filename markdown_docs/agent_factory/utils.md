## FunctionDef read_prompt_template(file_path)
**read_prompt_template**: The function of read_prompt_template is to read the contents of a specified file and return it as a string.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· file_path: A string representing the path to the file that contains the prompt template to be read.

**Code Description**: The read_prompt_template function is designed to open a file located at the path specified by the file_path parameter. It uses a context manager (the 'with' statement) to ensure that the file is properly opened and closed after its contents are read. Inside the context manager, the file is opened in read mode ('r'), and the entire content of the file is read using the read() method. The contents are then stored in the variable prompt, which is subsequently returned as the output of the function. This function is useful for loading prompt templates or any text data stored in a file format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the file specified by file_path exists and is accessible; otherwise, a FileNotFoundError will be raised. Additionally, the function assumes that the file contains text data and is encoded in a format compatible with the default encoding used by Python (usually UTF-8).

**Output Example**: If the file located at the specified file_path contains the text "Hello, this is a prompt template.", the function will return the string "Hello, this is a prompt template."
## FunctionDef call_llm(model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, config)
**call_llm**: The function of call_llm is to interact with a language model API to generate a response based on provided system and user prompts.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: A string representing the name of the language model to be used for generating the response.
· sys_prompt: A string that serves as the system message, providing context or instructions to the model.
· usr_prompt: A string that represents the user's input or question directed to the model.
· config: A dictionary containing configuration settings, including API keys, base URLs, timeout settings, and other parameters necessary for the API call.

**Code Description**: The call_llm function initiates a connection to an OpenAI language model using the provided configuration settings. It retrieves the API key and base URL specific to the model from the config dictionary. The function sets up a client instance of the OpenAI API with specified timeout and retry settings.

Next, it constructs a list of messages, where the first message is the system prompt and the second is the user prompt. These messages are formatted as dictionaries containing the role (either "system" or "user") and the corresponding content.

The function then calls the chat completion endpoint of the OpenAI client, passing the model name and the constructed messages. It also includes a temperature setting from the config, which controls the randomness of the model's responses. The function is designed to handle a maximum token limit, although this is currently commented out in the code.

After receiving the response from the API, the function extracts the content of the first message in the response choices and returns it. This content represents the model's generated reply based on the inputs provided.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the config dictionary is properly populated with the necessary keys and values, including the model-specific API key and base URL. Additionally, be aware of the potential for rate limits or errors from the API, which may require handling in a production environment.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be a string such as "The weather today is sunny with a high of 75 degrees." This represents the model's generated response based on the provided prompts.
