## FunctionDef read_prompt_template(file_path)
**read_prompt_template**: The function of read_prompt_template is to read the contents of a specified file and return it as a string.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· file_path: A string representing the path to the file that contains the prompt template to be read.

**Code Description**: The read_prompt_template function is designed to open a file located at the path specified by the file_path parameter. It uses a context manager (the 'with' statement) to ensure that the file is properly opened and closed after its contents are read. Inside the context manager, the file is opened in read mode ('r'), and the entire content of the file is read using the read() method. The contents are then stored in the variable prompt, which is subsequently returned as the output of the function. This function is useful for loading prompt templates or any text data stored in a file format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the file specified by file_path exists and is accessible; otherwise, a FileNotFoundError will be raised. Additionally, the function assumes that the file contains text data and is encoded in a format compatible with the default encoding used by Python (usually UTF-8).

**Output Example**: If the file located at the specified file_path contains the text "Hello, this is a prompt template.", the function will return the string "Hello, this is a prompt template."
## FunctionDef call_llm(model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, config)
**call_llm**: The function of call_llm is to make an API request to a language model service, sending a system and user prompt, and returning the model's response.

**parameters**: The parameters of this function.
· model: The model name or identifier used for making the request to the language model service.
· sys_prompt: A string that serves as the system message for the model, providing instructions or context for the conversation.
· usr_prompt: A string that serves as the user's message or input for the model, to which the model should respond.
· config: A dictionary containing configuration settings required for the request, including API keys, timeouts, retry settings, temperature, and model-specific settings.

**Code Description**:  
The `call_llm` function is responsible for interfacing with a language model API (presumably OpenAI's API). It does so by creating a client instance for the OpenAI service using the configuration values passed in the `config` parameter. The function then constructs a list of messages that includes the system message (`sys_prompt`) and the user message (`usr_prompt`). This list is sent as part of the request to the `chat.completions.create` method of the API client.

The function retrieves the response from the API and extracts the model's reply from the `choices` list in the response. Specifically, it fetches the content of the message from the first choice in the list, which is assumed to be the relevant response from the model.

Key steps in the process:
1. An instance of the OpenAI client is created using the provided configuration values, including the API key, base URL, timeout, and retry settings.
2. A list of messages is constructed, where the system message provides context or instructions, and the user message contains the query or input.
3. The request is sent to the API, specifying the model, the messages, and other parameters like temperature.
4. The model's response is extracted from the API's response and returned as the result.

The `call_llm` function is called within the `chat` method of the `BaseAgent` class in the `agent_factory/agent.py` module. In this context, it is used to send a dynamically rendered prompt to the language model based on the input data. The system and user prompts are provided as part of this interaction, and the function returns the model's response to be processed further or sent back to the user.

**Note**:  
- The `config` parameter must include valid API keys and any necessary configuration settings like `timeout`, `max_retries`, and `temperature` for the API request to be successful.
- The function assumes the model will return a response in the form of a list of choices, with the actual message located in `response.choices[0].message`.
- While the `max_tokens` parameter is mentioned in the code as a potential setting, it is commented out, implying it is either optional or controlled elsewhere in the codebase.

**Output Example**:  
The return value of `call_llm` would typically be a string representing the content of the model's response. For example:

```
"Sure, here's the information you requested: ... "
```
