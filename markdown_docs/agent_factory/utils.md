## FunctionDef read_prompt_template(file_path)
**read_prompt_template**: The function of read_prompt_template is to read the contents of a specified file and return it as a string.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· file_path: A string representing the path to the file that contains the prompt template to be read.

**Code Description**: The read_prompt_template function is designed to open a file located at the path specified by the file_path parameter. It uses a context manager (the 'with' statement) to ensure that the file is properly opened and closed after its contents are read. Inside the context manager, the file is opened in read mode ('r'), and the entire content of the file is read using the read() method. The contents are then stored in the variable prompt, which is subsequently returned as the output of the function. This function is useful for loading prompt templates or any text data stored in a file format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the file specified by file_path exists and is accessible; otherwise, a FileNotFoundError will be raised. Additionally, the function assumes that the file contains text data and is encoded in a format compatible with the default encoding used by Python (usually UTF-8).

**Output Example**: If the file located at the specified file_path contains the text "Hello, this is a prompt template.", the function will return the string "Hello, this is a prompt template."
## FunctionDef call_llm(model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, config)
**call_llm**: The function of call_llm is to interact with a language model API by sending a system prompt and a user prompt, and returning the model's response.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: A string representing the identifier of the language model to be used for generating responses.
· sys_prompt: A string that serves as the system prompt, providing context or instructions to the language model.
· usr_prompt: A string that contains the user-specific prompt, which is dynamically generated based on user input.
· config: A dictionary containing configuration settings, including API key, base URL, timeout, maximum retries, and temperature for the model.

**Code Description**: The call_llm function is designed to facilitate communication with a language model by making an API request. It begins by initializing an OpenAI client using the provided configuration settings. The API key and base URL are extracted from the config dictionary based on the specified model, ensuring that the correct credentials and endpoint are used for the API call.

The function constructs a list of messages that includes both the system prompt and the user prompt. These messages are formatted as dictionaries, where each dictionary specifies the role (either "system" or "user") and the corresponding content. This structured format is essential for the language model to understand the context of the conversation.

Next, the function calls the chat completion method of the OpenAI client, passing in the model identifier, the constructed messages, and additional parameters such as temperature. The temperature setting influences the randomness of the model's responses, allowing for more creative or focused outputs depending on the desired outcome.

Upon receiving the response from the API, the function extracts the content of the first message choice returned by the model. This content represents the model's reply to the user prompt and is returned as the output of the call_llm function.

The call_llm function is invoked by the chat method of the BaseAgent class, which is responsible for generating user-specific prompts based on input data. The chat method renders a prompt template using the provided data and then calls call_llm with the necessary parameters. This relationship highlights the role of call_llm as a backend service that processes user interactions and generates responses from the language model.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the configuration settings provided to the call_llm function are complete and valid to avoid errors during the API interaction. Additionally, the model specified must be supported by the OpenAI client to ensure successful communication.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the call_llm function could be a string such as "Here is the information you requested based on your input: ..."
