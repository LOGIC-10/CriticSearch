## FunctionDef read_prompt_template(file_path)
**read_prompt_template**: The function of read_prompt_template is to read the contents of a specified file and return it as a string.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· file_path: A string representing the path to the file that contains the prompt template to be read.

**Code Description**: The read_prompt_template function is designed to open a file located at the path specified by the file_path parameter. It uses a context manager (the 'with' statement) to ensure that the file is properly opened and closed after its contents are read. Inside the context manager, the file is opened in read mode ('r'), and the entire content of the file is read using the read() method. The contents are then stored in the variable prompt, which is subsequently returned as the output of the function. This function is useful for loading prompt templates or any text data stored in a file format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the file specified by file_path exists and is accessible; otherwise, a FileNotFoundError will be raised. Additionally, the function assumes that the file contains text data and is encoded in a format compatible with the default encoding used by Python (usually UTF-8).

**Output Example**: If the file located at the specified file_path contains the text "Hello, this is a prompt template.", the function will return the string "Hello, this is a prompt template."
## FunctionDef call_llm(model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, config)
**call_llm**: The function of call_llm is to interact with a language model API to generate a response based on provided prompts.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: A string representing the name of the language model to be used for generating responses.
· sys_prompt: A string containing the system-level prompt that sets the context for the model.
· usr_prompt: A string that represents the user-level prompt, which is the specific query or input from the user.
· config: A dictionary containing configuration settings such as API key, base URL, timeout, maximum retries, temperature, and maximum tokens for the model.

**Code Description**: The call_llm function is designed to facilitate communication with a language model, specifically through the OpenAI API. It begins by initializing an OpenAI client using the provided model name and configuration settings. The configuration includes essential parameters such as the API key, base URL, timeout, and maximum retries, which are retrieved from the config dictionary.

Next, the function constructs a list of messages that includes both the system prompt and the user prompt. This structured format is necessary for the chat completion request to the API. The function then calls the chat completion method of the OpenAI client, passing in the model name, the constructed messages, and additional parameters like temperature and maximum tokens.

Upon receiving the response from the API, the function extracts the content of the first message choice from the response object and returns it. This content represents the model's generated reply based on the provided prompts.

The call_llm function is invoked within the breakdown_task method of the Manager class in the agent_factory/manager.py file. In this context, it is used to break down a larger task into smaller sub-tasks by rendering a prompt and sending it to the language model for processing. The response from call_llm is then returned as the output of the breakdown_task method, indicating its role in task decomposition and interaction with the language model.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the configuration dictionary is properly populated with all necessary keys and values to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, be mindful of the API usage limits and the potential costs associated with calling the OpenAI API.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the call_llm function could be a string such as "To break down the task, consider the following steps: 1. Analyze the requirements, 2. Identify key components, 3. Create sub-tasks for each component."
