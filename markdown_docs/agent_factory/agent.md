## ClassDef BaseAgent
**BaseAgent**: The function of BaseAgent is to serve as a foundational class for managing interactions with a language model, handling queries, and maintaining a history of conversations.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· config: A configuration object that holds settings and parameters for the agent, loaded from a configuration file.
· model: The model to be used for generating responses, defaulting to "gpt-4o-mini" if not specified in the configuration.
· env: An Environment object that loads templates from a specified folder path for rendering prompts.
· queryDB: A set that stores unique queries to be processed.
· citationDB: A list of dictionaries that contains search queries and their corresponding results, specifically those that have received positive feedback.
· sys_prompt: A string that holds the system prompt used for guiding the language model's responses.
· repeat_turns: An integer that defines the maximum number of turns for repeated interactions.
· history: A list that maintains the history of interactions, storing both user queries and model responses.

**Code Description**: The BaseAgent class is designed to facilitate interactions with a language model by managing configurations, handling user queries, and maintaining a history of conversations. Upon initialization, it reads configuration settings, including the model to be used and the path for prompt templates. The class maintains a query database (queryDB) for storing unique queries and a citation database (citationDB) for tracking search results that have been positively acknowledged. 

The class provides several methods:
- `parallel_search(query_list)`: This method simulates parallel searching for a list of queries, although the actual implementation is not provided.
- `common_chat(query)`: This method sends a user query to the language model and appends both the user query and the model's response to the history.
- `clear_history()`: This method clears the conversation history.
- `chat_with_template(data, prompt_template)`: This method adapts a prompt template using provided data and sends the rendered prompt to the common chat method.
- `receive_task(task)`: This method accepts a task for processing.
- `extract_and_validate_yaml(model_response)`: This method extracts YAML content from a model response and validates it, returning the parsed YAML or None if invalid.

The class is structured to support extensibility and can be integrated into larger systems that require natural language processing capabilities.

**Note**: When using the BaseAgent class, ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up to avoid issues with loading models or templates. Additionally, be mindful of the structure of the citationDB to maintain consistency in storing search results.

**Output Example**: An example of a response from the `common_chat` method could be:
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": "Google faced challenges in 2019 due to various factors, including increased competition and regulatory scrutiny."
}
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the BaseAgent class, setting up its configuration and necessary attributes.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the BaseAgent class. It is responsible for initializing the instance variables that will be used throughout the class. 

1. **self.config**: This variable is assigned the result of the `read_config()` function, which presumably reads configuration settings from a file or other source. This configuration is essential for the operation of the agent, as it dictates how the agent will behave.

2. **self.model**: This variable retrieves the 'default_model' value from the configuration dictionary. If this key does not exist, it defaults to "gpt-4o-mini". This model will likely be used for generating responses or processing queries.

3. **self.env**: This variable creates an instance of the Environment class, using FileSystemLoader to load templates from a directory specified by the 'prompt_folder_path' key in the configuration. This setup suggests that the agent may utilize templates for generating prompts or responses.

4. **self.queryDB**: This is initialized as an empty set. It is intended to store unique queries that the agent will handle. Using a set ensures that each query is distinct and prevents duplicates.

5. **self.citationDB**: This variable is initialized as a list containing a single dictionary. The dictionary is structured to hold queries as keys, with each key mapping to a document_id that contains metadata about the document, such as its URL, title, and content. The comment indicates that only search results praised by critics will be included in this database.

6. **self.sys_prompt**: This is initialized as an empty string. It likely serves as a system prompt that can be modified or set later in the class's methods.

7. **self.repeat_turns**: This variable is set to 10, which may represent the number of times the agent will repeat a certain action or query during its operation.

8. **self.history**: This is initialized as an empty list. It is intended to keep track of the history of interactions or queries processed by the agent.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up and accessible, as the agent's behavior heavily relies on the parameters defined within it. Additionally, the structure of the citationDB should be maintained to ensure proper retrieval and storage of search results.
***
### FunctionDef parallel_search(self, query_list)
**parallel_search**: The function of parallel_search is to perform a simulated parallel search for a list of queries.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· query_list: A list of queries that need to be searched in parallel.

**Code Description**: The parallel_search function is designed to simulate a parallel search operation. It takes a list of queries as input through the parameter `query_list`. The function iterates over each query in the list, and for each query, it simulates a search result. The simulated search result is a dictionary containing three key-value pairs: "url", "title", and "content". The "url" points to a static link to Google, the "title" provides a brief headline related to Google, and the "content" gives a short description of the challenges faced by Google in 2019. However, it is important to note that the actual search operation is not implemented in this function, as it only simulates the results without performing any real search queries.

**Note**: It is essential to understand that this function does not return any results or perform actual searches; it merely simulates the process. Therefore, it should be used for testing or demonstration purposes only. Additionally, the function currently lacks error handling and does not account for varying query formats or types.
***
### FunctionDef common_chat(self, query)
**common_chat**: The function of common_chat is to facilitate interaction with a language model by sending a user query and storing the conversation history.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· query: A string representing the user's input or question that will be sent to the language model.

**Code Description**: The common_chat method is designed to handle user interactions with a language model. It takes a single parameter, `query`, which is the input from the user. The method begins by invoking the `call_llm` function, passing the model, system prompt, user prompt (the query), and configuration settings. This function is responsible for communicating with the language model and retrieving a response based on the provided inputs.

Once the response from the language model is obtained, the method updates the conversation history by appending two entries: one for the user's query and another for the assistant's response. This history is stored in the `self.history` list, which allows for tracking the dialogue over time.

The common_chat function is called by the chat_with_template method, which serves as a preparatory step for generating a dynamic prompt based on input data. In chat_with_template, the prompt is rendered using a template and the relevant data, resulting in a `rendered_prompt`. This rendered prompt is then passed to common_chat as the query parameter. The response from common_chat is returned as the output of chat_with_template, establishing a clear functional relationship between the two methods.

This design allows for a structured conversation flow, where chat_with_template formats the input into a suitable prompt, and common_chat processes this prompt to obtain a response from the language model, while also maintaining a history of the interaction.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the query passed to common_chat is well-formed and relevant to the context of the conversation. This will enhance the quality of the response generated by the language model.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the common_chat function could be a string such as "I'm here to help! What do you need assistance with?" This response will depend on the specific query provided and the context established in the conversation history.
***
### FunctionDef clear_history(self)
**clear_history**: The function of clear_history is to reset the history of the agent by clearing all stored entries.

**parameters**: The clear_history function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The clear_history function is a method defined within the BaseAgent class. When invoked, it sets the instance variable `history` to an empty list. This effectively removes all previous entries stored in the `history`, allowing the agent to start fresh without any prior context or data. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where the agent needs to discard past interactions or data, ensuring that it operates without any influence from previous states. The simplicity of this function underscores its importance in maintaining the integrity of the agent's operational state.

**Note**: It is important to use the clear_history function judiciously, as invoking it will permanently erase all historical data associated with the agent. This action cannot be undone, so it should be called only when it is certain that the historical data is no longer needed.
***
### FunctionDef chat_with_template(self, data, prompt_template)
**chat_with_template**: The function of chat_with_template is to facilitate a conversation by rendering a prompt template with provided data and then communicating with a language model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· data: A dictionary containing key-value pairs that will be used to populate the prompt template.
· prompt_template: An object that defines the structure of the prompt to be rendered, which will be filled with the values from the data dictionary.

**Code Description**: The chat_with_template method is designed to generate a dynamic prompt for a conversation based on the input data. It takes two parameters: `data`, which is a dictionary containing the necessary information to fill in the prompt template, and `prompt_template`, which is an object that specifies how the prompt should be structured. 

The method begins by rendering the prompt using the `render` method of the `prompt_template`, passing the unpacked `data` dictionary as keyword arguments. This results in a `rendered_prompt`, which is a string that represents the final prompt to be sent to the language model.

Following the rendering process, the method calls `common_chat`, passing the `rendered_prompt` as the `query` parameter. The `common_chat` function is responsible for sending this query to a language model, allowing for interaction based on the generated prompt. The response from `common_chat` is then returned as the output of the `chat_with_template` method.

This establishes a clear functional relationship where `chat_with_template` serves as a preparatory step that formats the input data into a suitable prompt, which is then processed by `common_chat` to obtain a response from the language model.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the `data` provided is complete and correctly structured to match the expectations of the `prompt_template`. This will ensure that the rendered prompt is coherent and relevant, leading to meaningful interactions with the language model.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the chat_with_template function could be a string such as "Hello! How can I assist you today?" This response will depend on the specific data provided and the structure of the prompt template used.
***
### FunctionDef receive_task(self, task)
**receive_task**: The function of receive_task is to accept and store the original task provided to the agent.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· task: This parameter represents the original task that is being received by the agent. It is expected to be of any data type that encapsulates the task details.

**Code Description**: The receive_task function is designed to accept a task as input and assign it to the instance variable original_task. This function serves as a method for the BaseAgent class, allowing it to receive tasks that it will process or manage later. When the function is called, it takes the provided task and directly assigns it to the instance variable self.original_task. This action effectively stores the task within the agent's context, making it accessible for further operations or processing within the agent's lifecycle.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the task being passed to this function is properly formatted and contains all necessary information required for the agent to perform its intended operations. Additionally, this function does not perform any validation or processing on the task; it simply stores it. Therefore, any necessary checks or transformations should be handled before invoking this method.
***
### FunctionDef extract_and_validate_yaml(self, model_response)
**extract_and_validate_yaml**: The function of extract_and_validate_yaml is to extract YAML content from a given string and validate its syntax.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model_response: A string input that potentially contains YAML content wrapped in ```yaml``` markers.

**Code Description**: The extract_and_validate_yaml function begins by importing the regular expression module (re) to facilitate pattern matching. It uses a regular expression to search for content that is enclosed between ```yaml``` markers in the provided model_response string. The pattern `r'```yaml\n([\s\S]*?)\n```'` is designed to capture everything between the opening and closing markers, including newlines and whitespace.

If the search does not find a match, the function returns None, indicating that no valid YAML content was found. If a match is found, the captured content is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. The function then attempts to parse this YAML content using the yaml.safe_load method from the PyYAML library. If the parsing is successful, it returns the YAML content formatted as a string using yaml.dump, with default_flow_style set to False for a more human-readable format.

In the event of a parsing error, the function catches the yaml.YAMLError exception, prints an error message indicating that the YAML content is invalid, and returns None.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input string contains valid YAML syntax wrapped in the specified markers. If the input does not conform to this structure, the function will return None without raising an error.

**Output Example**: If the input model_response is:
```
Here is some configuration:
```yaml
key: value
list:
  - item1
  - item2
```
```
The function would return:
```
key:
  value
list:
- item1
- item2
```
