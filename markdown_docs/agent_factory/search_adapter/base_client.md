## ClassDef BaseSearchClient
**BaseSearchClient**: The function of BaseSearchClient is to define an abstract interface for search clients that implement a search functionality.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
路 query: A string representing the search query that the client will process.  
路 kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to customize the search behavior.

**Code Description**: The BaseSearchClient class is an abstract base class that inherits from the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module in Python. It serves as a blueprint for creating specific search client implementations. The class contains a single abstract method, `search`, which must be implemented by any subclass that derives from BaseSearchClient. This method takes a string parameter `query`, which represents the search term or phrase, and accepts additional keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) that allow for flexible search configurations. The use of the `@abstractmethod` decorator indicates that subclasses are required to provide their own implementation of the `search` method, ensuring that any concrete search client adheres to this interface.

**Note**: It is important to remember that since BaseSearchClient is an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated directly. Developers must create subclasses that implement the `search` method to utilize its functionality. This design pattern promotes code reusability and enforces a consistent interface across different search client implementations.
### FunctionDef search(self, query)
**search**: The function of search is to perform a search operation based on the provided query.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 query: A string that represents the search term or phrase to be used in the search operation.
路 kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to modify the behavior of the search function.

**Code Description**: The search function is designed to accept a search query as a string and any number of additional keyword arguments. The function currently has no implemented logic, as indicated by the use of the `pass` statement. This suggests that the function is intended to be overridden or extended in subclasses or future implementations. The flexibility provided by the `**kwargs` parameter allows for the inclusion of various optional parameters that may influence the search process, such as filters, sorting options, or pagination settings. However, without a concrete implementation, the specific behavior and expected outcomes of the search function remain undefined.

**Note**: It is important to implement the search logic in subclasses or to ensure that this function is properly defined before invoking it. Users should be aware that calling this function in its current state will not yield any results or perform any operations.
