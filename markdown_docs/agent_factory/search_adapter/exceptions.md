## ClassDef UsageLimitExceededError
**UsageLimitExceededError**: The function of UsageLimitExceededError is to signal that a predefined usage limit has been exceeded in the application.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· message: A string that provides a description of the error encountered.

**Code Description**: The UsageLimitExceededError class is a custom exception that inherits from Python's built-in Exception class. It is designed to be raised when a user or process exceeds a specified usage limit within the application. The constructor of the class takes a single parameter, `message`, which is expected to be a string. This message is passed to the superclass constructor using `super().__init__(message)`, allowing the exception to carry a descriptive message that can be used for debugging or logging purposes. By extending the base Exception class, UsageLimitExceededError can be caught and handled specifically in exception handling blocks, enabling developers to implement tailored responses to usage limit violations.

**Note**: When using this exception, it is important to ensure that the message provided is clear and informative, as it will be crucial for understanding the context of the error when it is raised. This exception should be used in scenarios where usage limits are enforced, such as API rate limits, subscription service limits, or other resource constraints.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the UsageLimitExceededError class with a specific error message.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: A string that represents the error message to be associated with the exception.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the UsageLimitExceededError class, which is likely a custom exception class used to indicate that a certain usage limit has been exceeded. This function takes a single parameter, message, which is expected to be a string. The function calls the constructor of its superclass (presumably Exception or a subclass thereof) using the super() function, passing the message parameter to it. This ensures that the error message is properly set in the base exception class, allowing it to be retrieved later when the exception is raised or caught. The use of super() is a common practice in Python to maintain the inheritance chain and ensure that the base class is initialized correctly.

**Note**: It is important to provide a clear and descriptive message when raising this exception, as it will help users of the code understand the specific reason for the error.
***
## ClassDef BadRequestError
**BadRequestError**: The function of BadRequestError is to represent an error that occurs when a client sends a request that is malformed or invalid.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· message: A string that describes the error encountered.

**Code Description**: The BadRequestError class is a custom exception that inherits from the built-in Exception class in Python. It is designed to be raised when a bad request is encountered, typically in the context of web applications or APIs where the input provided by the client does not meet the expected format or criteria. The constructor of the class takes a single parameter, `message`, which is a string that provides a detailed description of the error. This message is passed to the superclass constructor using the `super()` function, ensuring that the base Exception class is properly initialized with the error message. This allows the error message to be retrieved later when the exception is caught and handled.

**Note**: When using the BadRequestError class, it is important to provide a clear and informative message to help identify the specific issue with the request. This will aid in debugging and improve the overall user experience by providing meaningful feedback.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the BadRequestError class with a specific error message.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: A string that represents the error message to be associated with the BadRequestError instance.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the BadRequestError class, which is likely a custom exception class used to signal a bad request error in an application. This method takes a single parameter, message, which is expected to be a string. The constructor first calls the __init__ method of its superclass (presumably Exception or a subclass thereof) using the super() function, passing the message parameter to it. This ensures that the base class is properly initialized with the provided error message, allowing the error to be raised with a descriptive message that can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.

**Note**: It is important to provide a clear and concise error message when raising this exception, as it will help in understanding the context of the error when it is caught and handled in the application.

## ClassDef InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError
**InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError**: The function of InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError is to signal an error when an invalid Tavily API key is encountered.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· message: A string that describes the error encountered.

**Code Description**: The InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError class is a custom exception that inherits from the built-in Exception class in Python. It is specifically designed to handle scenarios where an invalid API key is provided when interacting with the Tavily API. The constructor of this class calls the constructor of the parent Exception class with a predefined error message, "Tavily API key invalid." This message is intended to provide clarity to the developer or user regarding the nature of the error, making it evident that the issue lies with the API key being used.

When this exception is raised, it indicates that the operation requiring a valid Tavily API key cannot proceed, thus allowing developers to implement error handling mechanisms to manage such situations appropriately.

**Note**: It is important to use this exception in contexts where API key validation is performed. Developers should ensure that they catch this specific exception to provide meaningful feedback to users or to log the error for further investigation.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError class with a specific error message.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError class, which is likely a custom exception class designed to handle errors related to invalid API keys for the Tavily service. Within this function, the super() function is called to invoke the constructor of the parent class, passing the string "Tavily API key invalid." as an argument. This string serves as the error message that will be associated with the exception when it is raised. By calling the parent class's constructor, the InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError class inherits all the properties and methods of its parent class, ensuring that it behaves like a standard exception while also providing a specific error message that can be used for debugging or logging purposes.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that this exception is raised in appropriate contexts where an invalid Tavily API key is encountered, allowing for proper error handling in applications that utilize the Tavily API.
