## ClassDef SearchAggregator
**SearchAggregator**: The function of SearchAggregator is to perform search operations using the Tavily client and return search results.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
路 default_client: An instance of the TavilyClient, which is used to perform search operations.

**Code Description**: The SearchAggregator class is designed to facilitate search operations by utilizing the Tavily client. Upon initialization, it creates a default client instance of TavilyClient, which is responsible for executing search queries. The class contains a method called `search`, which takes a search query as a string and an optional list of search engines. However, the current implementation only supports the Tavily client, and the engines parameter is ignored. The `search` method directly invokes the `search` method of the default_client with the provided query and returns a SearchResponse object from Tavily.

The `__init__` method initializes the default_client attribute, ensuring that the Tavily client is ready for use when an instance of SearchAggregator is created. The `search` method is the primary interface for users to perform searches, and it is expected to return the results in the form of a SearchResponse object, which encapsulates the search results from the Tavily client.

**Note**: It is important to note that the current implementation does not support multiple search engines, as the engines parameter is not utilized. Users should be aware that any search operation will default to using the Tavily client exclusively.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a SearchResponse object containing search results such as:
```
{
    "results": [
        {
            "title": "Example Result 1",
            "url": "http://example.com/1",
            "snippet": "This is a snippet of the first example result."
        },
        {
            "title": "Example Result 2",
            "url": "http://example.com/2",
            "snippet": "This is a snippet of the second example result."
        }
    ],
    "total_results": 2
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the SearchAggregator class with a default client.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a special method in Python, commonly known as a constructor. It is automatically called when an instance of the class is created. In this implementation, the __init__ method initializes the instance by creating a default client using the TavilyClient class. This means that whenever a new instance of the SearchAggregator class is instantiated, it will have a default client ready for use, which is essential for the functionality of the aggregator. The TavilyClient is presumably a predefined client that facilitates communication or interaction with a specific service or API, although the details of the TavilyClient class are not provided in this snippet.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the TavilyClient class is properly defined and accessible within the scope of the SearchAggregator class. Additionally, any dependencies or configurations required by TavilyClient should be addressed to avoid runtime errors when initializing the SearchAggregator instance.

### FunctionDef search(self, query, engines)
**search**: The function of search is to perform a search operation using the Tavily search engine and return the corresponding search results.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 query: A string representing the search keywords that the user wants to search for.
路 engines: An optional list of search engines to be used for the search operation (currently ignored in the implementation).

**Code Description**: The search function is designed to facilitate searching for information based on a specified query. It accepts a single mandatory parameter, `query`, which is a string containing the keywords for the search. Additionally, there is an optional parameter, `engines`, which allows the user to specify a list of search engines; however, this parameter is currently not utilized in the function's implementation. 

The function is implemented to exclusively support the Tavily search engine. When invoked, it calls the `search` method of the `default_client`, which is presumably an instance of a client configured to interact with Tavily. The function returns a `SearchResponse` object that contains the results of the search operation performed by Tavily.

**Note**: It is important to note that the function currently does not support multiple search engines, as the `engines` parameter is ignored. Users should ensure that the `default_client` is properly initialized and configured to communicate with Tavily before calling this function.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a `SearchResponse` object containing fields such as `results`, `total_results`, and `query_time`, which provide the search results, the total number of results found, and the time taken to perform the search, respectively. For instance:

```
SearchResponse(
    results=[{'title': 'Example Result 1', 'link': 'http://example.com/1'}, 
             {'title': 'Example Result 2', 'link': 'http://example.com/2'}],
    total_results=2,
    query_time=0.123
)
```
