## ClassDef SearchAggregator
**SearchAggregator**: The function of SearchAggregator is to facilitate search operations using the Tavily client.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
路 default_client: An instance of the TavilyClient, which is used as the primary client for executing search queries.

**Code Description**: The SearchAggregator class is designed to perform search operations by utilizing the TavilyClient. Upon initialization, it creates a default client instance of TavilyClient, which is used for executing search queries. The class contains a method named `search`, which takes a search query as a string and an optional list of search engines. However, the current implementation only supports the Tavily search engine, as indicated by the comment in the code. The `search` method directly calls the `search` method of the default client to retrieve search results based on the provided query. The method returns a SearchResponse object that contains the results of the search operation.

**Note**: It is important to note that the `engines` parameter in the `search` method is currently ignored, as the implementation is limited to the Tavily client. Users should be aware that future enhancements may include support for additional search engines.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the `search` method could be a SearchResponse object containing a list of search results, such as:
```
SearchResponse(results=[{"title": "Example Result 1", "url": "http://example.com/1"}, {"title": "Example Result 2", "url": "http://example.com/2"}])
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the SearchAggregator class with a default client.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a special method in Python, commonly known as a constructor. It is automatically called when an instance of the class is created. In this implementation, the __init__ method initializes the instance by creating a default client using the TavilyClient class. This means that whenever a new instance of the SearchAggregator class is instantiated, it will have a default client ready for use, which is essential for the functionality of the aggregator. The TavilyClient is presumably a predefined client that facilitates communication or interaction with a specific service or API, although the details of the TavilyClient class are not provided in this snippet.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the TavilyClient class is properly defined and accessible within the scope of the SearchAggregator class. Additionally, any dependencies or configurations required by TavilyClient should be addressed to avoid runtime errors when initializing the SearchAggregator instance.

### FunctionDef search(self, query, engines)
**search**: The function of search is to perform a search operation using a specified query and return the search results.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 query: A string representing the search keywords that the user wants to search for.
路 engines: An optional list of strings representing the search engines to be used for the search (currently ignored).

**Code Description**: The search function is designed to execute a search operation using the provided query. By default, it utilizes the Tavily search engine to retrieve search results. The function accepts two parameters: 'query', which is a mandatory string input that specifies the keywords for the search, and 'engines', which is an optional parameter that allows the user to specify a list of search engines. However, in the current implementation, the 'engines' parameter is not utilized, and the function directly calls the search method of the default client, which is configured to use Tavily. The result of this search operation is returned as a SearchResponse object.

**Note**: It is important to note that the current implementation only supports the Tavily search engine, and any input provided in the 'engines' parameter will be ignored. Users should ensure that the query parameter is a valid string to avoid errors during the search operation.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a SearchResponse object containing a list of search results relevant to the provided query, such as:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Example Result 1",
      "url": "http://example.com/result1",
      "snippet": "This is a snippet of the first result."
    },
    {
      "title": "Example Result 2",
      "url": "http://example.com/result2",
      "snippet": "This is a snippet of the second result."
    }
  ],
  "total_results": 2
}
```
