## ClassDef SearchResult
**SearchResult**: The function of SearchResult is to represent the outcome of a search query, encapsulating relevant details about each result.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· title: A string representing the title of the search result.  
· url: A string containing the URL link to the resource associated with the search result.  
· content: A string that provides a brief description or content summary of the search result.  
· score: A float indicating the relevance score of the search result, which can be used to rank the results.  
· published_date: An optional string that denotes the date when the content was published, providing context for the search result.

**Code Description**: The SearchResult class is a data model that inherits from BaseModel, designed to encapsulate the essential attributes of a search result returned from a search operation. Each instance of SearchResult contains a title, URL, content summary, relevance score, and an optional published date. This structure allows for a clear representation of search results, making it easier for developers to handle and display search data in their applications.

The SearchResult class is utilized within the SearchResponse class, which serves as a container for multiple search results. The SearchResponse class includes a query string that represents the search term used, a list of SearchResult instances that hold the actual results, and a response_time float that indicates how long the search operation took. This relationship highlights the role of SearchResult as a fundamental building block of the search response, enabling developers to manage and present search results effectively.

**Note**: When using the SearchResult class, it is important to ensure that the attributes are populated with valid data to maintain the integrity of the search results. Additionally, since published_date is optional, developers should handle cases where this attribute may not be provided to avoid potential errors in data processing or display.
## ClassDef SearchResponse
**SearchResponse**: The function of SearchResponse is to encapsulate the results of a search query, including the query string, the list of search results, and the response time.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· query: A string representing the search term that was used for the query.  
· results: A list of SearchResult instances that contain the individual outcomes of the search query. This list is initialized with an empty list by default.  
· response_time: A float indicating the duration of the search operation, measured in seconds.

**Code Description**: The SearchResponse class is a data model that inherits from BaseModel, designed to represent the outcome of a search operation. It includes three key attributes: `query`, `results`, and `response_time`. The `query` attribute holds the search term that was input by the user, providing context for the results returned. The `results` attribute is a list that contains instances of the SearchResult class, which encapsulate the details of each individual search result. This allows for a structured representation of multiple search outcomes, making it easier for developers to manage and display the data. The `response_time` attribute records the time taken to execute the search, which can be useful for performance monitoring and optimization.

The relationship between SearchResponse and SearchResult is integral, as SearchResponse acts as a container for multiple SearchResult instances. Each SearchResult provides detailed information about a specific search outcome, including attributes such as title, URL, content summary, relevance score, and an optional published date. This structure allows developers to effectively handle and present search results in their applications, ensuring that users receive comprehensive and relevant information based on their queries.

**Note**: When utilizing the SearchResponse class, it is important to ensure that the `results` attribute is populated with valid SearchResult instances to maintain the integrity of the search response. Additionally, developers should consider the implications of the `response_time` attribute for user experience, as longer response times may affect the perceived performance of the search functionality.
