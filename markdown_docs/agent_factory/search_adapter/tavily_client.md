## ClassDef TavilyClient
**TavilyClient**: The function of TavilyClient is to interact with the Tavily API, providing search capabilities for various topics and query parameters.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· base_url: A string representing the base URL of the Tavily API (default is "https://api.tavily.com").
· _api_key: A string containing the API key used for authentication with the Tavily API (default is "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").
· headers: A dictionary defining the headers for HTTP requests, with the content type set to "application/json".

**Code Description**: 
The `TavilyClient` class is designed to interact with the Tavily API for performing search operations. It inherits from `BaseSearchClient`, which likely provides shared functionality for other search-related clients.

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - The constructor initializes the client with default values:
     - `base_url` is set to the Tavily API's endpoint.
     - `_api_key` is a fixed string representing the API key required to authenticate requests to the Tavily API.
     - `headers` is a dictionary with the content-type header set to "application/json" for all requests.
   
2. **Search Method (`search` method)**:
   - This method is used to send a search request to the Tavily API. It takes several parameters:
     - `query` (str): The search query to be executed.
     - `search_depth` (Literal): A string specifying the search depth, which can either be "basic" or "advanced". Defaults to "basic".
     - `topic` (Literal): Specifies the topic for the search. Can be "general" or "news". Defaults to "general".
     - `days` (int): Defines the number of past days to include in the search. Defaults to 7.
     - `max_results` (int): Limits the maximum number of results returned. Defaults to 10.
   
   - Inside the method:
     - A dictionary `data` is created, containing all the search parameters and the API key.
     - An HTTP POST request is sent to the Tavily API's `/search` endpoint using the `httpx.Client` object. A timeout of 30 seconds is set for the request.
     - If the response status is 200 (OK), the response JSON is returned.
     - If the status is 429 (Too Many Requests), an exception (`UsageLimitExceededError`) is raised, detailing that the rate limit has been exceeded.
     - If the status is 401 (Unauthorized), an exception (`InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError`) is raised, indicating an invalid API key.
     - If the status code is any other error, the `raise_for_status()` method triggers an HTTP error.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the response status is 429, the method tries to extract more detailed error information from the response JSON, but defaults to "Too many requests" if the information is unavailable.
   - If the API key is invalid (HTTP status 401), an `InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError` is raised, signaling authentication issues.
   - For other HTTP errors, the standard error handling (`raise_for_status`) is triggered to propagate any non-2xx response as an exception.

4. **Search Response**:
   - If the search is successful, the response is validated and returned as a `SearchResponse` object using its `model_validate` method.

**Note**: 
- The `TavilyClient` assumes the use of a valid API key for authentication. Ensure that the key is kept secure and updated.
- The method `search` handles errors related to rate limiting (HTTP 429) and authentication (HTTP 401), but other types of HTTP errors are raised directly as exceptions.
- The default values for search parameters are set to provide a basic, general search from the past week with a maximum of 10 results. These defaults can be adjusted as needed.

**Output Example**: 
Assuming a successful search request, the return value would be a JSON object representing the search results, possibly structured as follows:

```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "title": "Example Article 1",
            "url": "https://example.com/article1",
            "snippet": "This is a summary of article 1.",
            "published_date": "2024-11-20"
        },
        {
            "title": "Example Article 2",
            "url": "https://example.com/article2",
            "snippet": "This is a summary of article 2.",
            "published_date": "2024-11-19"
        }
    ],
    "total_results": 2
}
```

In case of an error due to rate limiting, the returned JSON might look like this:

```json
{
    "detail": {
        "error": "Too many requests."
    }
}
```


### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the TavilyClient class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a special method in Python that is automatically called when a new instance of the TavilyClient class is created. This method sets up the initial state of the object by defining several attributes. 

1. `self.base_url`: This attribute is initialized with the string "https://api.tavily.com", which represents the base URL for the Tavily API. This URL will be used as the endpoint for making API requests.

2. `self._api_key`: This attribute is initialized with a string value "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". This is a placeholder for the API key required for authenticating requests to the Tavily API. It is prefixed with an underscore, indicating that it is intended for internal use within the class.

3. `self.headers`: This attribute is initialized as a dictionary containing a single key-value pair. The key is "Content-Type", and the value is "application/json". This header indicates that the data being sent to the API will be in JSON format, which is a common format for API communication.

Overall, the __init__ method establishes the necessary configuration for the TavilyClient instance, ensuring that it has the required URL, API key, and headers for making API calls.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the API key is kept secure and not exposed in public repositories or shared environments, as it grants access to the Tavily API. Additionally, users should replace the placeholder API key with their own valid key to successfully interact with the API.
***
### FunctionDef search(self, query, search_depth, topic, days, max_results)
**search**: The function of search is to send a request to the API to perform a search based on the provided parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· query: A string representing the search query to be executed.
· search_depth: A literal value that determines the depth of the search, which can be either "basic" or "advanced". The default value is "basic".
· topic: A literal value that specifies the topic of the search, which can be either "general" or "news". The default value is "general".
· days: An integer indicating the number of days to look back for search results. The default value is 7.
· max_results: An integer that sets the maximum number of results to return. The default value is 10.

**Code Description**: The search function is designed to interact with an external API to retrieve search results based on the specified parameters. It constructs a data dictionary containing the search parameters, including the query, search depth, topic, days, maximum results, and the API key. The function then creates an HTTP client using the httpx library with a timeout of 30 seconds. It sends a POST request to the API endpoint for searching, appending the data as a JSON payload and including necessary headers.

Upon receiving a response, the function checks the status code:
- If the status code is 200, it means the request was successful, and the function returns the parsed JSON response as a SearchResponse object.
- If the status code is 429, it indicates that the user has exceeded the allowed number of requests. In this case, the function attempts to extract a detailed error message from the response and raises a UsageLimitExceededError with that message.
- If the status code is 401, it signifies an invalid API key, and the function raises an InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError.
- For any other unsuccessful status codes, the function raises an HTTPStatusError.

The function ensures that the response is validated and structured as a SearchResponse model before returning it.

**Note**: It is important to handle exceptions properly when using this function, especially for the cases of exceeding request limits or invalid API keys. Users should ensure that they have a valid API key and are aware of the rate limits imposed by the API.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "results": [
        {
            "title": "Example News Article",
            "link": "https://example.com/news/article",
            "published_date": "2023-10-01",
            "snippet": "This is a brief summary of the news article."
        },
        ...
    ],
    "total_results": 5
}
