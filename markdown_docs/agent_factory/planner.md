## ClassDef Planner
**Planner**: The function of Planner is to create and execute a plan to achieve a specified goal using a large language model (LLM) and a defined set of available nodes.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· llm_model: An instance of a large language model used to generate actions based on the current state.
· goal: The target state that the planner aims to achieve.
· available_nodes: A collection of nodes that can be utilized in the planning process.
· complexity: A measure of the complexity of the planning task.
· global_context: Contextual information that may influence the planning process.
· evaluator: An object responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of actions taken.

**Code Description**: The Planner class is designed to facilitate the planning process in a structured manner. It utilizes a priority queue to manage states that need to be explored, implementing a variant of the Q* algorithm. The planning process begins with an initial state, which is added to the open set. The algorithm iteratively explores states, checking if the current state meets the goal. If the goal is reached, the path taken to achieve it is reconstructed and returned. 

The class contains several key methods:
- `plan(initial_state)`: This method initiates the planning process. It maintains an open set of states to explore, tracks the cost of reaching each state, and determines the best path to the goal based on the actions generated by the LLM and the rewards evaluated by the evaluator.
- `get_actions(state)`: This method generates a prompt based on the current state and uses the LLM to produce a list of possible actions. The actions are then parsed into a usable format.
- `transition(state, action)`: This method is intended to apply a given action to the current state to derive the next state. The implementation details for this method are not provided in the code.
- `is_goal(state)`: This method checks if the current state satisfies the goal condition.
- `heuristic(state)`: This method is meant to estimate the cost to reach the goal from the current state, although its implementation is not provided.
- `reconstruct_path(came_from, current_state)`: This method reconstructs the path taken from the initial state to the goal state based on the actions taken.
- `generate_action_prompt(state)`: This method generates a prompt for the LLM to decide on actions based on the current state.
- `parse_actions(action_descriptions)`: This method converts the output from the LLM into actionable items.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the LLM model and evaluator are properly configured before using the Planner class. Additionally, the transition and heuristic methods require implementation for the class to function fully.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the `plan` method could be a sequence of actions leading from the initial state to the goal state, such as:
```
[Action1, Action2, Action3]
``` 
This output indicates the steps taken to achieve the specified goal, based on the planning process executed by the Planner class.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that all parameters are provided with appropriate values when creating an instance of the Planner class, as they directly affect the functionality and effectiveness of the planning process.
***
### FunctionDef plan(self, initial_state)
**plan**: The function of plan is to implement the Q* algorithm for pathfinding from an initial state to a goal state.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· initial_state: The starting state from which the planning process begins, representing the current configuration of the system.

**Code Description**: The plan function is a core component of the Planner class, designed to find an optimal path from a given initial state to a goal state using a variant of the Q* algorithm. The function begins by initializing a priority queue called open_set, which is used to explore states based on their cost. The initial state is added to this queue with a priority of zero, indicating that it is the starting point of the search.

The function maintains two dictionaries: came_from, which tracks the state transitions, and cost_so_far, which records the cumulative cost to reach each state. The algorithm operates in a loop that continues until there are no more states to explore in the open_set. Within this loop, the current state is retrieved from the priority queue, and the function checks if this state meets the goal criteria by invoking the is_goal method. If the goal is reached, the function calls reconstruct_path to backtrack and return the sequence of states leading to the goal.

If the current state is not the goal, the function retrieves possible actions for the current state using the get_actions method. For each action, it computes the next state by applying the transition function. The cost associated with this action is evaluated using the evaluator's evaluate_action method, which generates a reward. The new cost is calculated by subtracting this reward from the current state's cost, effectively treating the reward as a negative cost.

The function then checks if the next state has been encountered before or if the new cost is lower than any previously recorded cost for that state. If either condition is satisfied, the cost for the next state is updated, and its priority is calculated by adding the new cost to the heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal from the next state. The next state is then added to the open_set for further exploration, and the came_from dictionary is updated to reflect the transition from the current state to the next state.

If the open_set is exhausted without finding a valid plan, the function returns None, indicating that no path to the goal could be found. The plan function is thus integral to the overall planning process, coordinating the exploration of states, action generation, cost evaluation, and path reconstruction.

**Note**: It is essential that the methods is_goal, get_actions, transition, evaluator.evaluate_action, and heuristic are correctly implemented for the plan function to operate effectively. The performance and accuracy of the pathfinding algorithm depend heavily on these components working together seamlessly.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the plan function could be a list of states representing the path taken from the initial state to the goal state, such as: [state1, state2, state3, ..., goal_state]. If no valid plan is found, the output would be None.
***
### FunctionDef get_actions(self, state)
**get_actions**: The function of get_actions is to determine a list of actions based on the current state using a Large Language Model (LLM).

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· state: This parameter represents the current state of the system or environment that is used to generate the actions.

**Code Description**: The get_actions function is responsible for generating a list of actionable items based on the current state of the system. It accomplishes this by first creating a prompt that encapsulates the relevant details of the state through the generate_action_prompt method. This prompt is then passed to the LLM model, which generates descriptions of potential actions. The output from the LLM, referred to as action_descriptions, is subsequently processed by the parse_actions method to convert these descriptions into a structured format suitable for execution.

The get_actions function is a critical component within the Planner class, as it serves as the intermediary between the state of the system and the action generation process facilitated by the LLM. It relies on the generate_action_prompt function to accurately reflect the current context, ensuring that the LLM can provide relevant action suggestions. The relationship with parse_actions is equally important, as this function transforms the raw output from the LLM into actionable items that can be utilized by other parts of the application.

The get_actions function is invoked by the plan method of the Planner class. Within the plan method, get_actions is called repeatedly as the algorithm explores different states in search of a goal. The actions returned by get_actions are used to determine the next state in the planning process, making it an essential part of the overall functionality of the planning algorithm.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that both the generate_action_prompt and parse_actions functions are properly implemented. The effectiveness of get_actions hinges on the quality of the prompt generated and the accuracy of the parsing logic, as these elements directly influence the relevance and usability of the actions produced.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from get_actions could be a list of actions such as: ["move_forward", "turn_left", "pick_up_object"].
***
### FunctionDef transition(self, state, action)
**transition**: The function of transition is to apply an action to a given state to determine the next state.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: state - The current state from which the action will be applied.  
· parameter2: action - The action to be applied to the current state.

**Code Description**: The transition function is designed to take a current state and an action as inputs, and it is expected to compute the resulting next state after the action is applied. However, the actual implementation of this function is currently a placeholder (indicated by the `pass` statement), meaning that it does not perform any operations or return any values at this time.

This function is called within the plan method of the Planner class. The plan method implements a pathfinding algorithm (specifically a variant of the Q* algorithm) that seeks to find an optimal path from an initial state to a goal state. During its execution, the plan method retrieves possible actions for the current state and utilizes the transition function to compute the next state that results from applying each action. The next state is then evaluated to determine the cost associated with that action, which is crucial for the algorithm's decision-making process.

The relationship between the transition function and the plan method is integral, as the transition function is a key component in determining the state space exploration of the algorithm. Without a proper implementation of the transition function, the plan method would be unable to progress through the state space effectively, rendering the pathfinding process incomplete.

**Note**: It is important to implement the transition function to ensure that it accurately reflects the dynamics of the system being modeled. The correctness of the pathfinding algorithm heavily relies on the proper functioning of this transition mechanism.
***
### FunctionDef is_goal(self, state)
**is_goal**: The function of is_goal is to determine if the specified goal has been achieved based on the current state.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· state: An object representing the current state of the system, which includes information necessary to evaluate whether the goal has been met.

**Code Description**: The is_goal function checks if the current state meets the predefined goal criteria. It does this by calling the meets_goal method on the state object, passing the goal attribute of the Planner instance as an argument. This function is crucial in the planning process, as it serves as a condition to identify when a valid plan has been successfully executed. 

The is_goal function is called within the plan method of the Planner class. In the plan method, a priority queue is utilized to explore possible states starting from an initial state. As the algorithm iterates through the states, it checks each current state against the goal using the is_goal function. If the current state meets the goal, the plan method will reconstruct and return the path taken to reach that state. If no valid plan is found, the plan method will return None. Thus, the is_goal function plays a pivotal role in the decision-making process of the planning algorithm, directly influencing the flow of state exploration and the eventual outcome of the planning operation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the state object passed to the is_goal function has a properly defined meets_goal method that can accurately assess the achievement of the goal.

**Output Example**: If the current state meets the goal, the function will return True; otherwise, it will return False. For instance, if the state object has a meets_goal method that evaluates to True when the goal conditions are satisfied, the output would be True.
***
### FunctionDef heuristic(self, state)
**heuristic**: The function of heuristic is to estimate the cost to reach the goal from the current state.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· state: The current state from which the cost to the goal is estimated.

**Code Description**: The heuristic function is designed to provide an estimation of the cost required to reach a goal state from a given current state. This estimation is crucial for guiding the search algorithm towards the goal efficiently. The function currently contains a placeholder implementation (indicated by the `pass` statement), which means it does not perform any calculations or return any values at this time.

The heuristic function is called within the `plan` method of the Planner class. In the context of the `plan` method, the heuristic is used to calculate the priority of the next state in the priority queue. Specifically, after determining the new cost of reaching a potential next state (factoring in the reward from the evaluator), the heuristic function is invoked to add an estimated cost to the goal. This combined value (new cost plus heuristic estimate) is then used to prioritize states in the open set, which is a priority queue that manages the states to be explored. The effectiveness of the heuristic function directly impacts the efficiency of the planning process, as it influences the order in which states are explored.

**Note**: It is important to implement the heuristic function with a suitable estimation strategy that reflects the specific problem domain. A well-designed heuristic can significantly improve the performance of the planning algorithm by reducing the number of states that need to be explored.
***
### FunctionDef reconstruct_path(self, came_from, current_state)
**reconstruct_path**: The function of reconstruct_path is to reconstruct the path from the start state to the goal state based on the information about where each state came from.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: came_from - A dictionary that maps each state to the state it came from, which is used to trace back the path taken.
· parameter2: current_state - The state at which the path reconstruction should end, typically the goal state.

**Code Description**: The reconstruct_path function is designed to take two parameters: came_from and current_state. The came_from parameter is a dictionary that records the relationship between states, specifically which state led to which other state during the planning process. The current_state parameter represents the final state that has been reached, usually the goal state. 

Although the function body is currently a placeholder (pass), its intended purpose is to utilize the came_from dictionary to backtrack from the current_state to the initial state, effectively reconstructing the sequence of states that were traversed to reach the goal. This is crucial in pathfinding algorithms, where understanding the route taken is as important as finding the route itself.

The reconstruct_path function is called within the plan method of the Planner class. The plan method implements a pathfinding algorithm (specifically a variant of the Q* algorithm) that explores possible actions from an initial state until it finds a goal state. When the goal state is identified, the plan method invokes reconstruct_path, passing the came_from dictionary and the current_state (goal state) to retrieve the complete path taken from the initial state to the goal. This relationship highlights the importance of reconstruct_path in providing a meaningful output after the planning process has concluded.

**Note**: As the reconstruct_path function is currently not implemented, developers should ensure that the logic for backtracking through the came_from dictionary is correctly defined to achieve the intended path reconstruction. Proper implementation will be essential for the functionality of the planning algorithm.
***
### FunctionDef generate_action_prompt(self, state)
**generate_action_prompt**: The function of generate_action_prompt is to generate a prompt for the LLM (Large Language Model) to decide actions based on the current state.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· state: This parameter represents the current state of the system or environment that is used to generate the action prompt.

**Code Description**: The generate_action_prompt function is designed to create a prompt that will be utilized by a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine the appropriate actions to take in a given situation. The function takes a single parameter, `state`, which encapsulates the current context or conditions that the LLM needs to consider when generating its response. 

Although the function itself currently contains a placeholder (pass statement), its intended purpose is crucial for the operation of the calling function, get_actions. The get_actions function relies on generate_action_prompt to produce a prompt that is then passed to the LLM model for action generation. Specifically, get_actions invokes generate_action_prompt with the current state, retrieves the generated prompt, and subsequently uses the LLM to generate action descriptions based on that prompt. These descriptions are then parsed into actionable items.

This relationship highlights the importance of generate_action_prompt in the overall workflow of action decision-making within the system. Without a properly implemented generate_action_prompt, the get_actions function would not be able to effectively communicate the necessary context to the LLM, potentially leading to suboptimal or irrelevant action suggestions.

**Note**: It is important to implement the generate_action_prompt function to ensure that it accurately reflects the necessary details of the state to facilitate effective action generation by the LLM. Proper handling of the state parameter is essential for the success of the action decision-making process.
***
### FunctionDef parse_actions(self, action_descriptions)
**parse_actions**: The function of parse_actions is to parse LLM output into actionable items.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· action_descriptions: This parameter represents the output generated by the LLM (Language Model), which contains descriptions of potential actions that need to be parsed into a format suitable for execution.

**Code Description**: The parse_actions function is designed to take the output from a language model, specifically the action_descriptions parameter, and convert it into actionable items. The function currently contains a placeholder (pass statement), indicating that the implementation is yet to be completed. 

This function is called within the get_actions method of the Planner class. The get_actions method is responsible for generating a prompt based on the current state and using the LLM to generate action descriptions. Once the action descriptions are obtained, they are passed to the parse_actions function for further processing. The output of parse_actions is then returned as the final list of actions that can be executed based on the LLM's suggestions.

The relationship between parse_actions and get_actions is crucial, as parse_actions serves as a processing step that transforms raw output from the LLM into a structured format that can be utilized by the rest of the application. This indicates that the functionality of parse_actions is essential for the overall action generation process within the Planner class.

**Note**: It is important to implement the logic within parse_actions to ensure that the action descriptions are correctly interpreted and converted into actionable items. Without this implementation, the get_actions method will not be able to provide meaningful actions based on the LLM's output.
