## ClassDef Manager
**Manager**: The function of Manager is to handle task management by receiving original tasks and breaking them down into sub-tasks.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· original_task: A string that stores the original task received by the Manager.  
· sub_tasks: A list that holds the sub-tasks generated from the breakdown of the original task.  
· breakdown_prompt: A template used for generating prompts related to breaking down tasks, retrieved from the environment.  
· reflection_prompt: A variable that is initialized as None, intended for future use related to task reflection.

**Code Description**: The Manager class extends the BaseAgent class, inheriting its functionalities and attributes while adding specific capabilities for task management. Upon initialization, the Manager class sets up its own attributes, including `original_task`, which is initialized as an empty string, and `sub_tasks`, which is initialized as an empty list. The `breakdown_prompt` is obtained from the environment's template system, specifically designed for breaking down tasks.

The primary method of interest in the Manager class is `receive_task`, which accepts a task as an argument and assigns it to the `original_task` attribute. This method is crucial for setting the context for subsequent operations. 

Another significant method is `breakdown_task`, which is responsible for decomposing the original task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This method calls `get_data_for_breakdown` to prepare the necessary data, which includes the original task, and then utilizes the inherited `chat` method from the BaseAgent class. The `chat` method interacts with a language model to generate a response based on the breakdown prompt and the provided data.

The `get_data_for_breakdown` method constructs a dictionary containing the `original_task`, which is then used in the `chat` method to facilitate the breakdown process. This relationship illustrates how the Manager class leverages the capabilities of the BaseAgent class to perform its task management functions effectively.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the environment is properly set up with the necessary templates for the breakdown prompt. Additionally, the interaction with the language model through the `chat` method relies on the correct implementation of the `call_llm` function, which must be defined elsewhere in the codebase.

**Output Example**: A possible output from the `breakdown_task` method might look like this:
```
{
    "response": "To complete your task, consider the following steps: Define the scope, Research relevant information, Create an outline, Draft the content.",
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Task breakdown completed successfully."
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Manager class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method that is automatically called when an instance of the Manager class is created. It begins by invoking the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization defined in the parent class is also executed. 

Following this, the function initializes several instance variables:
- `self.original_task` is set to an empty string, which is likely intended to hold the main task that the Manager will handle.
- `self.sub_tasks` is initialized as an empty list, suggesting that this Manager instance can manage multiple sub-tasks related to the original task.
- `self.breakdown_prompt` is assigned a template retrieved from the environment using `self.env.get_template('manager_break_down.txt')`. This indicates that the Manager class is likely designed to generate or manipulate prompts based on a predefined template, which could be used for task breakdowns.
- `self.reflection_prompt` is initialized to `None`, indicating that it may be set later in the code, possibly to hold a prompt related to reflection or review of tasks.

Overall, this constructor sets up the necessary attributes for the Manager class, preparing it for further operations related to task management.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parent class's constructor is called to maintain the integrity of the class hierarchy. Additionally, the template file 'manager_break_down.txt' should be present in the expected directory for the code to function correctly.

### FunctionDef receive_task(self, task)
**receive_task**: The function of receive_task is to accept and store an original task.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· task: This parameter represents the original task that is being received and stored by the function.

**Code Description**: The receive_task function is designed to accept a single parameter, which is expected to be the original task. When this function is called, it assigns the value of the task parameter to the instance variable self.original_task. This effectively stores the provided task within the instance of the class, allowing it to be accessed later as needed. The function does not perform any validation or processing on the task; it simply stores it for future use.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the task parameter passed to this function is of the expected type and format, as the function does not include any error handling or type checking. Users of this function should be aware that the stored task can be overwritten if receive_task is called multiple times with different tasks.
***
### FunctionDef breakdown_task(self)
**breakdown_task**: The function of breakdown_task is to decompose a task into subtasks.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The breakdown_task method is a member of the Manager class and is responsible for breaking down a larger task into smaller, manageable subtasks. This method first calls the get_data_for_breakdown method to retrieve the original task data, which is essential for the decomposition process. The data returned is structured as a dictionary, where the key 'task' holds the value of the original task that needs to be broken down.

Once the data is obtained, the breakdown_task method proceeds to invoke the chat method from the BaseAgent class. This method is designed to interact with a language model by generating a prompt based on the input data. In this case, the breakdown_task method passes the retrieved data and a predefined breakdown prompt to the chat method. The chat method then renders the prompt using the provided data and communicates with the language model to obtain a response, which is expected to contain the subtasks derived from the original task.

The relationship between breakdown_task and its callees is crucial for the overall functionality of task decomposition. The breakdown_task method relies on get_data_for_breakdown to ensure it has the correct context for the task at hand, and it utilizes the chat method to facilitate the interaction with the language model, effectively bridging the gap between the original task and its decomposition into subtasks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the original task is properly initialized within the Manager class before invoking breakdown_task to avoid any runtime errors. Additionally, the breakdown prompt used in the chat method should be appropriately defined to elicit meaningful responses from the language model.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the breakdown_task method could be a list of subtasks such as ["Research climate change effects", "Draft an outline for the report", "Write the introduction section"].

### FunctionDef get_data_for_breakdown(self)
**get_data_for_breakdown**: The function of get_data_for_breakdown is to retrieve the original task data for further processing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The get_data_for_breakdown method is a member of the Manager class. Its primary role is to return a dictionary containing the original task associated with the instance of the Manager class. Specifically, it constructs a dictionary with a single key-value pair, where the key is 'task' and the value is obtained from the instance variable self.original_task. 

This method is called by the breakdown_task method within the same Manager class. The breakdown_task method utilizes get_data_for_breakdown to gather the necessary data before proceeding to render a prompt for further processing. By calling get_data_for_breakdown, breakdown_task ensures that it has access to the current state of the original task, which is essential for generating meaningful sub-tasks.

The output of get_data_for_breakdown is directly integrated into the breakdown_task method, which then uses this data to create a structured prompt for a language model. This relationship highlights the importance of get_data_for_breakdown in the overall functionality of task decomposition, as it provides the foundational data needed for subsequent operations.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that self.original_task is properly initialized before invoking this method to prevent any runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the get_data_for_breakdown method could be a dictionary such as {'task': 'Write a report on climate change.'}.
