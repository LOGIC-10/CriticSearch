## ClassDef Manager
**Manager**: The function of Manager is to manage tasks by receiving an original task and breaking it down into sub-tasks for further processing.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· original_task: A string that holds the original task received by the manager.  
· sub_tasks: A list that stores the sub-tasks generated from the original task.  
· config: A configuration object that is read from a configuration file.  
· model: A string that specifies the default model to be used, defaulting to "gpt-4o-mini".  
· env: An instance of the Environment class used for loading templates from the file system.  
· sys_prompt: A string that holds the system prompt, initialized as an empty string.  
· breakdown_prompt: A template loaded from a file named 'manager_break_down.txt' used for breaking down tasks.  
· reflection_prompt: A placeholder for a reflection prompt, initialized as None.  
· repeat_turns: An integer that defines the number of times to repeat the task breakdown, defaulting to 10.

**Code Description**: The Manager class is designed to facilitate the management of tasks by allowing the user to input an original task and subsequently breaking it down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Upon initialization, the class sets up several attributes, including the original task, a list for sub-tasks, and configuration settings read from an external source. The class utilizes a templating engine to render prompts that guide the task breakdown process. 

The `__init__` method initializes the Manager instance, setting up the necessary attributes and loading the configuration settings. The `receive_task` method allows the user to input an original task, which is stored in the `original_task` attribute. The `breakdown_task` method is responsible for taking the original task and rendering a prompt using the `breakdown_prompt` template. This rendered prompt is then passed to a function called `call_llm`, which presumably interacts with a language model to generate a response based on the task breakdown.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up and that the necessary template files are available in the specified prompt folder path. The `call_llm` function must also be properly defined elsewhere in the codebase to handle the interaction with the language model.

**Output Example**: An example output from the `breakdown_task` method might look like this:
```
{
    "sub_tasks": [
        "Research the topic",
        "Draft an outline",
        "Write the introduction",
        "Gather references"
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Task has been successfully broken down."
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a new instance of the Manager class, setting up its attributes with default values and loading configuration settings.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this __init__ method.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the Manager class, which is responsible for initializing the instance attributes when a new Manager object is created. Upon instantiation, the method performs the following actions:

1. It initializes the `original_task` attribute as an empty string. This attribute is likely intended to hold the main task that the Manager will handle.
2. The `sub_tasks` attribute is initialized as an empty list, which may be used to store any sub-tasks related to the original task.
3. The `config` attribute is populated by calling the `read_config` function, which reads a configuration file and returns its contents as a dictionary. This function is defined in the agent_factory/config.py file and is crucial for loading the necessary settings for the Manager's operation.
4. The `model` attribute is set by retrieving the value associated with the key 'default_model' from the `config` dictionary. If this key does not exist, it defaults to the string "gpt-4o-mini".
5. The `env` attribute is initialized as an instance of the Environment class from the Jinja2 library, using a FileSystemLoader that points to the directory specified by the 'prompt_folder_path' key in the `config` dictionary. This setup allows the Manager to load templates for generating prompts.
6. The `sys_prompt` attribute is initialized as an empty string, which may be used to store a system prompt for the Manager's operations.
7. The `breakdown_prompt` attribute is assigned a template loaded from the file 'manager_break_down.txt' using the `env` object. This template is likely used for breaking down tasks or generating specific prompts.
8. The `reflection_prompt` attribute is initialized as None, indicating that it may be set later in the process.
9. Finally, the `repeat_turns` attribute is set to 10, which may define the number of iterations or turns the Manager will perform in certain operations.

Overall, the __init__ method establishes the foundational state of the Manager object, ensuring that all necessary attributes are initialized and that configuration settings are loaded for subsequent use. The relationship with the `read_config` function is particularly important, as it provides the configuration data that influences the behavior of the Manager.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the configuration file specified in the `read_config` function exists and is correctly formatted in YAML. Any issues with the configuration file may lead to errors during the initialization of the Manager instance.

### FunctionDef receive_task(self, task)
**receive_task**: The function of receive_task is to accept and store an original task.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· task: This parameter represents the original task that is being received and stored by the function.

**Code Description**: The receive_task function is designed to accept a single parameter, which is expected to be the original task. When this function is called, it assigns the value of the task parameter to the instance variable self.original_task. This effectively stores the provided task within the instance of the class, allowing it to be accessed later as needed. The function does not perform any validation or processing on the task; it simply stores it for future use.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the task parameter passed to this function is of the expected type and format, as the function does not include any error handling or type checking. Users of this function should be aware that the stored task can be overwritten if receive_task is called multiple times with different tasks.
***
### FunctionDef breakdown_task(self)
**breakdown_task**: The function of breakdown_task is to decompose a larger task into smaller sub-tasks.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The breakdown_task method is a member of the Manager class and is responsible for breaking down an original task into sub-tasks. It begins by creating a dictionary named `data`, which contains the key 'task' associated with the value of `self.original_task`. This dictionary is then used to render a prompt through the `self.breakdown_prompt.render(**data)` method call. The rendered prompt is a structured input that will guide the language model in generating a relevant response.

Following the prompt rendering, the method invokes the `call_llm` function, passing in several parameters: `self.model`, `self.sys_prompt`, and the `rendered_prompt`. The `call_llm` function is designed to interact with a language model API, specifically to generate a response based on the provided prompts. It initializes an OpenAI client using the model name and configuration settings, constructs a list of messages that includes both the system prompt and the user prompt, and then sends this data to the language model for processing.

The response from the `call_llm` function is captured in the variable `response_message`, which is then returned as the output of the breakdown_task method. This indicates that the breakdown_task method not only facilitates the decomposition of tasks but also serves as a bridge to the language model, allowing for intelligent processing and generation of sub-tasks based on the original task.

**Note**: Ensure that the `self.original_task` and `self.breakdown_prompt` are properly initialized before calling this method to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, be aware of the API usage limits and the potential costs associated with calling the language model API.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the breakdown_task method could be a string such as "The task can be broken down into the following sub-tasks: 1. Research the topic, 2. Draft an outline, 3. Write the introduction."
