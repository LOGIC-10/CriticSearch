## ClassDef Manager
**Manager**: The function of Manager is to manage and break down tasks into sub-tasks for further processing.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· original_task: A string that holds the original task received by the Manager.  
· sub_tasks: A list that stores the sub-tasks generated from the breakdown of the original task.  
· breakdown_prompt: A template used for generating prompts related to task breakdown, loaded from a specified template file.  
· reflection_prompt: A variable that can hold a prompt for reflection, currently initialized to None.

**Code Description**: The Manager class extends the BaseAgent class, inheriting its functionalities while adding specific capabilities for task management. Upon initialization, the Manager class calls the constructor of the BaseAgent, ensuring that all foundational attributes and methods are available. It initializes its own attributes, including `original_task`, which is set to an empty string, and `sub_tasks`, which is initialized as an empty list. The `breakdown_prompt` is loaded from a template file named 'manager_break_down.txt' using the environment object from the BaseAgent class, allowing for dynamic prompt generation based on the original task.

The primary method of the Manager class is `breakdown_task`, which is responsible for decomposing the original task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This method first retrieves the necessary data for breakdown by calling `get_data_for_breakdown`, which constructs a dictionary containing the `original_task`. The method then utilizes the `chat` method inherited from BaseAgent, passing the data and the `breakdown_prompt` to generate a response that outlines the sub-tasks.

The `get_data_for_breakdown` method serves as a utility function that prepares the data structure required for the breakdown process. It returns a dictionary with the key 'task' mapped to the `original_task`, ensuring that the prompt can be rendered with the correct context.

In summary, the Manager class leverages the capabilities of the BaseAgent class to facilitate task management, specifically focusing on breaking down complex tasks into simpler components that can be handled more effectively.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the template file 'manager_break_down.txt' is correctly formatted and accessible within the specified prompt folder path. The interaction with the language model through the `chat` method relies on the proper implementation of the `call_llm` function, which must be defined in the BaseAgent class or elsewhere in the codebase.

**Output Example**: A possible output from the `breakdown_task` method might look like this:
```
{
    "sub_tasks": [
        "Define the main objectives of the task.",
        "Identify the resources required.",
        "Establish a timeline for completion."
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Task has been successfully broken down."
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Manager class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method that is automatically called when an instance of the Manager class is created. It begins by invoking the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization defined in the parent class is also executed. 

Following this, the function initializes several instance variables:
- `self.original_task` is set to an empty string, which is likely intended to hold the main task that the Manager will handle.
- `self.sub_tasks` is initialized as an empty list, suggesting that this Manager instance can manage multiple sub-tasks related to the original task.
- `self.breakdown_prompt` is assigned a template retrieved from the environment using `self.env.get_template('manager_break_down.txt')`. This indicates that the Manager class is likely designed to generate or manipulate prompts based on a predefined template, which could be used for task breakdowns.
- `self.reflection_prompt` is initialized to `None`, indicating that it may be set later in the code, possibly to hold a prompt related to reflection or review of tasks.

Overall, this constructor sets up the necessary attributes for the Manager class, preparing it for further operations related to task management.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parent class's constructor is called to maintain the integrity of the class hierarchy. Additionally, the template file 'manager_break_down.txt' should be present in the expected directory for the code to function correctly.

### FunctionDef breakdown_task(self)
**breakdown_task**: The function of breakdown_task is to decompose a task into subtasks.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The breakdown_task method is a member of the Manager class and is responsible for breaking down a larger task into smaller, manageable subtasks. This method first calls the get_data_for_breakdown method to retrieve the original task data, which is essential for the decomposition process. The data returned is structured as a dictionary, where the key 'task' holds the value of the original task that needs to be broken down.

Once the data is obtained, the breakdown_task method proceeds to invoke the chat method from the BaseAgent class. This method is designed to interact with a language model by generating a prompt based on the input data. In this case, the breakdown_task method passes the retrieved data and a predefined breakdown prompt to the chat method. The chat method then renders the prompt using the provided data and communicates with the language model to obtain a response, which is expected to contain the subtasks derived from the original task.

The relationship between breakdown_task and its callees is crucial for the overall functionality of task decomposition. The breakdown_task method relies on get_data_for_breakdown to ensure it has the correct context for the task at hand, and it utilizes the chat method to facilitate the interaction with the language model, effectively bridging the gap between the original task and its decomposition into subtasks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the original task is properly initialized within the Manager class before invoking breakdown_task to avoid any runtime errors. Additionally, the breakdown prompt used in the chat method should be appropriately defined to elicit meaningful responses from the language model.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the breakdown_task method could be a list of subtasks such as ["Research climate change effects", "Draft an outline for the report", "Write the introduction section"].

### FunctionDef get_data_for_breakdown(self)
**get_data_for_breakdown**: The function of get_data_for_breakdown is to retrieve the original task data for further processing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The get_data_for_breakdown method is a member of the Manager class. Its primary role is to return a dictionary containing the original task associated with the instance of the Manager class. Specifically, it constructs a dictionary with a single key-value pair, where the key is 'task' and the value is obtained from the instance variable self.original_task. 

This method is called by the breakdown_task method within the same Manager class. The breakdown_task method utilizes get_data_for_breakdown to gather the necessary data before proceeding to render a prompt for further processing. By calling get_data_for_breakdown, breakdown_task ensures that it has access to the current state of the original task, which is essential for generating meaningful sub-tasks.

The output of get_data_for_breakdown is directly integrated into the breakdown_task method, which then uses this data to create a structured prompt for a language model. This relationship highlights the importance of get_data_for_breakdown in the overall functionality of task decomposition, as it provides the foundational data needed for subsequent operations.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that self.original_task is properly initialized before invoking this method to prevent any runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the get_data_for_breakdown method could be a dictionary such as {'task': 'Write a report on climate change.'}.
