## FunctionDef filter_node(node)
**filter_node**: The function of filter_node is to recursively filter a data structure, removing any dictionary entries that contain an 'id' with the letter "s" in it.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· node: The input data structure, which can be a dictionary, list, or any other data type.

**Code Description**: The filter_node function processes a given input, which can be a dictionary, list, or other data types. If the input is a dictionary, the function checks for the presence of an 'id' key. If the value associated with 'id' contains the letter "s" (case insensitive), the function returns None, effectively filtering out that dictionary. If the dictionary does not contain an 'id' with "s", the function iterates through its items, recursively calling filter_node on each value. It constructs a new dictionary containing only the filtered values.

If the input is a list, the function iterates through each item, applying the same filtering logic. Any item that results in None is excluded from the new list. For any other data type that is not a dictionary or list, the function simply returns the input unchanged.

This function is called within the extractDirectoryTree function, which reads a JSON file and loads it into a data structure. After loading the data, extractDirectoryTree calls filter_node to filter the JSON tree based on the 'id' values. The filtered data is then used to build a tree structure that contains only the relevant layers and titles. This ensures that the final output is a clean and valid JSON structure, free from any unwanted entries.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input to filter_node is either a dictionary or a list for the function to operate correctly. Any other data types will be returned as-is without modification.

**Output Example**: Given an input of the following structure:
{
    "id": "example1",
    "title": "Sample Title",
    "children": [
        {
            "id": "sample2",
            "title": "Child Title"
        },
        {
            "id": "example3",
            "title": "Another Child"
        }
    ]
}
The output after applying filter_node would be:
{
    "id": "example1",
    "title": "Sample Title",
    "children": [
        {
            "id": "example3",
            "title": "Another Child"
        }
    ]
}
## FunctionDef build_tree(node)
**build_tree**: The function of build_tree is to recursively construct a tree-like structure from a given input, preserving only the "title" of each node and its optional "children."

**parameters**:
· node: The input node which can either be a dictionary, a list, or a nested structure containing nodes that are to be processed.

**Code Description**:  
The `build_tree` function is a recursive function designed to process a hierarchical structure (usually a nested combination of dictionaries and lists) and build a simplified tree. The tree is structured to retain only the "title" field of each node and optionally include "children" if present.

- If the input `node` is a dictionary, the function checks if the dictionary contains a "title" field. If it does, a new node is created with the "title" field. If the dictionary also contains a "content" field that is a list, the function iterates through the items in the "content" list, recursively calling `build_tree` on each item. If a child node returns a non-None value, it is added as a child to the current node. If there are child nodes, they are included under the "children" key.
- If the input `node` is a dictionary without a "title" field but containing a "content" field, the function will recursively process the "content" list and return the constructed children under the "children" key.
- If the input `node` is a list, the function processes each element of the list, recursively calling `build_tree` on each item. The resulting valid child trees are collected and returned as a list. If no valid child trees are found, the function returns `None`.
- In cases where the input is neither a dictionary nor a list, the function will return `None`.

This function is mainly used to extract the hierarchical structure from more complex JSON data, ensuring that only the "title" and the "children" (if applicable) are preserved in the final output.

The `build_tree` function is called by the `extractDirectoryTree` function in the project. Specifically, `extractDirectoryTree` reads the original JSON data, filters it, and then passes the filtered data to `build_tree` to simplify the structure. After constructing the tree, it is validated to ensure the result is valid JSON before returning the final tree.

**Note**: The function relies on the presence of the "title" and "content" fields in the dictionary nodes to construct the tree. It assumes that any node with a "title" and optionally a "content" list should be processed. It does not process other fields, so any additional data in the input nodes will be discarded.

**Output Example**:  
Given an input like this:
```json
{
  "title": "Root",
  "content": [
    {
      "title": "Child 1",
      "content": [
        {"title": "Subchild 1.1"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Child 2"
    }
  ]
}
```

The output will look like:
```json
{
  "title": "Root",
  "children": [
    {
      "title": "Child 1",
      "children": [
        {"title": "Subchild 1.1"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Child 2"
    }
  ]
}
```
## FunctionDef build_markdown(node, level)
**build_markdown**: The function of build_markdown is to recursively construct a markdown text representation from a given JSON structure, focusing on titles and sentence texts while ignoring references.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: node - This is the JSON object or list that contains the data to be converted into markdown format. It can be a dictionary representing a node in the JSON structure or a list of such nodes.
· parameter2: level - This is an integer that indicates the current depth level in the JSON hierarchy. It is used to determine the number of hash symbols (#) to prepend to the title for proper markdown formatting. The default value is 1.

**Code Description**: The build_markdown function processes a JSON-like structure to generate a markdown string. It starts by initializing an empty string `md`. If the input `node` is a dictionary, the function checks for the presence of a "title" key. If found, it appends the title to the markdown string, prefixed by a number of hash symbols corresponding to the current level. Next, it looks for a "sentences" key, which should contain a list of sentence objects. For each sentence, if it has a "text" key, the text is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and added to the markdown string. 

If the node contains a "content" key, which is expected to be a list of child nodes, the function recursively calls itself for each child, increasing the level by one to reflect the deeper hierarchy. If the input node is a list, the function iterates through each item, calling itself with the same level to ensure consistent markdown formatting.

This function is called by the extractMarkdownContent function, which reads a JSON file and loads its content into a Python dictionary. It then invokes build_markdown with this data to convert it into markdown text, which is returned instead of being saved to a file. This relationship highlights the utility of build_markdown as a helper function that transforms structured data into a human-readable format.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input JSON structure adheres to the expected format, particularly the presence of "title" and "sentences" keys, to avoid unexpected results or errors.

**Output Example**: Given a JSON input like the following:
```json
{
    "title": "Sample Title",
    "sentences": [
        {"text": "This is the first sentence."},
        {"text": "This is the second sentence."}
    ],
    "content": [
        {
            "title": "Subsection Title",
            "sentences": [
                {"text": "This is a sentence in a subsection."}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
The output of the build_markdown function would be:
```
# Sample Title

This is the first sentence.

This is the second sentence.

## Subsection Title

This is a sentence in a subsection.
```
## FunctionDef extractDirectoryTree(input_file_path)
**extractDirectoryTree**: The function of extractDirectoryTree is to process a JSON file, filter its data based on specific criteria, construct a tree-like structure containing only relevant information, and validate its correctness.

**parameters**:
- input_file_path: The file path to the original JSON file that is to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The `extractDirectoryTree` function is designed to process and structure data from a JSON file into a clean, hierarchical tree. The function performs the following steps:

1. **Reading the Input File**: The function begins by opening and reading the provided JSON file (`input_file_path`). The contents of the file are loaded into a variable called `data` using the `json.load()` function, which converts the JSON text into a Python data structure (e.g., dictionaries, lists).

2. **Filtering the Data**: The loaded `data` is passed to the `filter_node` function. This function recursively filters the input data, removing any dictionary entries that contain an 'id' field with the letter "s" in it. This ensures that only relevant nodes are retained, based on the 'id' values. The output of this step is stored in the `filtered_data` variable.

3. **Building the Tree Structure**: The filtered data is then passed to the `build_tree` function. This function processes the data to create a tree-like structure, where each node in the tree contains only the "title" field and, if applicable, its "children". The `build_tree` function recursively constructs this simplified structure, preserving the hierarchy of nodes and ensuring that only the essential information (titles and children) is retained. The output of this step is stored in the `tree_structure` variable.

4. **Validating the JSON Structure**: The constructed tree is then serialized into a JSON string using `json.dumps()`. This is followed by an attempt to deserialize it back using `json.loads()`. This validation ensures that the resulting structure is a valid JSON object. If an error occurs during this process, a `ValueError` is raised with a detailed error message indicating that the JSON structure is invalid.

5. **Returning the Validated Tree**: If the tree structure is valid, it is returned as the output of the function. The return value is a clean and well-structured JSON object containing the relevant hierarchy, which is ready for further use or processing.

In the context of the project, the `extractDirectoryTree` function is called within the `__init__` method of the `ReportBenchmark` class in the `report_benchmark.py` file. The `ReportBenchmark` class utilizes `extractDirectoryTree` to extract a breadth ground truth from a JSON file, which is then used to generate a report. The result from `extractDirectoryTree` is stored in the `breadth_gt` variable and used in subsequent processing steps to create a comprehensive report.

**Note**: It is important that the input JSON file is properly formatted and contains the necessary fields, such as "id" and "title", for the `filter_node` and `build_tree` functions to work as expected. Any inconsistencies in the data could lead to errors or incomplete processing.

**Output Example**: 
Given an input JSON like:

```json
{
  "id": "example1",
  "title": "Root Title",
  "content": [
    {
      "id": "example2",
      "title": "Child 1 Title",
      "content": [
        {
          "id": "example3",
          "title": "Subchild 1 Title"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "example4",
      "title": "Child 2 Title"
    }
  ]
}
```

After processing through `extractDirectoryTree`, the output might look like:

```json
{
  "title": "Root Title",
  "children": [
    {
      "title": "Child 1 Title",
      "children": [
        {
          "title": "Subchild 1 Title"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Child 2 Title"
    }
  ]
}
```
## FunctionDef extractMarkdownContent(input_file_path)
**extractMarkdownContent**: The function of extractMarkdownContent is to read a JSON file, convert its content into a markdown text representation, and return the result.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: input_file_path - A string representing the path to the input JSON file.

**Code Description**: 
The extractMarkdownContent function is responsible for reading the contents of a given JSON file and converting it into a markdown text format. The function operates in two key stages:

1. **Reading the JSON File**: The function first opens the file specified by the `input_file_path` parameter. Using Python’s `json` module, it loads the content of the file into a dictionary. This dictionary is assumed to follow a structure that is compatible with markdown generation, particularly containing keys like "title", "sentences", and "content".

2. **Generating the Markdown**: After loading the JSON data, the function calls the `build_markdown` helper function to generate the markdown text. This function recursively processes the JSON structure, focusing on titles and sentence texts while ignoring any references. It starts by processing the top-level data and works through nested content as needed. The resulting markdown text is returned as the output.

The `build_markdown` function, which is invoked within extractMarkdownContent, processes the JSON data to produce the markdown text. This function expects the input data to have specific keys ("title", "sentences", and "content") and handles them accordingly by formatting titles with appropriate markdown headers and including sentence text as paragraph content.

**Note**: 
- The input JSON file must adhere to the expected structure, with keys like "title", "sentences", and "content" present for the function to perform correctly.
- The output will be a markdown text representation of the data in the JSON file, not a saved file.

**Output Example**:
Given the following JSON structure:
```json
{
    "title": "Sample Title",
    "sentences": [
        {"text": "This is the first sentence."},
        {"text": "This is the second sentence."}
    ],
    "content": [
        {
            "title": "Subsection Title",
            "sentences": [
                {"text": "This is a sentence in a subsection."}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The resulting markdown text will be:
```
# Sample Title

This is the first sentence.

This is the second sentence.

## Subsection Title

This is a sentence in a subsection.
```
## FunctionDef extract_markdown_sections(md_text)
**extract_markdown_sections**: The function of extract_markdown_sections is to extract sections from a given markdown text based on header lines.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· md_text: A string containing the markdown text from which sections will be extracted.

**Code Description**: The extract_markdown_sections function processes a string of markdown text to identify and separate sections based on header lines, which are indicated by lines starting with the "#" character. The function initializes an empty list called sections to hold the extracted sections and another list called current_section to accumulate lines of the current section being processed.

The function iterates through each line of the input markdown text. When it encounters a line that starts with "#", it checks if there are any lines accumulated in current_section. If there are, it joins those lines into a single string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and appends this string to the sections list. It then resets current_section to start accumulating lines for the new section.

After processing all lines, if there are any remaining lines in current_section, it joins them into a string and appends it to the sections list. Finally, the function returns the sections list, which contains all the extracted sections as separate strings.

This function is called within the ReportBenchmark class's __init__ method in the report_benchmark.py file. Specifically, it is used to process the content of a markdown file that is extracted using the extractMarkdownContent function. The resulting sections are stored in the sections attribute of the ReportBenchmark instance, which can then be utilized for generating reports or further analysis.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input markdown text is well-formed, with headers properly defined, to achieve accurate section extraction.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from the extract_markdown_sections function might look like this when provided with a markdown text containing multiple sections:

```
[
    "# Section 1\nContent of section 1.",
    "# Section 2\nContent of section 2.",
    "# Section 3\nContent of section 3."
]
```
