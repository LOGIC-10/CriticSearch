## ClassDef CriticAgent
**CriticAgent**: The function of CriticAgent is to generate critiques of responses provided by an intelligent agent, facilitating the refinement of those responses based on feedback.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
路 original_task: A string that holds the original task or question received from the user.  
路 critic_prompt: A string that contains the template for generating critiques, loaded from an external file.

**Code Description**: The CriticAgent class extends the BaseAgent class and is specifically designed to evaluate and critique the responses generated by intelligent agents. Upon initialization, it sets up two key attributes: `original_task`, which is initialized as an empty string, and `critic_prompt`, which loads a template from a file named "critic_agent.txt". This template is used to format the critiques generated by the agent.

The primary method of the CriticAgent is `critic()`, which is responsible for generating critiques. This method first retrieves data necessary for the critique by calling `get_data_for_critic()`, which compiles the `original_task` and the `agent_answer` into a dictionary. It then renders the `critic_prompt` template with this data to create a formatted prompt for the critique. The rendered prompt is sent to a chat method, which interacts with a language model to obtain a response.

The method also includes error handling for YAML parsing. If the response from the model is not valid YAML, an exception is caught, and an error message is printed, returning `None` to indicate failure in generating a valid critique.

The `receive_agent_answer(agent_answer)` method allows the CriticAgent to store the answer provided by the intelligent agent for later evaluation. The `get_data_for_critic()` method constructs a dictionary containing the original task and the agent's answer, which is essential for generating contextually relevant critiques.

The CriticAgent is utilized within the main function of the project, where it receives the user's task and the agent's answer. After the agent generates a response, the CriticAgent evaluates this response and provides feedback, which can lead to further iterations of response refinement. This feedback loop is crucial for improving the quality of the agent's answers based on real-time critiques.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `critic_prompt` template is correctly formatted and accessible, as it directly influences the quality of the critiques generated. Proper handling of YAML responses is also essential to avoid runtime errors during critique generation.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value when executing the critique might look like this:
```yaml
Critique:
  feedback: "The response lacks detail regarding the historical context."
  suggestions:
    - "Include specific examples to support the claims."
    - "Consider addressing potential counterarguments."
  Stop: false
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the `CriticAgent` class by calling the parent class's constructor and setting up the initial values for the object's attributes.

**parameters**: The __init__ method does not take any additional parameters besides `self`, which refers to the instance of the class being created.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method is the constructor for the `CriticAgent` class. It first invokes the constructor of its parent class, `BaseAgent`, using the `super().__init__()` call. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, allowing the `CriticAgent` class to inherit and initialize any attributes or methods defined in `BaseAgent`.

After calling the parent constructor, the method initializes two attributes specific to the `CriticAgent` class:
1. `self.original_task`: This attribute is set to an empty string. It is likely intended to hold information about the original task associated with the `CriticAgent`, although its exact usage is not defined within this method.
   
2. `self.critic_prompt`: This attribute is set by calling the `load_template` method with the argument `"critic_agent.txt"`. The `load_template` method, which is inherited from the `BaseAgent` class, loads the content of a template file named "critic_agent.txt" from a specified directory (likely defined in the parent class). This template content is then assigned to the `critic_prompt` attribute, which would presumably be used later in the `CriticAgent` for processing tasks related to the critic agent's functionality.

The `__init__` method ensures that when an instance of `CriticAgent` is created, the necessary setup for its attributes is completed, and the class is ready for further operations.

**Note**: The `load_template` method is responsible for handling the file reading operation. If the file `critic_agent.txt` is missing or cannot be found in the specified prompts directory, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError`, ensuring that users are informed of any missing template files.

### FunctionDef critic(self)
**critic**: The function of critic is to generate a critique based on the user's question and the agent's answer.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 None

**Code Description**: The critic function is a method within the CriticAgent class that is responsible for generating a critique of the agent's response to a user's question. The function begins by calling the get_data_for_critic method, which retrieves the necessary data for generating the critique. This data is structured as a dictionary containing the user's question and the agent's answer.

Next, the function uses the render_template method to create a prompt for the model by incorporating the retrieved data into a predefined template (critic_prompt). This rendered prompt is then sent to the chat method, which facilitates a conversation with a conversational model, specifically designed to generate critiques.

Upon receiving the model's response, the function attempts to extract and validate any YAML content present in the response using the extract_and_validate_yaml method. This method utilizes regular expressions to identify YAML content enclosed within specific delimiters and parses it into a structured format. If the parsing is successful, the formatted YAML is returned as the output of the critic function.

In the event of a parsing error, the function catches the yaml.YAMLError exception and logs an error message using the print_exception method from the RichPrinter class. This ensures that any issues encountered during the critique generation process are communicated clearly, allowing for prompt resolution.

The critic function is invoked within the main function of the project, where it plays a crucial role in the iterative process of refining the agent's responses. After the agent generates an answer to the user's question, the critique is obtained through the critic function, which evaluates the quality of the response and provides suggestions for improvement. This feedback loop is essential for enhancing the overall performance and accuracy of the intelligent agent.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the critic_prompt is properly defined and that the data returned by get_data_for_critic is accurate. Any issues with the model's response or the YAML extraction process may result in the function returning None, which could disrupt the expected flow of the application.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the critic function could be a YAML formatted string such as:

```yaml
feedback: "The agent's answer is comprehensive but lacks specific examples."
suggestions:
  - "Include more detailed explanations."
  - "Provide references to support claims."
```

### FunctionDef receive_agent_answer(self, agent_answer)
**receive_agent_answer**: The function of receive_agent_answer is to store the response received from an agent for further processing or evaluation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 agent_answer: The response provided by the agent, which is intended to be stored for subsequent use.

**Code Description**: The receive_agent_answer function is a straightforward method within the CriticAgent class. Its primary role is to accept an input parameter, agent_answer, which represents the response generated by an intelligent agent during a conversation or task execution. Upon invocation, the function assigns the value of agent_answer to the instance variable self.agent_answer. This action effectively stores the agent's response within the CriticAgent instance, allowing it to be accessed later for evaluation or critique.

This function is called within the main function of the project, specifically in the src/criticsearch/main_old_paralell.py and src/criticsearch/main_old_version.py files. In these contexts, the CriticAgent is instantiated to assess the quality of responses generated by the common agent. After the common agent produces an answer to the user's task, the receive_agent_answer function is invoked to capture this answer. The CriticAgent then processes the stored response to provide feedback, which may influence subsequent iterations of the conversation process.

The relationship between receive_agent_answer and its callers is crucial for the iterative improvement of the agent's responses. By storing the agent's answers, the CriticAgent can evaluate them against user expectations or predefined criteria, thereby facilitating a feedback loop that enhances the overall performance of the intelligent agent.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the agent_answer parameter is well-formed and relevant to the context of the conversation, as this will directly impact the effectiveness of the critique and subsequent iterations of response generation.

### FunctionDef get_data_for_critic(self)
**get_data_for_critic**: The function of get_data_for_critic is to return a dictionary containing the user's question and the agent's answer.

**parameters**: This function does not accept any parameters.

**Code Description**:  
The `get_data_for_critic` function is a method of a class, which retrieves specific data related to the user's original task and the agent's response. It returns a dictionary with two key-value pairs: the first key is `"user_question"`, which corresponds to the `original_task` attribute of the class, and the second key is `"agent_answer"`, which corresponds to the `agent_answer` attribute of the class. This method is designed to package these two pieces of information into a format suitable for further processing or analysis.

This function is invoked by the `critic` method within the same class. The `critic` method uses the data returned by `get_data_for_critic` to render a prompt for a model, which is then used to generate a response. The data returned by `get_data_for_critic` is passed to a template-rendering function (`render_template`), where it is incorporated into a template prompt. The rendered prompt is subsequently sent to a model via the `common_chat` method, and the result is further processed. The `get_data_for_critic` function thus plays a key role in providing necessary input data for the comment generation process within the `critic` method.

**Note**: This method relies on the class having attributes `original_task` and `agent_answer` set properly, as these are used to populate the returned dictionary. If either of these attributes is not initialized or is set to `None`, the function will return a dictionary with missing or invalid values.

**Output Example**:  
An example output from `get_data_for_critic` could look as follows:

```json
{
  "user_question": "What are the benefits of using AI in healthcare?",
  "agent_answer": "AI in healthcare can help with diagnostics, treatment plans, and personalized medicine."
}
```
