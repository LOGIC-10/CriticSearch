## ClassDef CriticAgent
**CriticAgent**: The function of CriticAgent is to generate critiques of responses based on user input and agent answers.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· original_task: A string that holds the original task or question received from the user.  
· critic_prompt: A string that contains the loaded template for generating critiques, sourced from a file named "critic_agent.txt".  
· agent_answer: A string that stores the answer provided by the agent, which will be critiqued.

**Code Description**: The CriticAgent class extends the BaseAgent class, inheriting its functionalities while focusing specifically on the critique generation aspect of the agent's operations. Upon initialization, the CriticAgent sets up its environment by calling the constructor of the BaseAgent class through `super().__init__()`. It initializes the `original_task` attribute to an empty string and loads the critique template from the specified file, which will be used to format the critique responses.

The main functionality of the CriticAgent is encapsulated in the `critic` method. This method is responsible for generating critiques based on the agent's answer to the original task. It first retrieves the necessary data for critique generation by calling the `get_data_for_critic` method, which compiles the `original_task` and `agent_answer` into a dictionary. The method then renders the critique prompt using the `render_template` method, passing in the data retrieved. The rendered prompt is sent to the language model via the `common_chat` method, which handles the interaction with the model.

The response from the model is expected to be in YAML format, which is validated and extracted using the `extract_and_validate_yaml` method. If the response contains valid YAML, it is returned; otherwise, an error message is printed, and the method returns None.

The CriticAgent also includes the `receive_agent_answer` method, which allows it to store the agent's answer for later critique. The `get_data_for_critic` method is a helper function that prepares the data needed for generating critiques by returning a dictionary containing the `original_task` and `agent_answer`.

The CriticAgent is utilized within the broader context of the project, specifically in the `process_single_task` function and the main execution flow of the application. It receives the original task and the agent's answer, critiques the response, and provides feedback that can be used to refine the agent's output. This interaction is crucial for improving the quality of the responses generated by the agent, as it allows for iterative refinement based on critiques.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the template file "critic_agent.txt" is correctly formatted and accessible, as the CriticAgent relies on this template for generating critiques. Additionally, the agent's answer must be provided before calling the `critic` method to ensure that the critique is based on the most recent response.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value when generating a critique might look like this:
```yaml
critique:
  feedback: "The response lacks depth and does not address the user's question adequately."
  suggestions:
    - "Provide more detailed explanations."
    - "Include relevant examples to support the claims."
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the `CriticAgent` class by calling the parent class's constructor and setting up the initial values for the object's attributes.

**parameters**: The __init__ method does not take any additional parameters besides `self`, which refers to the instance of the class being created.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method is the constructor for the `CriticAgent` class. It first invokes the constructor of its parent class, `BaseAgent`, using the `super().__init__()` call. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, allowing the `CriticAgent` class to inherit and initialize any attributes or methods defined in `BaseAgent`.

After calling the parent constructor, the method initializes two attributes specific to the `CriticAgent` class:
1. `self.original_task`: This attribute is set to an empty string. It is likely intended to hold information about the original task associated with the `CriticAgent`, although its exact usage is not defined within this method.
   
2. `self.critic_prompt`: This attribute is set by calling the `load_template` method with the argument `"critic_agent.txt"`. The `load_template` method, which is inherited from the `BaseAgent` class, loads the content of a template file named "critic_agent.txt" from a specified directory (likely defined in the parent class). This template content is then assigned to the `critic_prompt` attribute, which would presumably be used later in the `CriticAgent` for processing tasks related to the critic agent's functionality.

The `__init__` method ensures that when an instance of `CriticAgent` is created, the necessary setup for its attributes is completed, and the class is ready for further operations.

**Note**: The `load_template` method is responsible for handling the file reading operation. If the file `critic_agent.txt` is missing or cannot be found in the specified prompts directory, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError`, ensuring that users are informed of any missing template files.

### FunctionDef critic(self)
**critic**: The function of critic is to generate a critique based on the user's question and the agent's answer.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The critic function is a method within the CriticAgent class that is responsible for generating a critique of the agent's response to a user's question. It begins by retrieving relevant data through the get_data_for_critic method, which returns a dictionary containing the user's original question and the agent's answer. This data is then used to create a rendered prompt by calling the render_template method, which formats the critique prompt using the specified template and the retrieved data.

Next, the function sends the rendered prompt to a conversational model using the common_chat method. This method facilitates communication with the model, allowing it to process the prompt and generate a response. The response from the model is expected to contain YAML content, which is then extracted and validated using the extract_and_validate_yaml method. This method ensures that the YAML content is correctly formatted and can be parsed into a usable structure.

If the extraction and validation of the YAML content are successful, the function returns the formatted YAML. However, if there is an error during this process, such as invalid YAML content, the function catches the exception and logs an error message using the print_exception method from the RichPrinter class. In this case, the function returns None, indicating that the critique could not be generated due to an issue with the model's response.

The critic function is called within the main function of the project, where it is used to evaluate the agent's answer after it has been generated. The critique provided by the critic function can influence subsequent actions, such as whether to stop the iteration process or to perform additional searches based on the feedback received.

**Note**: It is essential that the model's response contains valid YAML content wrapped in the appropriate delimiters for the extract_and_validate_yaml method to function correctly. If the content is not valid, the function will return None, which may disrupt the expected flow of the application.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the critic function could be a YAML formatted string such as:

```yaml
feedback: "The agent's answer is comprehensive but lacks specific examples."
suggestions:
  - "Include more detailed explanations."
  - "Provide references to support claims."
```

### FunctionDef receive_agent_answer(self, agent_answer)
**receive_agent_answer**: The function of receive_agent_answer is to store the answer provided by an agent for further processing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· agent_answer: This parameter represents the answer received from the agent, which will be stored in the instance variable for later use.

**Code Description**: The receive_agent_answer function is a method defined within the CriticAgent class. Its primary role is to accept an answer from an agent and assign it to an instance variable named agent_answer. This allows the CriticAgent to retain the agent's response for subsequent evaluations or actions. 

This function is invoked within the process_single_task function found in the src/criticsearch/main.py file. In this context, after the common_agent generates an answer to a given task, the CriticAgent receives this answer through the receive_agent_answer method. This step is crucial as it enables the CriticAgent to assess the quality of the answer provided by the common_agent, facilitating a feedback loop where the CriticAgent can evaluate and potentially improve the response based on its own criteria.

The relationship between receive_agent_answer and its caller, process_single_task, is integral to the overall functionality of the system. The CriticAgent acts as a reviewer of the answers generated by the common_agent, and the receive_agent_answer method serves as the mechanism through which the CriticAgent acquires the necessary information to perform its evaluation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the agent_answer passed to this function is valid and relevant to the task at hand, as this will directly impact the effectiveness of the CriticAgent's evaluation process.

### FunctionDef get_data_for_critic(self)
**get_data_for_critic**: The function of get_data_for_critic is to return a dictionary containing the user's question and the agent's answer.

**parameters**: This function does not accept any parameters.

**Code Description**:  
The `get_data_for_critic` function is a method of a class, which retrieves specific data related to the user's original task and the agent's response. It returns a dictionary with two key-value pairs: the first key is `"user_question"`, which corresponds to the `original_task` attribute of the class, and the second key is `"agent_answer"`, which corresponds to the `agent_answer` attribute of the class. This method is designed to package these two pieces of information into a format suitable for further processing or analysis.

This function is invoked by the `critic` method within the same class. The `critic` method uses the data returned by `get_data_for_critic` to render a prompt for a model, which is then used to generate a response. The data returned by `get_data_for_critic` is passed to a template-rendering function (`render_template`), where it is incorporated into a template prompt. The rendered prompt is subsequently sent to a model via the `common_chat` method, and the result is further processed. The `get_data_for_critic` function thus plays a key role in providing necessary input data for the comment generation process within the `critic` method.

**Note**: This method relies on the class having attributes `original_task` and `agent_answer` set properly, as these are used to populate the returned dictionary. If either of these attributes is not initialized or is set to `None`, the function will return a dictionary with missing or invalid values.

**Output Example**:  
An example output from `get_data_for_critic` could look as follows:

```json
{
  "user_question": "What are the benefits of using AI in healthcare?",
  "agent_answer": "AI in healthcare can help with diagnostics, treatment plans, and personalized medicine."
}
```
