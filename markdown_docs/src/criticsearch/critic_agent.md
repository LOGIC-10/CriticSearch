## ClassDef CriticAgent
**CriticAgent**: The function of CriticAgent is to generate critiques based on the responses provided by an intelligent agent.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
路 original_task: A string that holds the original task or question received from the user.  
路 critic_prompt: A string that contains the template for generating critiques, loaded from a specified template file.

**Code Description**: The CriticAgent class extends the BaseAgent class, inheriting its foundational capabilities while specializing in the evaluation of responses generated by other agents. Upon initialization, the CriticAgent sets up its original task as an empty string and loads a critique template from a file named "critic_agent.txt". 

The primary method of the CriticAgent is `critic`, which is responsible for generating critiques. This method first gathers the necessary data for critique generation by calling `get_data_for_critic`, which compiles the original task and the agent's answer into a dictionary. The `critic` method then renders the critique prompt using this data and interacts with a common chat interface to obtain a response from the model. 

The response is expected to be in YAML format, which is validated and extracted using the `extract_and_validate_yaml` method. If the response contains invalid YAML, an error message is printed, and the method returns None. 

Additionally, the CriticAgent has a method called `receive_agent_answer`, which allows it to store the answer provided by the agent for later critique. The `get_data_for_critic` method is a helper function that prepares the data needed for the critique by returning a dictionary containing the original task and the agent's answer.

The CriticAgent is utilized within the main function of the project, where it receives the task and the agent's answer, generates a critique, and evaluates whether to continue the interaction based on the critique's content. This interaction is part of a loop that allows for iterative refinement of the agent's responses based on feedback from the CriticAgent.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the template file "critic_agent.txt" is correctly formatted and accessible, as the CriticAgent relies on this template to generate critiques. Additionally, proper handling of YAML responses is crucial to avoid runtime errors during critique validation.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value when generating a critique might look like this:
```yaml
Critique:
  feedback: "The answer provided lacks depth and does not address the user's question adequately."
  suggestions:
    - "Include more detailed examples."
    - "Clarify the main points."
  Stop: false
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the `CriticAgent` class by calling the parent class's constructor and setting up the initial values for the object's attributes.

**parameters**: The __init__ method does not take any additional parameters besides `self`, which refers to the instance of the class being created.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method is the constructor for the `CriticAgent` class. It first invokes the constructor of its parent class, `BaseAgent`, using the `super().__init__()` call. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, allowing the `CriticAgent` class to inherit and initialize any attributes or methods defined in `BaseAgent`.

After calling the parent constructor, the method initializes two attributes specific to the `CriticAgent` class:
1. `self.original_task`: This attribute is set to an empty string. It is likely intended to hold information about the original task associated with the `CriticAgent`, although its exact usage is not defined within this method.
   
2. `self.critic_prompt`: This attribute is set by calling the `load_template` method with the argument `"critic_agent.txt"`. The `load_template` method, which is inherited from the `BaseAgent` class, loads the content of a template file named "critic_agent.txt" from a specified directory (likely defined in the parent class). This template content is then assigned to the `critic_prompt` attribute, which would presumably be used later in the `CriticAgent` for processing tasks related to the critic agent's functionality.

The `__init__` method ensures that when an instance of `CriticAgent` is created, the necessary setup for its attributes is completed, and the class is ready for further operations.

**Note**: The `load_template` method is responsible for handling the file reading operation. If the file `critic_agent.txt` is missing or cannot be found in the specified prompts directory, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError`, ensuring that users are informed of any missing template files.

### FunctionDef critic(self)
**critic**: The function of critic is to generate a review based on user input and agent responses.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 None

**Code Description**: The critic function is a method within the CriticAgent class that is responsible for generating a review or critique based on the data it retrieves and processes. The function operates as follows:

1. **Data Retrieval**: It begins by calling the `get_data_for_critic` method, which returns a dictionary containing the user's question and the agent's answer. This data is essential for generating a contextually relevant critique.

2. **Template Rendering**: The function then utilizes the `render_template` method to create a prompt for the model. This method takes the `critic_prompt` (a predefined template) and the data retrieved in the previous step, formatting it into a string that can be understood by the model.

3. **Model Interaction**: The rendered prompt is sent to the `common_chat` method, which facilitates a conversation with the model. This method processes the user prompt and returns a response from the model, which is expected to contain the critique or review.

4. **YAML Extraction and Validation**: After receiving the model's response, the function attempts to extract and validate any YAML content using the `extract_and_validate_yaml` method. This method checks for valid YAML formatting and returns the parsed content if successful.

5. **Error Handling**: If the YAML extraction fails (for instance, if the content is not valid YAML), the function catches the `yaml.YAMLError` exception, prints an error message indicating the issue, and returns `None`.

The critic function is invoked within the `main` function of the project, specifically after the common agent has provided an answer to the user's question. The response from the critic function is then used to evaluate the agent's answer, potentially influencing subsequent iterations of the conversation. This highlights the function's role in providing feedback and improving the overall interaction quality between the user and the agent.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the `critic_prompt` is properly defined and that the data returned by `get_data_for_critic` is valid. If the model response does not contain valid YAML, the function will return `None`, which may affect the flow of the application.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the critic function could be a YAML formatted string such as:

```yaml
feedback: "The agent's answer is comprehensive but lacks specific examples."
suggestions:
  - "Include more detailed explanations."
  - "Provide references to support claims."
```

### FunctionDef receive_agent_answer(self, agent_answer)
**receive_agent_answer**: The function of receive_agent_answer is to store the answer provided by an agent for further processing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 agent_answer: This parameter represents the answer received from the agent, which will be stored in the instance variable.

**Code Description**: The receive_agent_answer function is a method of the CriticAgent class. Its primary role is to accept an answer from an agent and assign it to the instance variable self.agent_answer. This function is crucial in the context of the CriticAgent's operations, as it allows the agent to receive and retain feedback or responses from other agents involved in the conversation or task execution.

In the broader context of the project, this function is called within the main function located in src/criticsearch/main.py. During the execution of the main function, after the common agent generates an answer to a user question, the CriticAgent is instantiated. The receive_agent_answer method is then invoked with the common agent's answer as an argument. This step is essential for the CriticAgent to evaluate the quality of the answer provided by the common agent. The stored answer can later be used for further analysis or feedback generation, which is part of the CriticAgent's role in the overall system.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the agent_answer parameter passed to this function is valid and represents a meaningful response from the agent to avoid any issues in subsequent evaluations or processing.
***
### FunctionDef get_data_for_critic(self)
**get_data_for_critic**: The function of get_data_for_critic is to return a dictionary containing the user's question and the agent's answer.

**parameters**: This function does not accept any parameters.

**Code Description**:  
The `get_data_for_critic` function is a method of a class, which retrieves specific data related to the user's original task and the agent's response. It returns a dictionary with two key-value pairs: the first key is `"user_question"`, which corresponds to the `original_task` attribute of the class, and the second key is `"agent_answer"`, which corresponds to the `agent_answer` attribute of the class. This method is designed to package these two pieces of information into a format suitable for further processing or analysis.

This function is invoked by the `critic` method within the same class. The `critic` method uses the data returned by `get_data_for_critic` to render a prompt for a model, which is then used to generate a response. The data returned by `get_data_for_critic` is passed to a template-rendering function (`render_template`), where it is incorporated into a template prompt. The rendered prompt is subsequently sent to a model via the `common_chat` method, and the result is further processed. The `get_data_for_critic` function thus plays a key role in providing necessary input data for the comment generation process within the `critic` method.

**Note**: This method relies on the class having attributes `original_task` and `agent_answer` set properly, as these are used to populate the returned dictionary. If either of these attributes is not initialized or is set to `None`, the function will return a dictionary with missing or invalid values.

**Output Example**:  
An example output from `get_data_for_critic` could look as follows:

```json
{
  "user_question": "What are the benefits of using AI in healthcare?",
  "agent_answer": "AI in healthcare can help with diagnostics, treatment plans, and personalized medicine."
}
```
