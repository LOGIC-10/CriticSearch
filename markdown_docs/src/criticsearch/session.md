## ClassDef Session
**Session**: The function of Session is to wrap the CriticSearch process according to the step interface, enabling it to be invoked within the RAGEN environment.

**Attributes**: 
- **user_prompt**: A string representing the user's input or prompt for the session. 
- **agent**: An instance of the `BaseAgent` class, which handles tasks such as receiving prompts and managing training data.
- **search_results**: A string that stores the results of an asynchronous search operation.
- **detailed_web_results**: A string that holds the detailed results obtained from web scraping.
- **agent_report**: A string that accumulates the reports generated by the agent during the session.
- **verifier**: An instance of the `ReportVerifier` class, which is used to evaluate the quality of the writing or generated content.
- **last_score**: A floating-point value representing the score of the most recent verification process.

**Code Description**: 
The `Session` class encapsulates the process of conducting a CriticSearch within the context of a stepwise interface. It is designed to facilitate interaction within the RAGEN environment by managing the flow of tasks, including search, browsing, note-taking, and writing. The class is initialized with a user prompt and subsequently creates an agent to process the prompt and handle tasks such as searching and web scraping.

- **`__init__(self, prompt: str)`**: This method initializes a new session. It accepts a user prompt, creates an agent instance, and sets up necessary data structures, such as the agent's training data and memo. The session also initializes variables for tracking the status of search results, web scraping results, agent reports, and evaluation scores.

- **`search(self, queries: list[str]) -> str`**: This method performs an asynchronous search based on a list of queries. It uses the agent's search aggregator to fetch results and stores the results in the `search_results` attribute. The method returns the search results as a string.

- **`browse(self, urls: list[str]) -> str`**: This method performs web scraping for the given list of URLs. It uses the agent's content scraper to fetch detailed web data, which is appended to the `detailed_web_results` attribute. It returns the scraped data as a string.

- **`take_notes(self, text: str) -> str`**: This method allows the agent to take notes based on the provided text. It invokes the agent’s note-taking functionality and appends the generated notes to the agent's training data. The method returns the notes as a string.

- **`start_writing(self, section: str) -> str`**: This method initiates the process of writing a section based on the previous search and browsing results. It utilizes the `_action_router` function to generate content for the section, and appends the generated content to the `agent_report`. The method also verifies the generated content using the `ReportVerifier` and stores the verification score in the `last_score` attribute. It returns the generated content as a string.

**Note**:
- The `Session` class is intended to manage the workflow of CriticSearch within the RAGEN environment and should be used in environments where such structured processes are required.
- Asynchronous operations such as search and browsing are handled using `asyncio.run()`, ensuring that the system can perform tasks concurrently.
- The agent is designed to accumulate training data, which helps refine the system's performance over time.

**Output Example**:
- After calling `search()` with a list of queries, the output might look like: `"Search results for 'data science' include: [result1, result2, result3]"`.
- After calling `browse()` with a list of URLs, the output could be: `"Detailed web scraping results: <scraped content>"`.
- Calling `take_notes()` might yield: `"Notes: Data science involves the use of algorithms to extract insights."`.
- Calling `start_writing()` could generate: `"Generated content: In the field of data science, algorithms play a crucial role..."`.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, prompt)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a Session object with a user prompt and set up the necessary components for the agent's operation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· prompt: A string that represents the user's input or question that the agent will process.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the Session class, which is responsible for initializing the session with a user-provided prompt. Upon instantiation, the method takes a single parameter, prompt, which is expected to be a string. This prompt is stored in the instance variable user_prompt, allowing the agent to understand the context of the user's request.

The method then creates an instance of the BaseAgent class, which serves as the foundational component for handling interactions and processing tasks. The agent is initialized to receive the user's prompt through the receive_task method, which stores the prompt for future reference and processing. Additionally, the training_data attribute of the agent is populated with the user's prompt, formatted as a dictionary containing the source ("human") and the value (the prompt itself). This setup is crucial for the agent's learning and response generation capabilities.

The __init__ method also initializes several attributes related to the session's state. These include search_results, detailed_web_results, and agent_report, all of which are set to empty strings initially. These attributes are intended to hold the results of the agent's operations and any reports generated during the session.

Furthermore, the method instantiates a ReportVerifier object, passing the agent as a parameter. This verifier is responsible for evaluating the accuracy of the agent's responses against factual data, ensuring that the information provided to the user is reliable and correct. The last_score attribute is initialized to 0.0, which will later be used to store the score from the verification process.

The relationship between the __init__ method and its callees is significant, as it establishes the foundational context for the agent's operations. By initializing the agent with the user's prompt and setting up the necessary components, the session is prepared to handle various tasks, including searching for information, generating responses, and verifying the accuracy of those responses.

**Note**: It is essential to provide a well-defined prompt to the Session object upon initialization. The effectiveness of the agent's responses and the accuracy of the verification process depend heavily on the quality of the input prompt. Proper initialization ensures that the agent is ready to engage with the user's request effectively.

### FunctionDef search(self, queries)
**search**: The function of search is to perform an asynchronous search based on a list of queries.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· queries: A list of strings representing the search queries to be executed.

**Code Description**: The search function is designed to execute an asynchronous search operation. It takes a single parameter, `queries`, which is expected to be a list of strings. Within the function, it utilizes the `asyncio.run()` method to run an asynchronous search operation provided by `self.agent.search_aggregator.search(queries)`. This means that the function will wait for the completion of the search operation before proceeding. The results of the search are stored in the instance variable `self.search_results`, which is then returned as the output of the function. This design allows for efficient handling of potentially time-consuming search operations without blocking the execution of other code.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `queries` parameter is a list of strings, as passing an incorrect type may lead to runtime errors. Additionally, since the function performs an asynchronous operation, it should be called in an appropriate context that supports asynchronous execution.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value could be a string containing the aggregated results of the search queries, such as "Results for query1, query2, and query3: [result1, result2, result3]".
***
### FunctionDef browse(self, urls)
**browse**: The function of browse is to execute a web scraping operation on the provided URLs and return the results.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· urls: List[str] - A list of URLs that need to be scraped for content.

**Code Description**: The `browse` function is designed to initiate a web scraping process by utilizing an asynchronous call to the `scrape` method from the `ContentScraper` class. The function takes a list of URLs as input and uses the `asyncio.run()` method to execute the `scrape` function, which is expected to return the scraped content for the provided URLs.

Once the scraping process completes, the returned content is appended to the `detailed_web_results` attribute, which stores a cumulative record of the web scraping outcomes. This cumulative result is updated by appending the newly retrieved content, ensuring that previous results are preserved for later use or further processing.

The `scrape` method itself is responsible for extracting content from the given URLs. It handles both successful and failed attempts at scraping, with fallback mechanisms in place when necessary. The function's output is directly returned after the scraping process finishes, enabling the caller to work with the content.

This method is commonly used within the broader context of the system to collect web data from multiple sources, ensuring that the relevant information is retrieved and stored for later use.

**Note**: The function expects a valid list of URLs to be provided for optimal performance. If the URLs are invalid or inaccessible, the behavior of the `scrape` method might involve retries or fallback mechanisms. The final content returned by the function can vary based on the success or failure of the scraping operation.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{
    "data": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "content": "No content available"}
    ]
}
```
***
### FunctionDef take_notes(self, text)
**take_notes**: The function of take_notes is to record notes extracted from a given text input.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· text: A string containing the text from which notes will be extracted.

**Code Description**: The take_notes function is a method within the Session class that facilitates the process of recording notes based on the input text. When invoked, it calls the taking_notes method from the agent attribute, passing the provided text as an argument. This method is responsible for extracting relevant information from the text and returning it as notes.

Once the notes are obtained, the function appends a dictionary to the agent's training_data list. This dictionary contains three key-value pairs: "from" indicating the source as "agent", "action" specifying the action taken as "TAKING_NOTES", and "action_content" which holds the actual notes extracted. This structured logging of actions is crucial for tracking the agent's activities and improving its learning process.

The take_notes function ultimately returns the notes that were recorded, providing a direct output of the operation performed. This function is integral to maintaining an updated record of information that the agent can utilize for future tasks or interactions.

The take_notes function is typically called in scenarios where the agent needs to process new information and update its knowledge base accordingly, ensuring that it remains informed and capable of responding to user queries effectively.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the text parameter is well-structured and contains relevant information for effective note extraction. The function will return the notes as a string, which should be handled appropriately by the caller.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the take_notes function could be:
```
"Extracted note 1: Important information regarding the topic. Extracted note 2: Additional insights and references."
```

### FunctionDef start_writing(self, section)
### `start_writing` Method Documentation

#### Overview
The `start_writing` method is a function within the `Session` class responsible for initiating the content generation process for a specified section of a task or document. It utilizes the `_action_router` function to guide the agent through the necessary steps to generate appropriate content for the given section, appends the generated content to the agent's report, and validates the accuracy of the generated content.

#### Parameters
- **section** (`str`): A string representing the specific section of the task or document for which the content is being generated.

#### Return Value
- **str**: The generated content for the specified section.

#### Method Description
1. **Action Routing**:
   The method begins by calling the `_action_router` function. This function orchestrates the decision-making process, utilizing the agent's state, search results, and user-provided prompt. It generates the content for the specified section based on the current context and task. The function takes several parameters including:
   - The `agent` (which is an instance of the agent handling the task),
   - `search_results` (relevant results accumulated from previous searches),
   - `user_prompt` (the prompt provided by the user for context),
   - The specific `section` for which the content is generated,
   - `iteration` (set to 0 for the first iteration),
   - `agent_report` (the agent's accumulated report so far),
   - `guide_line` (providing the necessary guidelines for the task),
   - `detailed_web_results` (optional detailed results from any web scraping).

2. **Agent Report Update**:
   Once the content is generated, it is added to the agent's report. The `agent_report` string is updated by concatenating the newly generated content.

3. **Content Verification**:
   The method then proceeds to verify the accuracy of the generated content. This is done by calling the `verify_section` method of the `ReportVerifier` class, which assesses the factual accuracy of the content. In this method, the verification is performed with an empty list (i.e., no extracted facts are provided), though this list can be populated with factual data for more thorough validation in future iterations. The result of the verification process is stored in the `last_score` variable.

4. **Returning the Generated Content**:
   Finally, the method returns the generated content for the specified section.

#### Usage Example
```python
session = Session(agent, search_results, user_prompt, agent_report, detailed_web_results)
section_content = session.start_writing("Introduction")
print(section_content)
```

#### Notes
- The method does not perform detailed fact-checking on the generated content in its current form, as the list of extracted facts is empty. This could be modified for more robust verification.
- The method relies on the `_action_router` function to perform the bulk of the decision-making and content generation process, ensuring that the agent’s actions align with the task's goals.
