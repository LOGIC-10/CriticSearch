## FunctionDef traverse(data, level)
**traverse**: The function of traverse is to recursively traverse a nested structure of dictionaries and lists and print the "title" key from any dictionary encountered.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: data (Required) – This parameter is the data structure to be traversed, which can be a dictionary, list, or any other nested combination of these types.
· parameter2: level (Optional) – An integer indicating the current level of recursion. It is used for indentation purposes to visually represent the depth of traversal.

**Code Description**: 
The traverse function is a recursive function designed to navigate through a nested data structure, which may consist of dictionaries, lists, or combinations of both. The function begins by checking the type of the `data` parameter to determine how to process it.

1. If `data` is a dictionary, it first checks if the dictionary contains a key named "title." If this key exists, its value is printed with indentation that corresponds to the current `level`. The indentation is achieved by multiplying four spaces ("    ") by the `level` parameter.
   
2. After checking for the "title" key, the function then iterates over all the key-value pairs in the dictionary. If any of the values are another dictionary or a list, the function calls itself recursively with the value and an incremented `level` (i.e., `level + 1`).

3. If `data` is a list, the function iterates over each item in the list and recursively calls itself on each item.

The recursive nature of this function allows it to handle arbitrarily nested dictionaries and lists. The indentation helps to visualize the depth of each level of recursion when printing the "title" values.

**Note**: 
- The `level` parameter is optional and defaults to 0, representing the top level of the data structure. If provided, it should be an integer.
- The function expects the input data to be a dictionary or list; other data types are not processed.
- If dictionaries or lists are nested inside each other, the function will process them in a depth-first manner, meaning it explores each item fully before moving to the next.
- The printed output will display the "title" value for each dictionary that contains it, indented according to its level in the structure.
