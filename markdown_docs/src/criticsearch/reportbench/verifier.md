## ClassDef ReportVerifier
**ReportVerifier**: The function of ReportVerifier is to verify the accuracy of extracted facts against generated answers in a factual question-answering context.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· agent: An instance of an agent responsible for interacting with templates and generating responses.
· scorer: An instance of RougeScorer used to evaluate the quality of generated answers based on ROUGE-L metrics.

**Code Description**: The ReportVerifier class is designed to facilitate the verification of factual accuracy in responses generated by an agent. It achieves this by comparing the answers produced by the agent against a set of extracted facts. The class is initialized with an agent, which is utilized to interact with templates for generating responses based on user questions.

The primary method, verify_section, takes a context string and a list of extracted facts as input. It initiates the verification process by printing the total number of questions to be verified. The method defines a nested function, verify_single_question, which processes each fact individually. This function constructs a data dictionary containing the context, user question, and expected format, and then calls the agent to generate a response using a predefined template. The generated response is subsequently checked against the expected answer using the _check_answer method.

To enhance performance, the verification of multiple questions is executed concurrently using a ThreadPoolExecutor, allowing for efficient processing of up to 20 questions simultaneously. The results of the verification are collected, and the overall accuracy is calculated using the _calculate_score method, which combines exact matches and ROUGE-L scores to produce a final accuracy metric.

The class also includes helper methods such as _normalize_text, which standardizes text by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase, and _check_answer, which evaluates the correctness of the model's answer by checking for exact matches and calculating the ROUGE-L score if necessary. The _calculate_score method aggregates the results of the verification process, providing a summary of exact matches and average ROUGE-L scores.

The ReportVerifier class is called within the process_single_task function of the main module. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy of the report generated by the agent by verifying the factual correctness of the content produced in response to user queries. This integration allows for a systematic approach to validating the information presented in the final report, enhancing the reliability of the output.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the agent is properly configured and that the extracted facts are accurately provided to the ReportVerifier for effective verification. The performance of the verification process may vary based on the complexity of the questions and the quality of the agent's responses.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the verify_section method could be a float representing the accuracy score, such as:
```
0.85  # indicating an 85% accuracy in the verification process.
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, agent)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ReportVerifier object with a given agent and configure a RougeScorer instance for evaluating text similarity.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
- agent: An object that is assigned to the `agent` attribute of the ReportVerifier class.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` function is the constructor method for the `ReportVerifier` class. When an instance of `ReportVerifier` is created, the method takes in a parameter `agent` and assigns it to the instance's `agent` attribute. This allows the `ReportVerifier` object to interact with or use the agent throughout its lifecycle.

In addition to initializing the `agent`, the method also initializes a `rouge_scorer.RougeScorer` object. The `RougeScorer` is configured to evaluate the Rouge-L metric, which is used to assess the quality of text summaries by comparing them with reference texts. The `use_stemmer=True` argument is passed to the `RougeScorer` to ensure that stemming is applied during the comparison process. Stemming reduces words to their base or root form, enhancing the robustness of the text comparison by ignoring minor variations in word forms.

**Note**: The `agent` parameter must be an object that is compatible with the functionality intended in the `ReportVerifier` class. The `RougeScorer` instance will always be configured with the Rouge-L metric and stemming enabled, which is crucial for ensuring consistent evaluation results when performing text similarity comparisons.

### FunctionDef verify_section(self, context, extracted_facts)
## Function Documentation: `verify_section`

### Description:
The `verify_section` function is responsible for verifying a series of factual questions based on a provided context and extracted facts. It evaluates the accuracy of answers for each question by comparing the response generated by an agent with the expected answer. The function utilizes parallel processing to verify multiple questions simultaneously and calculates an overall accuracy score based on the results.

### Parameters:
- **context** (str): A string representing the context in which the questions are being asked. This context is used by the agent to generate responses relevant to each question.
  
- **extracted_facts** (List[Dict]): A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a question and its associated metadata. Each dictionary must contain the following keys:
  - `"question"` (str): The question to be verified.
  - `"format"` (str): The expected format of the answer.
  - `"answer"` (str): The expected answer to the question.

### Return Value:
- **float**: The function returns a floating-point number representing the overall accuracy score of the verification process. This score is calculated by evaluating exact matches and partial matches using the ROUGE-L metric.

### Functionality:
1. **Initialization**: The function begins by printing a summary of the number of questions to be verified.
  
2. **Verification Process**:
   - A nested function `verify_single_question` is defined to verify each question individually. This function creates a `qa_data` dictionary containing the context, user question, and expected answer format.
   - For each fact in `extracted_facts`, the function invokes the agent's `chat_with_template` method, passing the `qa_data` to generate a response based on the context.
   - The agent's response is then compared with the expected answer using the `_check_answer` method to determine if the answer is correct.
   
3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - The function utilizes `ThreadPoolExecutor` to concurrently verify multiple questions, optimizing the process and reducing the overall verification time.
   - A list of future tasks is created, each representing a call to `verify_single_question`. These tasks are executed in parallel, and their results are collected as they complete.

4. **Results Compilation**:
   - After all questions have been verified, the results (whether each answer was correct or not, and the corresponding ROUGE-L score) are collected.

5. **Accuracy Calculation**:
   - The function calls the `_calculate_score` method to compute a final accuracy score based on the results of the verification. The score is calculated as a weighted average of exact matches and ROUGE-L scores.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The accuracy score is returned to indicate the overall correctness of the factual question-answer verification process.

### Example:
```python
context = "The context of the document or passage to verify."
extracted_facts = [
    {"question": "What is the capital of France?", "format": "text", "answer": "Paris"},
    {"question": "Who wrote '1984'?", "format": "text", "answer": "George Orwell"}
]
accuracy = verifier.verify_section(context, extracted_facts)
print(f"Verification Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

### Notes:
- The function is designed to handle large numbers of questions efficiently by utilizing multithreading.
- The accuracy score returned provides a combined metric of both exact matches and partial matches, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the verification process.
#### FunctionDef verify_single_question(fact)
**verify_single_question**: The function of verify_single_question is to verify a single question by interacting with a model, comparing its answer to the expected answer, and checking the accuracy.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· fact: A dictionary containing information about the question to be verified, including the question itself, the format of the question, and the expected answer.

**Code Description**: The verify_single_question function is responsible for verifying a specific question and its associated answer by interacting with a conversational model. It accepts a single parameter, fact, which is a dictionary containing key information about the question, its format, and the expected answer.

The function begins by constructing a dictionary, `qa_data`, which stores the relevant details of the question and its format. The dictionary contains the following keys:
- "context": context (assumed to be defined elsewhere in the class or script)
- "user_question": the question to be verified, which is retrieved from the fact dictionary under the key "question"
- "constrained_format": the format of the question, which is retrieved from the fact dictionary under the key "format"

Next, the function prints the question and its format to the console for logging or tracking purposes.

The function then interacts with a model by calling the `chat_with_template` method from the `self.agent` object. This method is used to communicate with the model, utilizing a specific template file, "factQA_verifier.txt". The `qa_data` dictionary is passed as input to the template, allowing the model to generate a response that is contextually relevant to the provided question and format.

After receiving the model's response, the function calls another method, `_check_answer`, to evaluate the model's answer. The response from the model is compared to the expected answer stored in the fact dictionary under the key "answer". The `_check_answer` method checks if the model's answer matches the expected answer and provides a score (typically ROUGE-L) if there is a partial match. This result is returned by the `verify_single_question` function.

The function relies on the `chat_with_template` method from the `BaseAgent` class to facilitate communication with the model, and the `_check_answer` method to determine the accuracy of the response.

**Note**: The `verify_single_question` function assumes that the necessary context is available when it is called, as the "context" field is part of the `qa_data` but is not explicitly provided in the function itself. Additionally, the correct formatting of the "fact" dictionary is essential for the function to perform its task successfully.

**Output Example**: The output of the function is the result of the `_check_answer` method, which typically returns a tuple indicating whether the model's answer is correct and the ROUGE-L score (if applicable). A possible return value could be:
```
(is_correct=True, rouge_score=0.0)
```

### FunctionDef _normalize_text(self, text)
**_normalize_text**: The function of _normalize_text is to standardize the input text by retaining only alphanumeric characters, converting the text to lowercase, and removing any spaces.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· text: The input string that needs to be standardized.

**Code Description**: 
The _normalize_text function is responsible for normalizing an input string by performing the following operations:
1. It removes any non-alphanumeric characters using a regular expression (`re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', text)`), which ensures that only letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and numbers remain in the string.
2. It converts the resulting string to lowercase using the `lower()` method, ensuring case uniformity.
3. It then returns the transformed string.

This function is primarily used within the context of answer verification. For example, the function is called by `_check_answer`, where it plays a key role in standardizing both the model's predicted answer and the ground truth answer. After extracting specific parts of the answers (using a regular expression to find content inside `\boxed{}`), `_normalize_text` is applied to both the model's and the ground truth answers before performing any further comparisons. This standardization ensures that the comparison is made in a consistent format, eliminating discrepancies due to case differences, spacing, or punctuation.

**Note**: 
- The function only retains alphanumeric characters, so punctuation and spaces are completely discarded. Ensure that the input text is appropriate for this kind of transformation.
- This function may be useful in scenarios where exact matches are required and formatting
***
### FunctionDef _check_answer(self, model_answer, ground_truth)
**_check_answer**: The function of _check_answer is to evaluate the model's answer against the expected answer, providing an exact match result or calculating a ROUGE-L score for partial matches.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model_answer: A string representing the answer generated by the model.
· ground_truth: A string representing the correct or expected answer.

**Code Description**: 
The `_check_answer` function is designed to compare a model's answer (`model_answer`) with the expected correct answer (`ground_truth`). It begins by checking if the `model_answer` is `None`, in which case it immediately returns `False` (indicating no match) and a score of `0.0`.

To perform the comparison, the function first uses a regular expression to extract content enclosed in `\boxed{}` from both the `model_answer` and `ground_truth`. These are stored in the lists `model_boxed` and `ground_truth_boxed`, respectively. If both lists are non-empty, the function proceeds to normalize the answers.

The normalization step involves the `_normalize_text` method, which standardizes both the model’s and ground truth answers by removing non-alphanumeric characters, converting them to lowercase, and eliminating any spaces. This ensures that the comparison is made on a consistent, normalized version of the answers, free from case or formatting discrepancies.

After the answers are normalized, the function performs a comparison to check for an exact match. If the model's answer exactly matches the ground truth, it sets `is_correct` to `True` and the `rouge_score` remains at `0.0`. If the answers do not match, the function calculates a ROUGE-L score, which measures the similarity between the two answers, providing a score that indicates the level of partial match.

The function then prints detailed output, including whether the match was exact or partial, along with the original and normalized versions of both the expected answer and the model's answer. The print statements are useful for debugging or analyzing the performance of the model.

Finally, the function returns a tuple: `is_correct` (a boolean indicating whether the model's answer matches the expected answer) and `rouge_score` (a floating-point value representing the ROUGE-L score for partial matches).

The `_check_answer` function is called by the `verify_single_question` function, which is responsible for verifying individual questions by interacting with a model. The `verify_single_question` function gathers the question and its expected answer from a dictionary (`fact`) and passes them to the model. After the model generates an answer, `verify_single_question` calls `_check_answer` to compare the model's answer to the expected answer and return the results.

**Note**: 
- The function relies on the `_normalize_text` method for standardizing the answers. Ensure that the text passed to `_check_answer` contains content enclosed in `\boxed{}` to match the expected structure.
- If either the model's answer or the ground truth answer does not contain content within `\boxed{}`, the function will not proceed with the comparison and will return a score of `0.0`.
- This function is useful in scenarios where exact answer matching is required, and it also supports partial matches through the ROUGE-L score.

**Output Example**: 
An example of the return value could look like this:
```
(is_correct=True, rouge_score=0.0)
```
Or for a partial match:
```
(is_correct=False, rouge_score=75.56)
```

### FunctionDef _calculate_score(self, results, total)
**_calculate_score**: The function of _calculate_score is to compute a final accuracy score based on the results of a verification process.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· results: List - A list of tuples where each tuple contains a boolean indicating whether the answer was correct and the corresponding ROUGE-L score for partial matches.  
· total: int - An integer representing the total number of questions that were verified.

**Code Description**: The _calculate_score function is responsible for calculating a weighted accuracy score based on the verification results of a series of questions. It first counts the number of exact matches by summing up the boolean values from the results list, where a value of `True` indicates a correct answer. Next, it extracts the ROUGE-L scores for the answers that were not exact matches. The average ROUGE-L score is computed by dividing the total of these scores by the total number of questions, ensuring that if there are no ROUGE scores, it defaults to zero.

The final accuracy score is calculated as a weighted average, where 70% of the score is derived from the proportion of exact matches to the total number of questions, and 30% is derived from the average ROUGE-L score. This approach allows for a balanced evaluation of both exact correctness and partial correctness.

The function also includes logging statements that utilize the RichPrinter class to provide a structured output of the verification results. It prints a summary that includes the total number of questions, the number of exact matches, the average ROUGE-L score for partial matches, and the final weighted score. This output is formatted to enhance readability and clarity for users reviewing the verification results.

The _calculate_score function is called by the verify_section method, which is responsible for verifying a series of factual questions. After the verification process is completed, the results are passed to _calculate_score to obtain the overall accuracy score. This score is then returned to indicate the effectiveness of the verification process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the results list accurately reflects the verification outcomes, as the accuracy score is directly dependent on the correctness of the data provided. Proper handling of the total parameter is also crucial to avoid division errors.

**Output Example**: 
Assuming the results list contains the following data: `[(True, 0.9), (False, 0.7), (True, 0.85)]` and the total is 3, the output might look like:
```
Total Questions: 3
Exact Matches: 2/3 (66.67%)
Average ROUGE-L for Partial Matches: 70.00%
Final Weighted Score: 76.67%
```
