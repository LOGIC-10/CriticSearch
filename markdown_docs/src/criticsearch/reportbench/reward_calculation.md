## ClassDef RewardCalculator
**RewardCalculator**: The function of RewardCalculator is to manage and store the details related to the current section's name, its ground truth, and the student's answer for evaluation.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
- current_section_name: Holds the name of the current section being evaluated or processed.
- current_section_ground_truth: Contains the ground truth data for the current section, which is used for comparison with the student’s answer.
- current_section_student_answer: Stores the student's answer for the current section to be evaluated against the ground truth.

**Code Description**:  
The `RewardCalculator` class is a simple container for tracking information related to a specific section within a larger evaluation framework. It holds three key attributes:
1. `current_section_name`: This attribute is used to store the name of the section being worked on or evaluated. It could be a string representing the section's title or identifier, which the model uses to guide its operations.
2. `current_section_ground_truth`: This attribute holds the correct or expected answer for the section, often referred to as the "ground truth." It is likely to be used for comparison with the student’s answer to determine correctness or performance.
3. `current_section_student_answer`: This stores the answer provided by the student for the current section. This answer is intended to be evaluated against the `current_section_ground_truth`.

The class does not have any methods or other functionality defined beyond these attributes. The primary role of this class appears to be to act as a data holder for the current section’s name, the correct answer, and the student's response, which can then be used in further processing, such as scoring or feedback generation.

**Note**:  
- The class is designed with simple attributes and currently lacks any methods for manipulating or processing the data stored within. It could be extended in the future to include methods for evaluating the student's answer or generating reports based on the ground truth.
- The attributes are set to `None` by default, indicating that they are initially unassigned. It is expected that the attributes will be set to specific values during the execution of the larger program that utilizes this class.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the attributes of the object to their default values.

**parameters**: The __init__ function does not accept any parameters apart from the default 'self' parameter, which refers to the instance of the object being created.

**Code Description**:  
This function is the constructor for the class and is called automatically when a new instance of the class is created. It sets the initial values of three instance attributes:
- `self.current_section_name`: Initialized to `None`. This attribute is intended to hold the name of the current section, which can be used by the guide model to search or generate the relevant section.
- `self.current_section_ground_truth`: Also initialized to `None`. This attribute is meant to store the ground truth for the current section, possibly representing the correct or expected content for comparison or validation purposes.
- `self.current_section_student_answer`: Set to `None` initially. This attribute is meant to store the student’s answer for the current section.

The default assignment of `None` allows these attributes to be dynamically updated later in the program's execution as the object interacts with data related to the current section being processed.

**Note**: This constructor method is essential for initializing the object's state when it is instantiated. The attributes set to `None` allow for flexible handling of data later in the object’s lifecycle.
