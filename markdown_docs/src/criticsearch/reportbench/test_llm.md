## FunctionDef test_llm
**test_llm**: The function of test_llm is to test the functionality of the common_chat method in the BaseAgent class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
Â· usr_prompt: A string that serves as the input prompt for the common_chat method.

**Code Description**: The test_llm function initiates a test for the common_chat method of the BaseAgent class. It begins by defining a prompt in Chinese, which translates to "Hello, is the common_chat call successful?" This prompt is then passed to an instance of the BaseAgent class, which is created by invoking its constructor. The common_chat method is called on this instance with the defined prompt as an argument. The response from the common_chat method is captured in the variable 'answer'. Finally, the function prints the response to the console, prefixed by the string "common_chat Response:". This allows the developer to see the output generated by the common_chat method when provided with the specified prompt.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the BaseAgent class and its common_chat method are properly implemented and accessible in the context where test_llm is executed. Additionally, the prompt used in the test should be relevant to the expected functionality of the common_chat method to yield meaningful results.
