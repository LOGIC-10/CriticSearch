## ClassDef ReportEvaluation
**ReportEvaluation**: The function of ReportEvaluation is to evaluate student reports against a benchmark using various assessment methods.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· report_benchmark: An instance of the ReportBenchmark class that provides ground truths and evaluation metrics.
· student_report: A string representing the student's report that is to be evaluated.

**Code Description**: The ReportEvaluation class is designed to facilitate the evaluation of student reports by comparing them against established benchmarks. It utilizes an instance of the ReportBenchmark class to access necessary data and templates for generating assessments.

The constructor method `__init__` initializes the ReportEvaluation object with two parameters: `report_benchmark`, which is an instance of the ReportBenchmark class, and `student_report`, which is a string containing the student's report. This setup allows the class to leverage the functionalities provided by the ReportBenchmark instance throughout its methods.

The method `examinees_outline_generation` generates an outline of the student's report by utilizing a template for outline generation. It retrieves the template from the ReportBenchmark's agent, populates it with the user query, and then renders it to create a prompt. This prompt is sent to the agent's chat function to obtain a response, which represents the generated outline.

The `evaluate_breadth` method assesses the breadth of the student's report by first generating the student's tree structure using the `examinees_outline_generation` method. It then calculates the similarity score between the generated student tree and the ground truth breadth provided by the ReportBenchmark instance using the `tree_similarity` function.

The `evaluate_factualqa` method performs a FactualQA evaluation based on the student's report. It loads a specific template for factual QA, fills it with the user query, ground truth breadth, and the student's report, and then sends this prompt to the agent's chat function to receive a response.

The `extract_student_tree_structure` method is responsible for extracting the structure of the student's report. It uses a template for student tree extraction, populates it with the student's report, and retrieves the response from the agent's chat function, which is then parsed from JSON format.

The `evaluate_depth` method is currently not implemented but is intended to evaluate the depth of the student's report based on the results from the FactualQA evaluation. It is designed to calculate the accuracy of answers extracted from the student report.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the ReportBenchmark instance is properly initialized with the necessary data before creating a ReportEvaluation object. Additionally, the evaluate_depth method is a placeholder and does not currently perform any evaluation.

**Output Example**: 
For the `examinees_outline_generation` method, a possible return value could be:
{
  "Outline": [
    "Introduction",
    "Main Argument",
    "Supporting Evidence",
    "Conclusion"
  ]
} 

For the `evaluate_breadth` method, a possible score could be:
{
  "BreadthScore": 0.85
} 

For the `evaluate_factualqa` method, a possible response could be:
{
  "FactualQAResult": {
    "CorrectAnswers": 5,
    "TotalQuestions": 10,
    "Accuracy": 0.5
  }
} 

For the `extract_student_tree_structure` method, a possible return value could be:
{
  "StudentTree": {
    "Nodes": [
      {"Title": "Introduction", "Content": "This is the introduction."},
      {"Title": "Main Argument", "Content": "This is the main argument."}
    ]
  }
}
### FunctionDef __init__(self, report_benchmark, student_report)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the ReportEvaluation class with a report benchmark and a student report.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· report_benchmark: An instance of the ReportBenchmark class that provides the ground truths for evaluation.  
· student_report: A string representing the report submitted by the student for evaluation.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the ReportEvaluation class. It takes two parameters: report_benchmark and student_report. The report_benchmark parameter is expected to be an instance of the ReportBenchmark class, which is utilized to obtain the ground truths necessary for evaluating the student's report. The student_report parameter is a string that contains the content of the report submitted by the student. Within the constructor, these parameters are assigned to instance variables self.report_benchmark and self.student_report, respectively. This setup allows the ReportEvaluation class to access the benchmark data and the student's report for further processing and evaluation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the report_benchmark parameter is indeed an instance of the ReportBenchmark class to avoid type-related errors during evaluation. Additionally, the student_report should be a valid string representing the report content to ensure proper functionality of the class methods that may utilize these attributes.

### FunctionDef examinees_outline_generation(self)
**examinees_outline_generation**: The function of examinees_outline_generation is to generate a structured outline of student data, referred to as the "student tree," by utilizing a template rendering system and agent communication.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters passed directly to this function.

**Code Description**: 
The `examinees_outline_generation` function is a method within the `ReportEvaluation` class that plays a pivotal role in generating a "student tree" based on a user’s query. The function follows these steps:

1. **Template Loading**: It begins by loading a template file named `outline_generation.txt` using the `load_template` method from the `report_benchmark.agent`. This template serves as a blueprint for the structure and content of the student tree that will be generated.

2. **Data Preparation**: The function then prepares a data dictionary that contains the key `"Query"`, which is assigned the value of `self.report_benchmark.user_query`. This dictionary is essential as it will provide dynamic data to the template during the rendering process.

3. **Template Rendering**: Using the `render_template` method from `report_benchmark.agent`, the function renders the template by passing the template string and the data dictionary. This process customizes the template with the user's query, resulting in a prompt that is tailored to the current context.

4. **Chat Interaction**: The rendered prompt is then passed to the `chat` method of the `report_benchmark.agent`. This method simulates an interactive agent communication, where the agent processes the prompt and returns a response, which, in this case, is the generated student tree.

5. **Return Value**: The function concludes by returning the response received from the agent, which is expected to be a string representing the student tree.

This function is fundamental in generating structured data that can be utilized in further evaluations, particularly in the context of the broader `ReportEvaluation` class.

In relation to its caller, the `evaluate_breadth` function, `examinees_outline_generation` is responsible for generating the student tree, which is then used to compare against a predefined standard tree. The generated student tree is essential for evaluating the breadth of the student's performance, as the similarity between the generated tree and the standard tree is computed in `evaluate_breadth`. The returned string from `examinees_outline_generation` is expected to be parsable into a JSON object, which is required for the similarity calculation.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the response returned by `examinees_outline_generation` adheres to the expected format (i.e., a structured string representation of a student tree) for seamless integration with other functions, particularly `evaluate_breadth`. Any discrepancies in the format may lead to issues in further processing, such as parsing errors or incorrect similarity scores.

**Output Example**: The output is a string that represents the student tree. A mock-up example could be:

```
{
  "student_id": "12345",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "performance": {
    "subject_1": "A",
    "subject_2": "B+",
    "subject_3": "A"
  }
}
```

### FunctionDef evaluate_breadth(self)
**evaluate_breadth**: The function of evaluate_breadth is to evaluate the similarity score between a generated student tree and a predefined standard tree based on breadth.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters passed directly to this function.

**Code Description**: The `evaluate_breadth` function is a method within the `ReportEvaluation` class that is responsible for assessing the breadth of a student's performance by comparing a generated student tree against a ground truth tree structure. The function operates as follows:

1. **Student Tree Generation**: The function first calls the `examinees_outline_generation` method, which generates a structured outline of the student data, referred to as a "student tree." This method utilizes a template rendering system and agent communication to create the student tree based on the user's query.

2. **Parsing the Student Tree**: The output from `examinees_outline_generation` is expected to be a string representation of the student tree. The function then parses this string into a JSON object using `json.loads`, allowing for structured manipulation and comparison.

3. **Similarity Calculation**: The function then calculates the similarity score between the generated student tree and a predefined standard tree (`self.report_benchmark.breadth_gt`) by invoking the `tree_similarity` function. This function computes the semantic and structural similarity score between the two hierarchical tree structures, taking into account various parameters that influence the comparison.

4. **Returning the Score**: Finally, the computed similarity score is returned as the output of the `evaluate_breadth` function. This score reflects how closely the student's tree structure matches the standard tree both semantically and structurally.

The `evaluate_breadth` function is integral to the evaluation process within the `ReportEvaluation` class, as it provides a quantitative measure of the student's performance in relation to established benchmarks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the output from `examinees_outline_generation` is in the expected format for successful parsing. Any discrepancies in the format may lead to errors in the similarity calculation. The `tree_similarity` function, which is called within this method, relies on the proper structure of both the standard and student trees to produce an accurate similarity score.

**Output Example**: The output of the `evaluate_breadth` function is expected to be a floating-point value representing the similarity score. An example return value could be:

```
0.85
``` 

This score indicates a high level of similarity between the generated student tree and the standard tree.

### FunctionDef evaluate_factualqa(self)
**evaluate_factualqa**: The function of evaluate_factualqa is to perform a factual QA evaluation based on the provided StudentReport.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are explicitly passed into the function. However, the method relies on instance variables and attributes of the class to perform its operation.

**Code Description**: 
The `evaluate_factualqa` function is designed to evaluate a StudentReport using a factual question-answering (FactualQA) approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Template Loading**: The function begins by loading a template string, "factual_qa.txt", through the `load_template` method of the `agent` attribute, which is part of the `report_benchmark` instance variable. This template is presumably used to format the evaluation process.

2. **Data Preparation**: It then creates a dictionary called `data` that contains three key-value pairs:
   - `"Query"`: This is populated with the `user_query` from the `report_benchmark`. This likely represents a question or query the model should evaluate.
   - `"BreadthGT"`: This value is assigned the `breadth_gt` attribute, converted into a JSON string format. This attribute appears to contain ground truth data related to the breadth of the evaluation.
   - `"DepthGT"`: This is populated with the `student_report` attribute, which presumably holds the student's report data for evaluation.

3. **Template Rendering**: The `render_template` method is called on the `agent` attribute, passing the loaded template string (`template_str`) and the `data` dictionary. This method likely generates a formatted prompt by embedding the data into the template.

4. **Chat Interaction**: The function then sends the generated prompt to the `chat` method of the `agent` attribute via the `usr_prompt` argument. The `chat` method presumably sends the prompt to a model or system that processes it and returns a response.

5. **Return**: Finally, the response obtained from the `chat` method is returned, which likely contains the results of the factual QA evaluation.

**Note**: 
- The method relies on several instance variables such as `report_benchmark`, `breadth_gt`, and `student_report`, all of which must be properly initialized before this function is called.
- The `chat` method is expected to return a response in a format that can be used to evaluate the factual accuracy of the StudentReport.
- The `load_template` and `render_template` methods are critical for generating the prompt that drives the factual evaluation process, and they depend on a well-structured template file ("factual_qa.txt").

**Output Example**: 
An example of the output might be a response from the `chat` method, such as:

```json
{
  "evaluation": "The report contains correct information regarding the query, but lacks detail in some areas. Further depth is required in the analysis of the topic."
}
```

This output would be generated based on the evaluation of the provided StudentReport in relation to the query.

### FunctionDef extract_student_tree_structure(self)
**extract_student_tree_structure**: The function of extract_student_tree_structure is to extract and return the structured representation of a student's report by utilizing a template and a chat interface.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The extract_student_tree_structure function is designed to facilitate the extraction of a student's report structure. It begins by loading a template from a file named "student_tree_extraction.txt" using the load_template method of the report_benchmark.agent. This template serves as a blueprint for how the student's report data will be formatted. 

Next, the function prepares a data dictionary containing the key "StudentReport" which is assigned the value of the instance variable self.student_report. This dictionary is then passed to the render_template method of the report_benchmark.agent, which processes the template string with the provided data to create a prompt.

The generated prompt is subsequently sent to a chat interface through the chat method of the report_benchmark.agent, which is expected to return a response based on the prompt. Finally, the function parses the response using json.loads to convert the JSON formatted string into a Python object, which is then returned as the output of the function.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the "student_tree_extraction.txt" template file is correctly formatted and accessible. Additionally, the response from the chat method should be in valid JSON format to avoid errors during the parsing step.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "student_id": "12345",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "grades": {
        "math": "A",
        "science": "B+",
        "literature": "A-"
    },
    "attendance": {
        "total_classes": 30,
        "present": 28,
        "absent": 2
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef evaluate_depth(self)
**evaluate_depth**: The function of evaluate_depth is to evaluate the depth of a report based on factual QA results and compute the accuracy of student-generated responses.

**parameters**: 
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The **evaluate_depth** function is currently a placeholder and does not contain any functional implementation. As indicated in the comment within the code, it is intended to implement logic for depth evaluation based on factual QA results. However, the logic is not yet realized. The comment suggests that the function is designed to calculate the accuracy (ACC) of student report-based answers, which will ultimately contribute to determining a final score. The current implementation of this function simply contains a `pass` statement, implying that no action is taken when the function is called.

**Note**: 
- The function is incomplete, and no depth evaluation logic has been implemented yet.
- The function might be extended in the future to include actual calculations or data processing for evaluating the depth of responses in student reports.
