## ClassDef ReportEvaluation
**ReportEvaluation**: The function of ReportEvaluation is to evaluate a student report against predefined benchmarks, specifically assessing the breadth, depth, and factual accuracy of the student's work using the provided report benchmarking tools.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· report_benchmark: An instance of the ReportBenchmark class, used to access the ground truths for evaluating the student report.  
· student_report: A string representing the student's report that will be evaluated.

**Code Description**: The `ReportEvaluation` class is designed to assess the quality of a student’s report by comparing it with a benchmark. It is initialized with two primary parameters: a `report_benchmark` object and the `student_report` string.

- The `__init__` method initializes the class with a `report_benchmark` object, which holds various tools such as templates and ground truth data, and a `student_report` string that contains the student's submission. This method effectively prepares the class for later evaluation tasks.
  
- The `examinees_outline_generation` method uses the `ReportBenchmark` class's `BaseAgent` to generate an outline or tree structure for the student’s report. It loads the necessary template (`outline_generation.txt`) and uses it to create a prompt with the user query. This prompt is then sent to the agent, which returns a response representing the student’s report tree structure. This method is a key part of generating a student’s report structure that will later be used in evaluations.

- The `evaluate_breadth` method evaluates the breadth of the student report by utilizing the `examinees_outline_generation` method to generate a student report tree. The generated tree is compared with the benchmark's breadth ground truth using a function called `tree_similarity`. This comparison results in a score that indicates how well the student’s report matches the expected breadth of coverage.

- The `evaluate_factualqa` method evaluates the factual accuracy of the student report. It first loads the appropriate template (`factual_qa.txt`) and prepares a data dictionary that includes the user query, breadth ground truth, and the student report. The data is then used to create a prompt, which is sent to the agent. The response received is the factual QA evaluation result for the student report, indicating how factually accurate the report is in relation to the given benchmarks.

- The `extract_student_tree_structure` method extracts the logical tree structure of the student report. By loading the `student_tree_extraction.txt` template and providing the student report, it generates a prompt that, when sent to the agent, returns a JSON representation of the student report’s structural elements. This allows for further processing or evaluation of how the student's report is organized.

- The `evaluate_depth` method is a placeholder function intended for evaluating the depth of the student report. While not yet implemented, it is expected that this method will eventually use factual QA results to assess the accuracy of answers related to the depth of the student report and compute a final score based on the comparison.

**Note**: 
- The `evaluate_depth` method is not yet implemented and may require future development to complete the depth evaluation process.
- This class relies on external templates such as `outline_generation.txt`, `factual_qa.txt`, and `student_tree_extraction.txt` to generate prompts for the evaluation process, which means the templates should be available and properly configured in the environment.
- The method `tree_similarity` is used in `evaluate_breadth` to compare the student report’s tree structure with the benchmark’s ground truth; however, the specifics of the `tree_similarity` function are not provided in the current class context.

**Output Example**: 
- The `examinees_outline_generation` method might return a JSON structure like this:
```json
{
  "student_tree": [
    {"section": "Introduction", "content": "Introduction text here..."},
    {"section": "Methodology", "content": "Methodology text here..."},
    {"section": "Conclusion", "content": "Conclusion text here..."}
  ]
}
```
- The `evaluate_breadth` method might return a similarity score, such as:
```json
{
  "breadth_similarity_score": 0.85
}
```
- The `evaluate_factualqa` method might return a factual accuracy response like:
```json
{
  "factual_accuracy_score": 0.92,
  "detailed_feedback": "The report accurately represents the core facts from the benchmark."
}
```
- The `extract_student_tree_structure` method might return a structured representation like:
```json
{
  "student_report_structure": {
    "Introduction": {"section_start": 0, "section_end": 120},
    "Methodology": {"section_start": 121, "section_end": 200},
    "Conclusion": {"section_start": 201, "section_end": 240}
  }
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, report_benchmark, student_report)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the ReportEvaluation class with a ReportBenchmark instance and a student report string.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· report_benchmark: An instance of the ReportBenchmark class, which is used to obtain ground truths for report evaluations.  
· student_report: A string representing the student's report that is to be evaluated.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is the constructor for the ReportEvaluation class. It takes two parameters: report_benchmark and student_report. The report_benchmark parameter is expected to be an instance of the ReportBenchmark class, which is responsible for generating report evaluations by building ground truths and performing fact extraction. The student_report parameter is a string that contains the report of a student, which will be evaluated against the ground truths provided by the ReportBenchmark instance.

Upon initialization, the constructor assigns the report_benchmark instance to the instance variable self.report_benchmark, allowing the ReportEvaluation class to access the methods and attributes of the ReportBenchmark class for further processing. Additionally, the student_report string is stored in the instance variable self.student_report, which will be used in the evaluation process.

The relationship between the ReportEvaluation class and the ReportBenchmark class is crucial, as the ReportEvaluation class relies on the functionalities provided by the ReportBenchmark instance to perform its evaluations. This constructor sets up the necessary context for the ReportEvaluation class to operate effectively, ensuring that it has access to the required ground truths and the specific report that needs to be evaluated.

**Note**: When using the ReportEvaluation class, ensure that the report_benchmark instance is properly initialized with valid data, as it directly influences the evaluation process of the student report.

### FunctionDef examinees_outline_generation(self)
**examinees_outline_generation**: The function of examinees_outline_generation is to generate a structured outline of student data, referred to as the "student tree," by utilizing a template rendering system and agent communication.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters passed directly to this function.

**Code Description**: 
The `examinees_outline_generation` function is a method within the `ReportEvaluation` class that plays a pivotal role in generating a "student tree" based on a user’s query. The function follows these steps:

1. **Template Loading**: It begins by loading a template file named `outline_generation.txt` using the `load_template` method from the `report_benchmark.agent`. This template serves as a blueprint for the structure and content of the student tree that will be generated.

2. **Data Preparation**: The function then prepares a data dictionary that contains the key `"Query"`, which is assigned the value of `self.report_benchmark.user_query`. This dictionary is essential as it will provide dynamic data to the template during the rendering process.

3. **Template Rendering**: Using the `render_template` method from `report_benchmark.agent`, the function renders the template by passing the template string and the data dictionary. This process customizes the template with the user's query, resulting in a prompt that is tailored to the current context.

4. **Chat Interaction**: The rendered prompt is then passed to the `chat` method of the `report_benchmark.agent`. This method simulates an interactive agent communication, where the agent processes the prompt and returns a response, which, in this case, is the generated student tree.

5. **Return Value**: The function concludes by returning the response received from the agent, which is expected to be a string representing the student tree.

This function is fundamental in generating structured data that can be utilized in further evaluations, particularly in the context of the broader `ReportEvaluation` class.

In relation to its caller, the `evaluate_breadth` function, `examinees_outline_generation` is responsible for generating the student tree, which is then used to compare against a predefined standard tree. The generated student tree is essential for evaluating the breadth of the student's performance, as the similarity between the generated tree and the standard tree is computed in `evaluate_breadth`. The returned string from `examinees_outline_generation` is expected to be parsable into a JSON object, which is required for the similarity calculation.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the response returned by `examinees_outline_generation` adheres to the expected format (i.e., a structured string representation of a student tree) for seamless integration with other functions, particularly `evaluate_breadth`. Any discrepancies in the format may lead to issues in further processing, such as parsing errors or incorrect similarity scores.

**Output Example**: The output is a string that represents the student tree. A mock-up example could be:

```
{
  "student_id": "12345",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "performance": {
    "subject_1": "A",
    "subject_2": "B+",
    "subject_3": "A"
  }
}
```

### FunctionDef evaluate_breadth(self)
**evaluate_breadth**: The function of evaluate_breadth is to evaluate the similarity score between a generated student tree and a predefined standard tree based on breadth.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters passed directly to this function.

**Code Description**: The `evaluate_breadth` function is a method within the `ReportEvaluation` class that is responsible for assessing the breadth of a student's performance by comparing a generated student tree against a ground truth tree structure. The function operates as follows:

1. **Student Tree Generation**: The function first calls the `examinees_outline_generation` method, which generates a structured outline of the student data, referred to as a "student tree." This method utilizes a template rendering system and agent communication to create the student tree based on the user's query.

2. **Parsing the Student Tree**: The output from `examinees_outline_generation` is expected to be a string representation of the student tree. The function then parses this string into a JSON object using `json.loads`, allowing for structured manipulation and comparison.

3. **Similarity Calculation**: The function then calculates the similarity score between the generated student tree and a predefined standard tree (`self.report_benchmark.breadth_gt`) by invoking the `tree_similarity` function. This function computes the semantic and structural similarity score between the two hierarchical tree structures, taking into account various parameters that influence the comparison.

4. **Returning the Score**: Finally, the computed similarity score is returned as the output of the `evaluate_breadth` function. This score reflects how closely the student's tree structure matches the standard tree both semantically and structurally.

The `evaluate_breadth` function is integral to the evaluation process within the `ReportEvaluation` class, as it provides a quantitative measure of the student's performance in relation to established benchmarks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the output from `examinees_outline_generation` is in the expected format for successful parsing. Any discrepancies in the format may lead to errors in the similarity calculation. The `tree_similarity` function, which is called within this method, relies on the proper structure of both the standard and student trees to produce an accurate similarity score.

**Output Example**: The output of the `evaluate_breadth` function is expected to be a floating-point value representing the similarity score. An example return value could be:

```
0.85
``` 

This score indicates a high level of similarity between the generated student tree and the standard tree.

### FunctionDef evaluate_factualqa(self)
**evaluate_factualqa**: The function of evaluate_factualqa is to perform a factual QA evaluation based on the provided StudentReport.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are explicitly passed into the function. However, the method relies on instance variables and attributes of the class to perform its operation.

**Code Description**: 
The `evaluate_factualqa` function is designed to evaluate a StudentReport using a factual question-answering (FactualQA) approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Template Loading**: The function begins by loading a template string, "factual_qa.txt", through the `load_template` method of the `agent` attribute, which is part of the `report_benchmark` instance variable. This template is presumably used to format the evaluation process.

2. **Data Preparation**: It then creates a dictionary called `data` that contains three key-value pairs:
   - `"Query"`: This is populated with the `user_query` from the `report_benchmark`. This likely represents a question or query the model should evaluate.
   - `"BreadthGT"`: This value is assigned the `breadth_gt` attribute, converted into a JSON string format. This attribute appears to contain ground truth data related to the breadth of the evaluation.
   - `"DepthGT"`: This is populated with the `student_report` attribute, which presumably holds the student's report data for evaluation.

3. **Template Rendering**: The `render_template` method is called on the `agent` attribute, passing the loaded template string (`template_str`) and the `data` dictionary. This method likely generates a formatted prompt by embedding the data into the template.

4. **Chat Interaction**: The function then sends the generated prompt to the `chat` method of the `agent` attribute via the `usr_prompt` argument. The `chat` method presumably sends the prompt to a model or system that processes it and returns a response.

5. **Return**: Finally, the response obtained from the `chat` method is returned, which likely contains the results of the factual QA evaluation.

**Note**: 
- The method relies on several instance variables such as `report_benchmark`, `breadth_gt`, and `student_report`, all of which must be properly initialized before this function is called.
- The `chat` method is expected to return a response in a format that can be used to evaluate the factual accuracy of the StudentReport.
- The `load_template` and `render_template` methods are critical for generating the prompt that drives the factual evaluation process, and they depend on a well-structured template file ("factual_qa.txt").

**Output Example**: 
An example of the output might be a response from the `chat` method, such as:

```json
{
  "evaluation": "The report contains correct information regarding the query, but lacks detail in some areas. Further depth is required in the analysis of the topic."
}
```

This output would be generated based on the evaluation of the provided StudentReport in relation to the query.
***
### FunctionDef extract_student_tree_structure(self)
**extract_student_tree_structure**: The function of extract_student_tree_structure is to extract a hierarchical tree structure from a student report.

**parameters**: The function does not accept any parameters.

**Code Description**:  
The `extract_student_tree_structure` function is designed to process a student report and generate a hierarchical tree structure based on its content. The function performs the following steps:

1. **Loading Template**: It begins by loading a template file called `student_tree_extraction.txt` using the `load_template` method of the `agent` object. This template is presumably designed to define how the student report's structure should be interpreted.

2. **Rendering Template**: After loading the template, the function prepares the necessary data to feed into the template. This data is a dictionary with the key `"StudentReport"` mapped to the `student_report` attribute of the current object. The template is then rendered by the `render_template` method of the `agent` object, which takes the loaded template and the data dictionary to generate a prompt for further processing.

3. **Generating Response**: The generated prompt is passed to the `chat` method of the `agent` object. The chat function appears to simulate a conversation or query processing with the prompt, returning a response, which is expected to be a string containing structured information.

4. **Parsing JSON Response**: Finally, the function parses the response from the `chat` method using Python's `json.loads()` to convert the string into a Python dictionary or list, which represents the hierarchical tree structure of the student report.

**Note**: 
- The function depends on the availability and correctness of the `student_report` attribute and the `agent` object methods such as `load_template`, `render_template`, and `chat`.
- The template file `student_tree_extraction.txt` must be properly formatted and located in the correct directory for it to be loaded successfully.
- The response returned by the `chat` method must be a valid JSON string, as the function relies on `json.loads()` to convert it into a Python object.

**Output Example**:  
Assuming the student report contains a hierarchical structure, the output might look like the following after parsing the JSON response:

```json
{
  "root": {
    "title": "Student Report",
    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "Personal Information",
        "content": "Details about the student."
      },
      {
        "title": "Academic Performance",
        "content": "Summary of grades and achievements."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This structure represents a tree with a root node titled "Student Report" and two child sections: "Personal Information" and "Academic Performance", each with their own content. The actual structure will depend on the content and formatting of the student report.
***
### FunctionDef evaluate_depth(self)
**evaluate_depth**: The function of evaluate_depth is to evaluate the depth of a report based on factual QA results and compute the accuracy of student-generated responses.

**parameters**: 
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The **evaluate_depth** function is currently a placeholder and does not contain any functional implementation. As indicated in the comment within the code, it is intended to implement logic for depth evaluation based on factual QA results. However, the logic is not yet realized. The comment suggests that the function is designed to calculate the accuracy (ACC) of student report-based answers, which will ultimately contribute to determining a final score. The current implementation of this function simply contains a `pass` statement, implying that no action is taken when the function is called.

**Note**: 
- The function is incomplete, and no depth evaluation logic has been implemented yet.
- The function might be extended in the future to include actual calculations or data processing for evaluating the depth of responses in student reports.
