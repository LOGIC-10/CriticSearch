## ClassDef ReportEvaluation
**ReportEvaluation**: The function of ReportEvaluation is to evaluate a student’s report against a predefined benchmark, using various assessment methods such as breadth, depth, and factual accuracy.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· report_benchmark: This attribute holds an instance of the `ReportBenchmark` class, which is responsible for providing the benchmark data used for comparison and evaluation of the student’s report.
· student_report: This attribute stores the student's report in the form of a string, which will be evaluated based on the comparison with the `ReportBenchmark` data.

**Code Description**: The `ReportEvaluation` class is designed to perform the evaluation of a student's report. It leverages the `ReportBenchmark` instance to obtain ground truth data and perform a series of assessment procedures.

1. **`__init__(self, report_benchmark: ReportBenchmark, student_report: str)`**:
   This is the constructor method for initializing the `ReportEvaluation` object. It accepts two parameters:
   - `report_benchmark`: An instance of the `ReportBenchmark` class, which holds necessary information for comparison such as user queries, ground truth data, and the agent used for interaction.
   - `student_report`: A string containing the student's report that will be evaluated.

   The constructor method assigns these parameters to the corresponding attributes of the `ReportEvaluation` class.

2. **`examinees_outline_generation(self)`**:
   This method generates the student report outline using the `ReportBenchmark` agent. It loads a template file, "outline_generation.txt", and renders it using data from the `ReportBenchmark`, specifically the `user_query`. The method sends the rendered template as a prompt to the `ReportBenchmark` agent and returns the response.

3. **`evaluate_breadth(self)`**:
   This method evaluates the breadth of the student's report. It generates a student tree by calling the `examinees_outline_generation()` method. Then, it compares the generated tree with the benchmark's breadth ground truth (`breadth_gt`) using the `tree_similarity` function, which calculates a similarity score. The result is returned as the evaluation score for breadth.

4. **`evaluate_factualqa(self)`**:
   This method performs a factual QA evaluation using the student's report. It loads the "factual_qa.txt" template, which is used to assess the factual accuracy of the student's report. The method renders this template using both the benchmark's `user_query` and `breadth_gt`, along with the `student_report`. The rendered prompt is sent to the agent, and the response is returned as the evaluation of the factual accuracy.

5. **`extract_student_tree_structure(self)`**:
   This method extracts the logical structure of the student's report. It loads the "student_tree_extraction.txt" template, which is used to analyze the report's structure. After rendering the template with the `student_report`, the resulting response is parsed into a JSON format representing the student’s tree structure. This allows for further analysis of the report’s organization.

6. **`evaluate_depth(self)`**:
   This method is meant to evaluate the depth of the student's report. However, the method is not yet implemented. The description suggests that the depth evaluation would be based on factual QA results, using accuracy (ACC) of student report-based answers to compute a final score. The current implementation does not provide details on the exact logic.

**Note**: 
- The methods in this class depend heavily on templates stored and rendered by the `ReportBenchmark` agent.
- The class provides a flexible structure for evaluating different aspects of a student's report, including outline, breadth, and factual accuracy.
- The `evaluate_depth` method has not been fully implemented, and thus depth evaluation cannot currently be performed.

**Output Example**:
- For `evaluate_breadth`, an output might look like:
  ```json
  0.85
  ```
  This score represents the similarity between the student’s tree structure and the benchmark’s breadth ground truth.

- For `evaluate_factualqa`, an output could be:
  ```json
  {
    "accuracy": 0.92,
    "feedback": "The factual accuracy of the student’s report is 92%."
  }
  ```
  This result indicates the factual accuracy score of the student’s report, along with feedback.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, report_benchmark, student_report)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the ReportEvaluation class with a ReportBenchmark instance and a student report string.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· report_benchmark: An instance of the ReportBenchmark class, which is used to obtain ground truths for report evaluations.  
· student_report: A string representing the student's report that is to be evaluated.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is the constructor for the ReportEvaluation class. It takes two parameters: report_benchmark and student_report. The report_benchmark parameter is expected to be an instance of the ReportBenchmark class, which is responsible for generating report evaluations by building ground truths and performing fact extraction. The student_report parameter is a string that contains the report of a student, which will be evaluated against the ground truths provided by the ReportBenchmark instance.

Upon initialization, the constructor assigns the report_benchmark instance to the instance variable self.report_benchmark, allowing the ReportEvaluation class to access the methods and attributes of the ReportBenchmark class for further processing. Additionally, the student_report string is stored in the instance variable self.student_report, which will be used in the evaluation process.

The relationship between the ReportEvaluation class and the ReportBenchmark class is crucial, as the ReportEvaluation class relies on the functionalities provided by the ReportBenchmark instance to perform its evaluations. This constructor sets up the necessary context for the ReportEvaluation class to operate effectively, ensuring that it has access to the required ground truths and the specific report that needs to be evaluated.

**Note**: When using the ReportEvaluation class, ensure that the report_benchmark instance is properly initialized with valid data, as it directly influences the evaluation process of the student report.

### FunctionDef examinees_outline_generation(self)
**examinees_outline_generation**: The function of examinees_outline_generation is to generate a student outline tree by utilizing a template rendering system and agent communication from the ReportBenchmark.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters passed to this function directly. It relies on the internal attributes of the `report_benchmark` object.

**Code Description**: 
The `examinees_outline_generation` function is responsible for generating a structured outline of the student data, referred to as a "student tree," using the `ReportBenchmark`'s `BaseAgent`. The function performs the following steps:

1. It loads a template file named `outline_generation.txt` using the `load_template` method of the `agent` object from `report_benchmark`. This template likely contains predefined instructions or a structure for generating the student outline.

2. Next, it creates a data dictionary containing the user's query, retrieved from `report_benchmark.user_query`. This user query represents the input or context that will be used in the generation process.

3. The template string loaded in step 1 is then rendered with the data dictionary using the `render_template` method of the `agent`. This step dynamically fills the template with the provided data (in this case, the user query) to create a customized prompt.

4. The function sends the generated prompt to the agent for further processing by calling `common_chat` on the agent, passing the generated prompt as the `usr_prompt`. This step likely involves communicating with an external system or using an internal service to process the prompt and generate a response.

5. The response, which is expected to be the student outline tree in string format, is returned as the output of the function.

The function does not take any parameters directly; instead, it relies on the `report_benchmark` attribute, which is assumed to be an instance of a class that holds the necessary data, such as the `user_query` and the `agent` responsible for communication and template handling.

In the context of the project, this function is called by the `evaluate_breadth` function. The `evaluate_breadth` function calls `examinees_outline_generation` to generate the student tree, then parses the returned string into a JSON object, which is compared to a ground truth value (`breadth_gt`) to calculate a similarity score using the `tree_similarity` function. This indicates that `examinees_outline_generation` is a part of the process that evaluates the breadth of student performance or outlines.

**Note**: 
- The function relies heavily on the `report_benchmark` object, and any changes to this object may affect the function's behavior.
- The response returned by `examinees_outline_generation` is expected to be in a specific format (likely a structured string representing a tree). Any discrepancies in the format may lead to errors in downstream processing.
- This function is expected to interact with an external agent (through `common_chat`), so the performance or response times may depend on the efficiency and reliability of that external system.

**Output Example**: 
The output is expected to be a string representing the generated student tree. An example response could look like:

```
{
    "student_id": "12345",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "performance": {
        "subject_1": "A",
        "subject_2": "B",
        "subject_3": "A"
    },
    "remarks": "Excellent performance in all subjects"
}
```

### FunctionDef evaluate_breadth(self)
**evaluate_breadth**: The function of evaluate_breadth is to evaluate the similarity score between a generated student tree and a predefined standard tree based on breadth.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters passed directly to this function.

**Code Description**: The `evaluate_breadth` function is a method within the `ReportEvaluation` class that is responsible for assessing the breadth of a student's performance by comparing a generated student tree against a ground truth tree structure. The function operates as follows:

1. **Student Tree Generation**: The function first calls the `examinees_outline_generation` method, which generates a structured outline of the student data, referred to as a "student tree." This method utilizes a template rendering system and agent communication to create the student tree based on the user's query.

2. **Parsing the Student Tree**: The output from `examinees_outline_generation` is expected to be a string representation of the student tree. The function then parses this string into a JSON object using `json.loads`, allowing for structured manipulation and comparison.

3. **Similarity Calculation**: The function then calculates the similarity score between the generated student tree and a predefined standard tree (`self.report_benchmark.breadth_gt`) by invoking the `tree_similarity` function. This function computes the semantic and structural similarity score between the two hierarchical tree structures, taking into account various parameters that influence the comparison.

4. **Returning the Score**: Finally, the computed similarity score is returned as the output of the `evaluate_breadth` function. This score reflects how closely the student's tree structure matches the standard tree both semantically and structurally.

The `evaluate_breadth` function is integral to the evaluation process within the `ReportEvaluation` class, as it provides a quantitative measure of the student's performance in relation to established benchmarks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the output from `examinees_outline_generation` is in the expected format for successful parsing. Any discrepancies in the format may lead to errors in the similarity calculation. The `tree_similarity` function, which is called within this method, relies on the proper structure of both the standard and student trees to produce an accurate similarity score.

**Output Example**: The output of the `evaluate_breadth` function is expected to be a floating-point value representing the similarity score. An example return value could be:

```
0.85
``` 

This score indicates a high level of similarity between the generated student tree and the standard tree.

### FunctionDef evaluate_factualqa(self)
**evaluate_factualqa**: The function of evaluate_factualqa is to perform a FactualQA evaluation based on the provided StudentReport.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: An instance of the class that contains the report_benchmark and student_report attributes.

**Code Description**: The evaluate_factualqa function is designed to execute a FactualQA evaluation using the information contained within the StudentReport. The function begins by loading a template string from a file named "factual_qa.txt" using the load_template method of the agent associated with report_benchmark. This template serves as a basis for constructing a prompt that will be sent for evaluation.

Next, the function constructs a data dictionary that includes:
- "Query": This key holds the user query from the report_benchmark.
- "BreadthGT": This key contains the ground truth for breadth, which is serialized into a JSON format from the breadth_gt attribute of report_benchmark.
- "DepthGT": This key directly references the student_report, which is expected to contain the depth ground truth for the evaluation.

The prompt is then generated by rendering the template string with the data dictionary using the render_template method of the agent. Following this, the function calls the common_chat method of the agent, passing the constructed prompt as the usr_prompt argument. This method is responsible for processing the prompt and generating a response based on the evaluation.

Finally, the function returns the response obtained from the common_chat method, which is expected to contain the results of the FactualQA evaluation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the template file "factual_qa.txt" exists and is correctly formatted, as the function relies on this template for generating the evaluation prompt. Additionally, the attributes report_benchmark and student_report must be properly initialized within the class instance for the function to operate correctly.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the evaluate_factualqa function could be a JSON object containing the evaluation results, such as:
{
    "evaluation_score": 0.85,
    "feedback": "The answer is mostly correct but lacks depth in certain areas."
}

### FunctionDef extract_student_tree_structure(self)
**extract_student_tree_structure**: The function of extract_student_tree_structure is to extract the directory tree structure from a given student report.

**parameters**: 
· None

**Code Description**:  
The **extract_student_tree_structure** function is responsible for extracting the directory tree structure from the student report. The function operates as follows:

1. **Load Template**: It starts by loading a template file, named `"student_tree_extraction.txt"`, using the `load_template` method from the `report_benchmark.agent`. This template is assumed to contain the necessary structure or instructions for processing the student report.

2. **Prepare Data**: The function then prepares a dictionary with the key `"StudentReport"` which holds the `self.student_report` value. This suggests that the `self.student_report` contains the actual data of the student report to be processed.

3. **Render Template**: Next, the function renders the loaded template using the `render_template` method of the `report_benchmark.agent`. It passes the template string (`template_str`) and the data dictionary (`data`) as parameters to generate a prompt. The prompt generated will likely contain placeholders or specific instructions based on the template, filled with the relevant data from the student report.

4. **Chat with Agent**: The generated prompt is then sent to the `common_chat` method of the `report_benchmark.agent`. This method interacts with a system (likely a model or an agent) that processes the prompt and returns a response. The interaction here is presumably for processing or extracting the tree structure from the student report based on the prompt.

5. **Parse Response**: Finally, the response from the `common_chat` method is expected to be in a JSON format. The `json.loads(response)` function is used to parse this JSON string into a Python dictionary or object, which is then returned as the output of the function.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the student report (`self.student_report`) is already available and properly formatted.
- The template `"student_tree_extraction.txt"` should exist in the specified location and be structured correctly to work with the `render_template` method.
- The `common_chat` method's response is expected to be a JSON string that can be parsed directly with `json.loads()`.

**Output Example**:
Assuming the student report contains data structured with sections, the output might look like the following:

```json
{
  "root": {
    "name": "Student Report",
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "Personal Information",
        "children": [
          {
            "name": "Name",
            "value": "John Doe"
          },
          {
            "name": "ID",
            "value": "12345"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Grades",
        "children": [
          {
            "name": "Math",
            "value": "A"
          },
          {
            "name": "Science",
            "value": "B"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
In this output example, the directory tree structure of the student report is represented as a hierarchical JSON object, where each node contains a `name` and can have `children` representing nested sections or data.
***
### FunctionDef evaluate_depth(self)
**evaluate_depth**: The function of evaluate_depth is to evaluate the depth of a report based on factual QA results and compute the accuracy of student-generated responses.

**parameters**: 
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The **evaluate_depth** function is currently a placeholder and does not contain any functional implementation. As indicated in the comment within the code, it is intended to implement logic for depth evaluation based on factual QA results. However, the logic is not yet realized. The comment suggests that the function is designed to calculate the accuracy (ACC) of student report-based answers, which will ultimately contribute to determining a final score. The current implementation of this function simply contains a `pass` statement, implying that no action is taken when the function is called.

**Note**: 
- The function is incomplete, and no depth evaluation logic has been implemented yet.
- The function might be extended in the future to include actual calculations or data processing for evaluating the depth of responses in student reports.
