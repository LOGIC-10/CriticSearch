## FunctionDef filter_node(node)
**filter_node**: The function of filter_node is to recursively filter a data structure, specifically a dictionary or list, by removing any entries that contain an 'id' with the letter "s" in it.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· node: The input data structure, which can be a dictionary, list, or any other data type.

**Code Description**: The filter_node function is designed to traverse a given data structure, which may be a dictionary or a list, and filter out specific entries based on the presence of an 'id' key. If the 'id' key exists and contains the letter "s" (case insensitive), that entry is excluded from the output. 

When the input is a dictionary, the function checks each key-value pair. If a key-value pair meets the filtering criteria (i.e., contains an 'id' with "s"), it returns None for that entry. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on the value to continue filtering deeper into the structure. The resulting filtered entries are collected into a new dictionary, which is returned at the end of the function.

If the input is a list, the function iterates through each item in the list, applying the same filtering logic. Filtered items that do not meet the exclusion criteria are appended to a new list, which is returned.

If the input is neither a dictionary nor a list, the function simply returns the input as is. This behavior ensures that the function can handle mixed data types gracefully.

The filter_node function is called within the extractDirectoryTree function, which reads a JSON file and constructs a tree structure from its contents. After loading the JSON data, extractDirectoryTree invokes filter_node to filter the data based on the specified criteria before proceeding to build a tree structure and validate it as valid JSON. This integration highlights the importance of filter_node in ensuring that only relevant data is processed and included in the final output.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input to filter_node is either a dictionary or a list for the function to operate correctly. If the input does not conform to these types, the function will return the input unchanged.

**Output Example**: Given an input like the following dictionary:
{
    "id": "123",
    "title": "Sample Title",
    "children": [
        {"id": "s456", "title": "Excluded Title"},
        {"id": "789", "title": "Included Title"}
    ]
}
The output of filter_node would be:
{
    "id": "123",
    "title": "Sample Title",
    "children": [
        {"id": "789", "title": "Included Title"}
    ]
}
## FunctionDef build_tree(node)
**build_tree**: The function of build_tree is to recursively construct a tree structure from a given node, extracting only the "title" and optionally including "children" based on the content.

**parameters**: 
- node: A dictionary or list representing the current node to be processed in the tree construction.

**Code Description**:  
The `build_tree` function is designed to recursively transform a given node (which can be either a dictionary or a list) into a simplified tree structure. This tree only includes the "title" field and, when applicable, a list of "children" nodes, which are also processed recursively.

The function starts by checking the type of the `node`:
1. **When the node is a dictionary**:  
   - If the dictionary contains a "title" key, a new dictionary is created with just the "title" from the original node. 
   - It then checks for the presence of a "content" key, which, if it's a list, indicates that the node has child elements. The function then processes each child recursively using the same `build_tree` function.
   - If child trees are found, they are added to the "children" key of the new node.
   - If the node doesn’t contain a "title" but has "content", the function proceeds by building the children for the "content" and, if children are found, returns a dictionary containing just the "children".
   
2. **When the node is a list**:  
   - The function iterates through each item in the list, calling `build_tree` recursively for each. It collects and returns all resulting trees in a list.
   - If no valid trees are returned, it returns `None`.

3. **When the node is neither a dictionary nor a list**, it returns `None`.

The function ensures that only the title and children (if any) are retained in the final tree structure, and this structure can be nested depending on the depth of the input data.

From a functional perspective, this function is used by the `extractDirectoryTree` function to simplify and reformat a potentially complex JSON structure into a tree with only titles and hierarchical relationships. This tree structure can then be further validated or processed as needed.

**Note**: 
- The input data passed into `build_tree` should be either a dictionary or a list of dictionaries that include "title" and optionally "content" keys.
- If the "content" field contains a list, the function will process it recursively.
- The function can return either a single node (with a title and children) or a list of nodes, depending on the structure of the input.

**Output Example**:  
If the input data is as follows:
```json
{
    "title": "Root",
    "content": [
        {
            "title": "Child 1",
            "content": []
        },
        {
            "title": "Child 2",
            "content": [
                {
                    "title": "Grandchild 1"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The output of the `build_tree` function would be:
```json
{
    "title": "Root",
    "children": [
        {
            "title": "Child 1"
        },
        {
            "title": "Child 2",
            "children": [
                {
                    "title": "Grandchild 1"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
## FunctionDef build_markdown(node, level)
**build_markdown**: The function of build_markdown is to recursively generate markdown text from a given JSON structure, extracting titles and sentences while ignoring references.

**parameters**:
· node: A dictionary or list representing the current level of the JSON content being processed.  
· level: An integer representing the current level of recursion, defaulting to 1. 

**Code Description**:  
The `build_markdown` function is designed to recursively traverse a JSON structure, extracting specific content to generate markdown text. This function is primarily used to convert JSON data into a readable markdown format, which includes the titles and sentence text but excludes any reference data.

1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts a `node`, which can be a dictionary or a list. If it is a dictionary, the function checks for the presence of certain keys, such as `title`, `sentences`, and `content`. The key `title` will be converted into a markdown header (using `#` characters based on the `level` argument), and `sentences` will be processed to extract the text to be included in the markdown output.

2. **Markdown Construction**:
   - If the node is a dictionary, the function checks if the node contains a `title`. If found, the title is prepended with `#` characters, based on the current level of recursion (`level`), followed by the title itself and a newline.
   - Next, if the node has a `sentences` key containing a list, the function iterates through each sentence and appends the `text` of the sentence to the markdown.
   - The function also recursively processes child nodes under the `content` key, if present, by calling `build_markdown` on each child node, increasing the `level` by 1 to indicate the deeper hierarchy in the markdown.

3. **List Handling**: If the `node` is a list, the function processes each item in the list by calling `build_markdown` on each item. This ensures that the function can handle both list and dictionary-based JSON structures.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the accumulated markdown content as a string, which includes titles, sentences, and recursively processed content from nested structures.

This function plays a key role in processing structured data and converting it into a markdown format suitable for human-readable documentation. It is used by other parts of the project, such as in the `extractMarkdownContent` function, which loads a JSON file and passes the data to `build_markdown` to generate markdown content from the JSON structure.

**Note**: This function only processes data associated with `title` and `sentences`, excluding references or other data that might be present in the JSON. Therefore, the output will consist only of text data that is relevant to the markdown generation process.

**Output Example**:  
For a JSON structure like:
```json
{
  "title": "Main Title",
  "sentences": [
    {"text": "This is the first sentence."},
    {"text": "This is the second sentence."}
  ],
  "content": [
    {
      "title": "Sub Title 1",
      "sentences": [
        {"text": "Subsentence 1.1"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The output markdown generated by `build_markdown` would be:
```
# Main Title

This is the first sentence.

This is the second sentence.

## Sub Title 1

Subsentence 1.1
```
## FunctionDef build_section_content_pairs(node)
**build_section_content_pairs**: The function of build_section_content_pairs is to recursively construct a tree-like structure of section-content pairs.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: node - A dictionary representing a section of a document. This dictionary may contain a title, content, and other possible children sections.

**Code Description**: The build_section_content_pairs function is designed to process a section of a document and construct a hierarchical structure of section-content pairs. This structure includes the section's title, the content within the section, references within the content, and any child sections that may exist.

- The function begins by verifying that the input node is a dictionary. If the input is not a dictionary or does not contain a "title" key, it returns `None`, indicating that the node is not a valid section.
- The function then initializes a `result` dictionary, which will hold the section's title.
- A helper function, `process_sentences`, is defined and used to extract the text and references from the sentences contained within a section. It checks if the content has the "sentences" key and extracts the relevant information from each sentence. Text content is added to a list, and references are collected in a set to avoid duplicates.
- The function checks if the node contains direct content that is not part of a child section. If such content exists, it processes these sentences and adds them to the result.
- The function proceeds to gather any references associated with the text and adds them to the result. The references are sorted before being added.
- The function then looks for child sections in the current node's content. If any child sections are found, the function recursively calls itself to process those children and add them to the "children" list of the result.
- Finally, the function returns the `result` dictionary, which contains the title, content, references, and any children sections of the node, following the section-content pair structure.

This function is called by the `extractSectionContentPairs` function. The `extractSectionContentPairs` function reads a JSON file, loads the data, and calls `build_section_content_pairs` to construct the section-content pairs. After constructing the structure, it validates the structure by attempting to serialize it back into a JSON string and then deserializing it to ensure that the structure is valid. The validated section-content pairs are then returned.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes that the input node is a valid section that may or may not contain child sections. 
- The text content in the section is extracted from sentences within the node and any items in the "content" list that are not child sections.
- Only sections with a "title" are processed, while non-section content is treated as plain text and processed accordingly.
- The function ensures that references are collected without duplication by using a set, which is later sorted before being returned.
  
**Output Example**: A possible return value could look like this:

```json
{
    "title": "Introduction",
    "content": "This is the introductory section of the document.",
    "references": ["ref1", "ref2"],
    "children": [
        {
            "title": "Background",
            "content": "This section provides the background information.",
            "references": ["ref3"],
            "children": []
        },
        {
            "title": "Objectives",
            "content": "This section outlines the objectives of the study.",
            "references": ["ref4", "ref5"],
            "children": []
        }
    ]
}
```
### FunctionDef process_sentences(content)
**process_sentences**: The function of process_sentences is to extract and collect specific information from a structured content input, particularly focusing on sentence text and references.

**parameters**: The parameters of this function.
· content: A dictionary that may contain a list of sentences, each potentially with text and references.

**Code Description**: The function `process_sentences` processes the input `content`, which is expected to be a dictionary. It first checks if the dictionary contains a key named "sentences". If this key exists, the function proceeds to iterate over each item in the "sentences" list. For each item in the list, the function performs further checks:
1. It ensures that the item is a dictionary.
2. If the dictionary contains a key "text", it appends the stripped text of the sentence to a global or previously defined list, `text_parts`.
3. Additionally, if the dictionary contains a "references" key and the value associated with this key is a list, it updates a global or previously defined set, `references`, by adding all items from the references list.

The function is intended to process structured sentence data, extracting relevant text and references, which can later be used for further processing or analysis.

**Note**: 
- The function does not return any value; it modifies external variables (`text_parts` and `references`).
- The function assumes that the structure of `content` and each sentence is consistent with the described format. Any deviation (e.g., missing expected keys or non-list values where lists are expected) may lead to no processing or errors.
- The variables `text_parts` and `references` should be initialized before the function is called to ensure that the function has a place to store the extracted data.
***
## FunctionDef extractDirectoryTree(input_file_path)
**extractDirectoryTree**: The function of extractDirectoryTree is to read a JSON file, filter its contents based on specific criteria, build a hierarchical tree structure from the filtered data, and validate the resulting structure as valid JSON.

**parameters**: 
· input_file_path: A string representing the path to the input JSON file that will be read and processed.

**Code Description**: The extractDirectoryTree function begins by opening and reading a JSON file specified by the input_file_path parameter. It uses the json library to load the contents of the file into a Python data structure. The function then calls the filter_node function to filter the loaded data. This filtering process removes any entries that contain an 'id' with the letter "s" in it, ensuring that only relevant data is retained for further processing.

After filtering, the function invokes the build_tree function, which constructs a simplified tree structure that includes only the "title" and its associated "children" nodes. This tree structure is essential for representing the hierarchical relationships within the data.

To ensure the integrity of the resulting tree structure, the function attempts to serialize the tree into a JSON string and then deserialize it back into a Python object. This step serves as a validation check to confirm that the tree structure is valid JSON. If the serialization or deserialization fails, a ValueError is raised, indicating that the structure is invalid.

Finally, the function returns the validated tree structure, which can be utilized by other components of the application. The extractDirectoryTree function is called within the __init__ method of the ReportBenchmark class, where it is used to extract a breadth ground truth representation from the specified JSON input path. This integration highlights the function's role in preparing data for further analysis and reporting within the broader context of the application.

**Note**: It is crucial that the input JSON file adheres to the expected structure, as the filtering and tree-building processes depend on the presence of specific keys such as "id" and "title". Any deviations from this structure may lead to unexpected results or errors during execution.

**Output Example**: Given a valid input JSON file, the output of the extractDirectoryTree function might resemble the following structure:
```json
{
    "title": "Root Node",
    "children": [
        {
            "title": "Child Node 1"
        },
        {
            "title": "Child Node 2",
            "children": [
                {
                    "title": "Grandchild Node"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
## FunctionDef extractMarkdownContent(input_file_path)
**extractMarkdownContent**: The function of extractMarkdownContent is to read a JSON file and convert its content into a markdown format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· input_file_path: A string representing the path to the input JSON file that contains the data to be processed.

**Code Description**: The extractMarkdownContent function is responsible for reading a JSON file specified by the input_file_path parameter. It opens the file in read mode with UTF-8 encoding and loads its content into a Python dictionary using the json.load function. Once the JSON data is loaded, the function calls the build_markdown function, passing the loaded data as an argument. The build_markdown function processes the JSON structure recursively, extracting titles and sentences to generate a markdown representation of the content. After the markdown text is generated, extractMarkdownContent returns this text as a string instead of saving it to a file.

This function is utilized within the ReportBenchmark class's __init__ method, where it is called to extract markdown content from the JSON input path provided during the instantiation of the class. The markdown content generated by extractMarkdownContent is then used to create sections for the report, demonstrating its role in transforming structured JSON data into a human-readable markdown format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input JSON file is correctly formatted and contains the expected structure, as the function relies on the presence of specific keys to generate the markdown content accurately.

**Output Example**: For a JSON structure like:
```json
{
  "title": "Sample Title",
  "sentences": [
    {"text": "This is a sample sentence."},
    {"text": "This is another sample sentence."}
  ],
  "content": [
    {
      "title": "Subsection Title",
      "sentences": [
        {"text": "This is a sentence in the subsection."}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
The output markdown generated by extractMarkdownContent would be:
```
# Sample Title

This is a sample sentence.

This is another sample sentence.

## Subsection Title

This is a sentence in the subsection.
```
## FunctionDef extractSectionContentPairs(input_file_path)
**extractSectionContentPairs**: The function of extractSectionContentPairs is to extract a structured set of section-content pairs from a JSON file and validate the structure.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: input_file_path (str) - The path to the JSON file that contains the data to be processed.

**Code Description**: The function `extractSectionContentPairs` is designed to extract and return a structured set of section-content pairs from a given JSON file. It follows these main steps:

1. **Reading the JSON File**: The function first opens and reads the JSON file specified by the `input_file_path` parameter. It uses Python's built-in `json.load()` method to parse the contents of the file into a Python dictionary.

2. **Building Section-Content Pairs**: After loading the data, the function calls the `build_section_content_pairs` function, which is responsible for constructing the hierarchical structure of section-content pairs from the data. This function processes the JSON structure recursively to create a tree-like representation of the sections and their associated content.

3. **Validating the Structure**: The function then attempts to validate the generated structure by serializing it into a JSON string using `json.dumps()` and deserializing it back into a Python object using `json.loads()`. This step ensures that the resulting data structure adheres to valid JSON formatting. If any error occurs during this process (e.g., invalid or malformed data), a `ValueError` is raised with a message indicating the specific issue.

4. **Returning the Validated Pairs**: After validation, the function returns the validated section-content pairs structure, which is in the form of a dictionary containing titles, content, references, and child sections (if any).

In the broader context of the project, the `extractSectionContentPairs` function is invoked within the `ReportBenchmark` class's `__init__` method. Specifically, it is called to extract the section-content pairs from the input JSON file, which is then used as part of the initialization process for creating a report benchmark. The section-content pairs are essential for further processing and organizing the content into structured sections.

The function also relies on the `build_section_content_pairs` function to construct the section-content pairs. This helper function is responsible for processing each section recursively and ensuring that sections, their content, and any child sections are correctly represented in the final structure.

**Note**: 
- The input file must be a valid JSON file containing a structure that can be processed into section-content pairs.
- The validation step ensures that the resulting structure is compatible with standard JSON formatting, which prevents issues during further processing.
- The `build_section_content_pairs` function should return a valid structure for each section in the input data to ensure proper functionality.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `extractSectionContentPairs` function could look like this:

```json
{
    "title": "Introduction",
    "content": "This is the introductory section of the document.",
    "references": ["ref1", "ref2"],
    "children": [
        {
            "title": "Background",
            "content": "This section provides the background information.",
            "references": ["ref3"],
            "children": []
        },
        {
            "title": "Objectives",
            "content": "This section outlines the objectives of the study.",
            "references": ["ref4", "ref5"],
            "children": []
        }
    ]
}
```
## FunctionDef extract_markdown_sections(md_text)
**extract_markdown_sections**: The function of extract_markdown_sections is to extract markdown sections based on header lines.

**parameters**:
· md_text: A string representing the markdown text from which sections will be extracted.

**Code Description**: The `extract_markdown_sections` function processes a given markdown text (`md_text`) and divides it into sections based on headers, which are lines that start with the `#` symbol. It iterates through each line of the markdown text, identifying these header lines and treating them as boundaries between different sections. 

- The function initializes two variables: `sections` (an empty list to store the resulting sections) and `current_section` (an empty list that temporarily holds the lines of the current section being processed).
- It then loops through each line of the markdown text:
  - If the line starts with `#` (indicating a header), the function checks whether there is any content in `current_section`. If so, it joins the lines of `current_section` into a single string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and appends it to the `sections` list.
  - After handling the previous section, `current_section` is reset to an empty list, and the new section starts accumulating lines.
  - If the line does not start with a header, it is simply added to the current section being processed.
- After the loop finishes, the function checks if there is any remaining content in `current_section` and appends it to the `sections` list if necessary.
- The function returns the `sections` list, where each element is a string representing a separate section of the original markdown content.

This function is primarily called within the `ReportBenchmark` class constructor in `src/criticsearch/reportbench/report_benchmark.py`. In that context, it is used to process the markdown content of a report, splitting the content into distinct sections, each corresponding to a markdown header. These sections are then stored in the `sections` attribute, which can be used later in the class for generating reports or performing other operations related to the markdown content.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the markdown content is formatted correctly with headers starting with `#`.
- It does not handle cases where headers are malformed or have no content between them.
- The function processes the markdown text line by line, so it may not handle large files efficiently in cases of extreme text sizes.

**Output Example**:
Given an input markdown text:

```
# Section 1
This is the first section.

# Section 2
This is the second section.
```

The function would return the following list:

```
[
    "# Section 1\nThis is the first section.",
    "# Section 2\nThis is the second section."
]
```
