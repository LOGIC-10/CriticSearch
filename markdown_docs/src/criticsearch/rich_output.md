## ClassDef RichPrinter
**RichPrinter**: The function of RichPrinter is to provide a set of methods for printing styled messages, handling exception printing, and saving console output to a file.

**attributes**:
· console: Console  
· default_title_style: str  
· default_line_characters: str  

**Code Description**:  
The `RichPrinter` class is designed to work with the `Console` class, most likely from the `rich` library, to enable styled and formatted output to the terminal. The class also includes features for printing exceptions and saving console output to a file.

- **console**: This attribute stores an instance of the `Console` class. If no `Console` instance is provided during the initialization of `RichPrinter`, a new `Console` instance is created with `record=True`. The `record` parameter indicates that the console should capture the output for later use or export.
  
- **default_title_style**: This string attribute sets the default style for titles printed using the `rule` method. The default style is `[cyan bold]`, which means titles will appear in cyan and bold when printed.
  
- **default_line_characters**: This attribute defines the default character used to create a line or separator in printed rules. By default, the character is the equal sign (`=`).

The class provides the following methods:

1. **__init__(self, console: Console = None)**:  
   The constructor method initializes the `RichPrinter` object. If a `Console` object is passed as a parameter, it uses that; otherwise, it creates a new `Console` instance with the `record` set to `True`.

2. **rule(self, title: str)**:  
   This method prints a decorative rule (a line) with a title. The title is printed with the default title style (`[cyan bold]`), and the line separating the title is formed using the default line characters (`=`). It calls the `console.rule` method to render the rule.

3. **log(self, message: str, style: str = None)**:  
   This method prints a log message using the `console.log` method. The message is printed with an optional style, which defaults to `None` if no style is provided.

4. **print(self, message: str, style: str = None)**:  
   Similar to the `log` method, this method prints a regular message to the console using the `console.print` method. Again, the message can be styled by passing an optional `style` argument.

5. **print_exception(self, message: str, max_frames: int = 5)**:  
   This method prints an exception message with a bold red style using the `console.print_exception` method. It also allows controlling the number of stack frames shown when printing the exception, defaulting to 5 frames. Before printing the exception, it uses the `log` method to display the exception message in red, bold.

6. **save_output_to_file(self, file_path: Path = Path("output.txt"))**:  
   This method saves the output of the `Console` object to a specified file. It creates a new `Console` instance that writes to the file. It exports the current text output captured by the original console and saves it to the given file path. The method ensures that a rule is added at the end of the file to mark that the output has been successfully written.

**Note**:  
- The `save_output_to_file` method exports the content of the console as plain text. It is important to ensure that the file path provided is accessible and writable.  
- The default behavior of printing to the console and exporting to a file is meant to be flexible, allowing users to either view the output directly or save it for later inspection.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, console)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the instance of the `RichPrinter` class and configure its attributes, including setting up a default `Console` instance and assigning default styles for the title and line separator.

**parameters**: 
· console: Optional. An instance of the `Console` class. If not provided, a new `Console` object will be created.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` function is the constructor method of the `RichPrinter` class. It initializes the object with two main responsibilities:
1. It accepts an optional `console` parameter, which is an instance of the `Console` class. If no `console` is passed to the constructor, it defaults to creating a new `Console` instance with the `record=True` parameter, enabling the recording of the output.
2. It sets up default style and formatting attributes:
   - `default_title_style`: This is set to "[cyan bold]", defining the default style for titles to be cyan and bold.
   - `default_line_characters`: This is set to `"="`, which specifies that the default character for line separators will be the equals sign (`=`).

This constructor ensures that the `RichPrinter` class has the necessary setup for its output, including the ability to log or record the output and use consistent styling for its visual presentation.

**Note**: If a custom `Console` instance is passed, it will be used instead of the default one. Additionally, the default style settings can be overridden later in the class, but they serve as initial values for title and line separator styling.
***
### FunctionDef rule(self, title)
**rule**: The function of rule is to print a visual separator in the console output with a specified title.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· title: A string that contains the title to be displayed in the rule.

**Code Description**: The rule function is a method within the RichPrinter class that enhances console output by creating a visually distinct separator line with an accompanying title. This function utilizes the console's built-in capabilities to format and display the title in a styled manner, making it easier for users to identify different sections of output in the console.

When the rule function is called, it constructs a formatted string that combines the default title style with the provided title. The separator line is created using a default character, which is typically an equals sign (`=`), ensuring that the output is clear and visually appealing. The function then invokes the console's rule method to render this formatted string, effectively creating a visual break in the output.

The rule function is called by various other functions within the project, such as call_llm, tavily_extract, fallback_scrape, and others. These functions utilize the rule method to enhance the readability of their outputs by clearly delineating different sections of information, such as prompts, results, and error messages. This consistent use of the rule function across the project contributes to a more organized and user-friendly console interface.

**Note**: When using the rule function, ensure that the title provided is concise and relevant to the context of the output. This will help maintain clarity and improve the overall user experience when interacting with the console output.
***
### FunctionDef log(self, message, style)
**log**: The function of log is to print a styled log message to the console.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: A string representing the message to be logged.  
· style: An optional string that specifies the style to be applied to the log message.

**Code Description**: The log function is designed to output a log message to the console with optional styling. It takes two parameters: `message`, which is the text to be displayed, and `style`, which allows for customization of the message's appearance. The function utilizes the `self.console.log` method to print the message, applying the specified style if provided.

This function is called within various parts of the project to log important information, such as the evaluation results in the evaluate function and the rendered prompts in the chat_with_template function. For instance, in the evaluate function, the log method is used to print the details of each question being processed, including the ground truth answer and the model's predicted answer. This logging is crucial for tracking the evaluation process and understanding the model's performance.

The log function enhances the visibility of the application's operations by providing styled output, making it easier for developers and users to follow the flow of information and identify key events in the execution of the program.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the message parameter is a well-formed string. The style parameter should correspond to valid styling options recognized by the console logging mechanism. Proper usage of this function contributes to effective logging practices and aids in monitoring the application's behavior.

### FunctionDef print(self, message, style)
**print**: The function of print is to display a message in the console with optional styling.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: A string that contains the message to be printed to the console.
· style: An optional string that specifies the style to be applied to the printed message.

**Code Description**: The print function is a method within the RichPrinter class that facilitates the output of messages to the console. It utilizes the console's print method to display the provided message, applying any specified styling to enhance the visual presentation of the output.

The function begins by accepting two parameters: `message`, which is a string representing the content to be printed, and `style`, which is an optional parameter that allows the user to define the styling of the output (e.g., bold, italic, colored). If a style is provided, it is passed to the console's print method, which applies the desired formatting to the message before displaying it.

This print function is called in various contexts throughout the project, particularly in functions that require user feedback or logging of information. For instance, it is used in the call_llm function to print prompts and responses during interactions with the OpenAI chat completion API. Additionally, it is utilized in the tavily_extract and fallback_scrape functions to display URLs being processed and results obtained from web scraping.

The integration of the print function within these contexts ensures that important information is communicated effectively to the user, enhancing the overall usability of the application. By providing visual feedback through styled output, the print function contributes to a more engaging and informative user experience.

**Note**: When using the print function, it is important to ensure that the message is clear and concise. The optional style parameter should be used judiciously to maintain readability and avoid excessive formatting that could detract from the message's clarity.
***
### FunctionDef print_exception(self, message, max_frames)
**print_exception**: The function of print_exception is to log an error message and print the exception details to the console.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: str - The message to be logged, which contains the content to be printed to the console.  
· max_frames: int (optional) - The maximum number of stack frames to display when printing the exception, defaulting to 5.

**Code Description**: The print_exception method is a member of the RichPrinter class, designed to handle the logging and display of exception messages in a visually distinct manner. When invoked, it first calls the log method to print the provided message in bold red style, ensuring that the error is immediately noticeable to the user. This is achieved through the line `printer.log(f"{message}", style="bold red")`, which utilizes the logging capabilities of the RichPrinter class.

Following the logging of the message, the method proceeds to print the actual exception details using the console's print_exception method, with the parameter max_frames controlling how many frames of the stack trace are displayed. This allows developers to quickly identify the source of the error and understand the context in which it occurred.

The print_exception method is called in various parts of the project, notably within the critic method of the CriticAgent class and the main function of the main module. In the CriticAgent's critic method, it is used to log errors encountered during the parsing of YAML content from the model's response. If a yaml.YAMLError is raised, the print_exception method is invoked to provide clear feedback about the parsing failure, which is critical for debugging and resolving issues in the critique generation process.

Similarly, in the main function, print_exception is called when an exception occurs during the processing of user tasks. This ensures that any errors encountered during the execution of the CriticSearch pipeline are logged and communicated to the user, enhancing the application's robustness and user experience.

Overall, the print_exception method serves as an essential tool for error handling within the application, providing a consistent approach to logging and displaying exceptions. Its integration into various components of the project underscores its importance in maintaining transparency and facilitating effective debugging.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the message parameter is a well-formed string. The max_frames parameter should be set according to the desired level of detail in the stack trace output. Proper usage of this function contributes to effective logging practices and aids in the swift resolution of issues within the application.
***
### FunctionDef save_output_to_file(self, file_path)
**save_output_to_file**: The function of save_output_to_file is to save the current console output to a specified file.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· file_path: A Path object representing the location of the file where the console output will be saved. The default value is "output.txt".

**Code Description**:  
The `save_output_to_file` function is responsible for saving the current console output to a file. The function takes an optional parameter, `file_path`, which specifies the path where the output will be stored. If not provided, the output is saved to a default file named "output.txt". 

The function works as follows:
1. It opens the file at the specified `file_path` in write-text mode (`"wt"`), ensuring the file is created if it does not already exist. The file is opened with UTF-8 encoding to handle text properly.
2. A `Console` object is created, with the file (`report_file`) passed as the output stream. This step redirects the console's output to the file.
3. The function then calls the `export_text` method of the `console` object to retrieve the current console output in text format.
4. The retrieved text is written to the file using the `log` method of the `Console` object.
5. Finally, a rule (a separator) is added to the output to indicate that the file has been generated, marking the end of the saved content.

This function ensures that the console's output is properly saved to a file and that the file is marked as complete.

**Note**: 
- The function opens the file in text mode with UTF-8 encoding, so it is important to ensure the file system supports this encoding.
- The function automatically creates the file if it does not already exist, but overwrites the file if it already exists, without any prompt for user confirmation. 
- The `console.export_text()` method should be correctly populated with the desired console output for accurate results.
