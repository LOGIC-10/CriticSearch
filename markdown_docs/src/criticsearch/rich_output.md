## ClassDef RichPrinter
**RichPrinter**: The function of RichPrinter is to provide a set of methods for printing styled messages, handling exception printing, and saving console output to a file.

**attributes**:
· console: Console  
· default_title_style: str  
· default_line_characters: str  

**Code Description**:  
The `RichPrinter` class is designed to work with the `Console` class, most likely from the `rich` library, to enable styled and formatted output to the terminal. The class also includes features for printing exceptions and saving console output to a file.

- **console**: This attribute stores an instance of the `Console` class. If no `Console` instance is provided during the initialization of `RichPrinter`, a new `Console` instance is created with `record=True`. The `record` parameter indicates that the console should capture the output for later use or export.
  
- **default_title_style**: This string attribute sets the default style for titles printed using the `rule` method. The default style is `[cyan bold]`, which means titles will appear in cyan and bold when printed.
  
- **default_line_characters**: This attribute defines the default character used to create a line or separator in printed rules. By default, the character is the equal sign (`=`).

The class provides the following methods:

1. **__init__(self, console: Console = None)**:  
   The constructor method initializes the `RichPrinter` object. If a `Console` object is passed as a parameter, it uses that; otherwise, it creates a new `Console` instance with the `record` set to `True`.

2. **rule(self, title: str)**:  
   This method prints a decorative rule (a line) with a title. The title is printed with the default title style (`[cyan bold]`), and the line separating the title is formed using the default line characters (`=`). It calls the `console.rule` method to render the rule.

3. **log(self, message: str, style: str = None)**:  
   This method prints a log message using the `console.log` method. The message is printed with an optional style, which defaults to `None` if no style is provided.

4. **print(self, message: str, style: str = None)**:  
   Similar to the `log` method, this method prints a regular message to the console using the `console.print` method. Again, the message can be styled by passing an optional `style` argument.

5. **print_exception(self, message: str, max_frames: int = 5)**:  
   This method prints an exception message with a bold red style using the `console.print_exception` method. It also allows controlling the number of stack frames shown when printing the exception, defaulting to 5 frames. Before printing the exception, it uses the `log` method to display the exception message in red, bold.

6. **save_output_to_file(self, file_path: Path = Path("output.txt"))**:  
   This method saves the output of the `Console` object to a specified file. It creates a new `Console` instance that writes to the file. It exports the current text output captured by the original console and saves it to the given file path. The method ensures that a rule is added at the end of the file to mark that the output has been successfully written.

**Note**:  
- The `save_output_to_file` method exports the content of the console as plain text. It is important to ensure that the file path provided is accessible and writable.  
- The default behavior of printing to the console and exporting to a file is meant to be flexible, allowing users to either view the output directly or save it for later inspection.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, console)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the instance of the `RichPrinter` class and configure its attributes, including setting up a default `Console` instance and assigning default styles for the title and line separator.

**parameters**: 
· console: Optional. An instance of the `Console` class. If not provided, a new `Console` object will be created.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` function is the constructor method of the `RichPrinter` class. It initializes the object with two main responsibilities:
1. It accepts an optional `console` parameter, which is an instance of the `Console` class. If no `console` is passed to the constructor, it defaults to creating a new `Console` instance with the `record=True` parameter, enabling the recording of the output.
2. It sets up default style and formatting attributes:
   - `default_title_style`: This is set to "[cyan bold]", defining the default style for titles to be cyan and bold.
   - `default_line_characters`: This is set to `"="`, which specifies that the default character for line separators will be the equals sign (`=`).

This constructor ensures that the `RichPrinter` class has the necessary setup for its output, including the ability to log or record the output and use consistent styling for its visual presentation.

**Note**: If a custom `Console` instance is passed, it will be used instead of the default one. Additionally, the default style settings can be overridden later in the class, but they serve as initial values for title and line separator styling.
***
### FunctionDef rule(self, title)
**rule**: The function of rule is to create a visual separator in the console output with a specified title.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· title: A string that represents the title to be displayed in the rule.

**Code Description**: The rule function is a method of the RichPrinter class that utilizes the console's built-in functionality to generate a visually distinct horizontal line in the console output. This line serves as a separator, enhancing the readability of the output by clearly delineating different sections or important information.

When the rule function is called, it takes a single parameter, title, which is a string. This title is formatted using a default style defined within the class, specifically `self.default_title_style`. The function then calls `self.console.rule`, passing the formatted title along with a character to be used for the line. By default, this character is set to `=`.

The rule function is invoked in several places within the project, particularly in the context of logging and displaying important stages or outputs during the execution of various workflows. For instance, it is called in the `call_llm`, `tavily_extract`, and `fallback_scrape` functions, among others. In these instances, the rule function is used to create headers for sections of output, such as "LLM Prompt", "Tavily Extract URLs", and "Fallback Scrape Results". This consistent use of the rule function helps maintain a structured and organized output format, making it easier for users to follow the flow of information.

**Note**: When using the rule function, ensure that the title provided is concise and relevant to the content that follows. This will maximize the effectiveness of the visual separator in enhancing the clarity of the console output.
***
### FunctionDef log(self, message, style)
**log**: The function of log is to print a styled log message to the console.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: str - The message to be logged, which contains the content to be printed to the console.  
· style: str (optional) - An optional parameter that specifies the style in which the message should be printed.

**Code Description**: The log function is a method within the RichPrinter class that is designed to output log messages to the console with optional styling. The function takes two parameters: `message`, which is a string containing the content to be logged, and `style`, which is an optional string that defines the visual style of the output.

When invoked, the log function calls `self.console.log(message, style=style)`, which utilizes the console's logging capabilities to print the message. The `style` parameter allows for customization of the message's appearance, enabling developers to highlight important information or differentiate between various types of log messages through color or formatting.

The log function is called within various contexts in the project, notably in the `evaluate` function found in the abs_exp_1.py file. In this context, the log function is used to print formatted messages that indicate the current question being evaluated, the ground truth answer, and the model's predicted answer. This logging is crucial for tracking the evaluation process and understanding the performance of the model during assessments.

Additionally, the log function is utilized in other parts of the project, such as within the `chat_with_template` function, where it logs the full rendered prompt when the `check_prompt` parameter is set to True. This feature aids in debugging by providing visibility into the prompts sent to the conversational model.

Overall, the log function serves as an essential tool for maintaining transparency in the application's operations, allowing developers to monitor the flow of execution and capture important events or errors during runtime.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `message` parameter is a well-formed string. The `style` parameter should be used judiciously to enhance readability without overwhelming the console output. Proper usage of this function contributes to effective logging practices within the application.

### FunctionDef print(self, message, style)
**print**: The function of print is to display a message to the console with an optional style.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: A string that contains the message to be printed.
· style: An optional string that specifies the style in which the message should be printed.

**Code Description**: The print function is a method of the RichPrinter class, which is responsible for outputting messages to the console in a formatted manner. It takes two parameters: `message`, which is a string that represents the content to be displayed, and `style`, which is an optional parameter that allows the user to specify how the message should appear (for example, in bold or a specific color).

Internally, the function utilizes the `self.console.print()` method to render the message on the console. This method is part of the Rich library, which provides advanced formatting options for terminal output. If a style is provided, it is applied to the message, enhancing its visibility or aesthetic appeal.

The print function is called in various parts of the codebase, particularly within the `call_llm`, `tavily_extract`, `fallback_scrape`, and other functions in the `src/criticsearch/abstract_substitution/abs_exp_1.py` file. For instance, in the `call_llm` function, the print method is used to display the prompt sent to the language model and the raw output received from it. This helps in debugging and understanding the flow of data through the application.

In the context of the overall application, the print function serves as a crucial tool for logging and displaying information to the user, making it easier to track the progress of operations and the results of various tasks.

**Note**: When using the print function, it is essential to ensure that the message is properly formatted and that the style, if used, is valid according to the Rich library's styling options. This will ensure that the output is both informative and visually appealing.
***
### FunctionDef print_exception(self, message, max_frames)
**print_exception**: The function of print_exception is to log an error message and print the exception details to the console.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: str - The message to be logged, which contains the content to be printed to the console.  
· max_frames: int (optional) - The maximum number of stack frames to display when printing the exception, defaulting to 5.

**Code Description**: The print_exception method is a member of the RichPrinter class, designed to handle the logging and display of exception messages in a formatted manner. When invoked, it first calls the log method to print the provided message in bold red style, which serves to highlight the error and draw attention to it. This is particularly useful for debugging and monitoring purposes, as it allows developers to quickly identify issues within the application.

Following the logging of the message, the method utilizes the console's print_exception functionality to display the exception details. The max_frames parameter controls how many frames of the stack trace are shown, allowing for a concise view of the error context without overwhelming the console output. By default, it limits the display to five frames, which is typically sufficient for diagnosing most issues.

The print_exception method is called in various contexts throughout the project, notably within the critic method of the CriticAgent class. In this context, it is used to log an error when the extraction and validation of YAML content from the model's response fails. This ensures that any issues encountered during the critique generation process are communicated clearly, allowing developers to address them promptly.

Additionally, the print_exception method is invoked in the main function of the project when an exception occurs during the execution of the process_single_task function. This provides a mechanism for gracefully handling errors at the top level of the application, ensuring that users receive informative feedback when something goes wrong.

The method is also referenced in the write method of the ConversationManager class, where it logs errors encountered during file writing operations. This consistent usage of print_exception across different parts of the codebase contributes to a robust error handling strategy, enhancing the overall reliability of the application.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the message parameter is a well-formed string. The max_frames parameter should be set according to the desired level of detail in the stack trace. Proper usage of this function aids in effective logging and debugging practices within the application.
***
### FunctionDef save_output_to_file(self, file_path)
**save_output_to_file**: The function of save_output_to_file is to save the current console output to a specified file.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· file_path: A Path object representing the location of the file where the console output will be saved. The default value is "output.txt".

**Code Description**:  
The `save_output_to_file` function is responsible for saving the current console output to a file. The function takes an optional parameter, `file_path`, which specifies the path where the output will be stored. If not provided, the output is saved to a default file named "output.txt". 

The function works as follows:
1. It opens the file at the specified `file_path` in write-text mode (`"wt"`), ensuring the file is created if it does not already exist. The file is opened with UTF-8 encoding to handle text properly.
2. A `Console` object is created, with the file (`report_file`) passed as the output stream. This step redirects the console's output to the file.
3. The function then calls the `export_text` method of the `console` object to retrieve the current console output in text format.
4. The retrieved text is written to the file using the `log` method of the `Console` object.
5. Finally, a rule (a separator) is added to the output to indicate that the file has been generated, marking the end of the saved content.

This function ensures that the console's output is properly saved to a file and that the file is marked as complete.

**Note**: 
- The function opens the file in text mode with UTF-8 encoding, so it is important to ensure the file system supports this encoding.
- The function automatically creates the file if it does not already exist, but overwrites the file if it already exists, without any prompt for user confirmation. 
- The `console.export_text()` method should be correctly populated with the desired console output for accurate results.
