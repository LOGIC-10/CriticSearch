## ClassDef InterceptHandler
**InterceptHandler**: The function of InterceptHandler is to redirect standard logging messages to the Loguru logging system, allowing for consistent log handling across the application.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· record: logging.LogRecord - This parameter represents the log record containing all the information pertinent to the event being logged.

**Code Description**: The InterceptHandler class extends the logging.Handler class to facilitate the integration of Python's standard logging module with the Loguru logging system. The primary function of this class is to override the emit method, which is responsible for processing log records. 

When a log record is emitted, the emit method first attempts to map the standard logging level (record.levelname) to the corresponding Loguru level using the logger.level method. If the level cannot be found, it defaults to using the numeric level (record.levelno). 

Next, the method identifies the caller of the log message by traversing the call stack using inspect.currentframe(). This is done to determine the depth of the call, which helps in providing context for the log message. The depth is incremented until it reaches a frame that is not part of the logging module itself.

Finally, the log message is logged using Loguru's logger.opt method, which allows for additional options such as depth and exception information to be included. This ensures that the log message is formatted and handled according to Loguru's capabilities, providing a more powerful logging experience.

The InterceptHandler is utilized within the set_logger_level_from_config function, which configures the Loguru logger based on the specified log level. This function removes any existing Loguru handlers, sets up new handlers for different log levels, and ultimately redirects standard logging output to the Loguru system using the InterceptHandler. This integration allows all logging, whether from standard logging or Loguru, to be managed uniformly, enhancing the application's logging consistency and effectiveness.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the InterceptHandler is properly instantiated and passed to the logging.basicConfig function to effectively redirect standard logging output to Loguru. Additionally, users should be aware of the log levels being set and how they correspond to Loguru's logging levels to avoid any confusion in log output.
### FunctionDef emit(self, record)
**emit**: The function of emit is to process and log a message using the Loguru logger while capturing the log level and caller information.

**parameters**: 
- record: logging.LogRecord - This parameter holds the log record containing information about the event being logged, such as the log level, message, and associated exception information.

**Code Description**: 
The `emit` function processes the incoming log record and logs the message using the Loguru logger. The function first attempts to map the standard Python logging log level to a corresponding Loguru log level. If the log level is not recognized, it falls back to using the numeric level value.

The code then inspects the call stack to determine the caller information that originated the log message. This is achieved by traversing the call stack with the help of the `inspect.currentframe()` method. The function skips frames that belong to the `logging` module, focusing on the caller that generated the log message.

Finally, the function uses Loguru’s `opt()` method to adjust the depth (indicating the call stack level) and exception information before logging the message with the appropriate level. The log message is retrieved from the `record` object using `record.getMessage()`.

**Note**: 
- The `logger.level(record.levelname).name` method is used to map the standard logging levels (such as 'INFO', 'ERROR') to the corresponding Loguru levels. If a matching level cannot be found, the function uses the `record.levelno` numeric value to log the message.
- The `inspect.currentframe()` method is used to inspect the current stack trace. The `depth` parameter ensures the correct caller's frame is identified, avoiding frames related to the logging module itself.
- The `logger.opt(depth=depth, exception=record.exc_info).log(level, record.getMessage())` is responsible for sending the log message to Loguru with additional contextual information like depth and exception details.

## FunctionDef set_logger_level_from_config(log_level)
## Function: `set_logger_level_from_config`

### Description:
The `set_logger_level_from_config` function configures the logging behavior for the application by setting up the **Loguru** logger with the specified log level. It also integrates **Loguru** with Python's standard logging module to ensure consistent logging across the application.

### Arguments:
- `log_level` (str): A string representing the desired log level for **Loguru** (e.g., `"DEBUG"`, `"INFO"`, `"WARNING"`). The function will configure the logger to output logs at this level.

### Functionality:
- **Loguru Logger Configuration**: 
  - The function first removes any existing handlers from **Loguru** to ensure that the logger starts with a clean configuration.
  - It then adds a new handler that directs log output to **stderr** and configures the log level based on the provided `log_level`.
  - Additional parameters:
    - `enqueue=True`: Ensures that logs are handled in a thread-safe manner using a queue.
    - `backtrace=False`: Disables detailed tracebacks to prevent excessively verbose logs.
    - `diagnose=False`: Suppresses extra diagnostic information from **Loguru** to keep the logs concise.
    - `filter=lambda record: record["level"].name != "SUCCESS"`: Filters out logs with the `"SUCCESS"` level from this handler.

- **Success Log Format**: 
  - A specific format for `"SUCCESS"` level logs is defined, which includes:
    - A timestamp (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS`),
    - Log level,
    - Module, function, and line number from where the log was generated,
    - The log message itself.

- **Handling `"SUCCESS"` Logs**: 
  - A separate handler is added for **Loguru** to handle logs at the `"SUCCESS"` level, ensuring that they follow the defined success log format.

- **File-based Logging**:
  - A file handler is added that writes logs to a file (`output.txt`) with the specified `log_level`.
  - This file logging does not split logs into multiple files (i.e., no rotation) and does not retain old logs.

- **Standard Logging Integration**:
  - The function uses the `InterceptHandler` class to intercept logs from Python's standard logging module and redirect them to **Loguru**. This ensures that both **Loguru** and standard logging are handled consistently.

- **Log Message**: 
  - Once the logger is configured, a success message is logged using the `"SUCCESS"` level, indicating the log level that has been set.

### Example Usage:
```python
set_logger_level_from_config(log_level="INFO")
```

This would configure **Loguru** to output logs at the `"INFO"` level and redirect standard logging messages to **Loguru** as well.
## FunctionDef colorize_message(message_title, color, style, message_content)
**colorize_message**: The function of colorize_message is to format and log messages with specified colors and styles for better visibility in the output.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message_title: An optional string that serves as the title of the message to be logged. Default is an empty string.
· color: A literal string that specifies the color of the message. It can be one of the following values: "black", "blue", "cyan", "green", "magenta", "red", "white", or "yellow". Default is "black".
· style: A literal string that defines the style of the message. It can be "bold", "dim", "normal", "italic", or "underline". Default is "normal".
· message_content: An optional parameter that can either be a string or a dictionary. It contains the content of the message to be logged. Default is an empty string.

**Code Description**: The colorize_message function is designed to enhance the logging experience by allowing developers to specify both the color and style of the messages being logged. The function begins by determining the appropriate opening tags for the specified color and style. If both are provided, it generates a closing tag accordingly. 

The function then constructs a styled title using the provided message_title, surrounded by equal signs for visual emphasis. If message_content is a dictionary, it formats it as a JSON string for better readability; otherwise, it converts it to a string. Finally, the function logs the formatted message using the logger's success method, ensuring that the title and content are displayed clearly.

This function is called multiple times within the main function of the project, specifically during the iterative process of handling tasks. It is used to log significant events such as the start of iterations, the common agent's answers, and the responses from the critic agent. By utilizing colorize_message, the output becomes more organized and visually distinct, aiding developers in tracking the flow of information and the status of various processes throughout the execution of the program.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the color and style parameters are chosen appropriately to maintain readability in the output. Additionally, the message_content should be formatted correctly to avoid any logging errors.
