## FunctionDef get_list_type_annotation(param_type)
**get_list_type_annotation**: The function of get_list_type_annotation is to determine the type of elements in a list for constructing the "items" field in a JSON Schema.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· param_type: A type annotation representing the parameter to inspect. It should typically be a generic list type like `List[str]` or `List[int]`.

**Code Description**: The `get_list_type_annotation` function is designed to extract the type of elements contained within a list. It is primarily used to help generate JSON Schema definitions, specifically for the "items" field, which describes the type of elements within an array. 

The function first checks if the provided `param_type` is a list (using the `get_origin` function to check for a generic list type). If `param_type` is indeed a list, the function proceeds to extract the type of the elements within that list by calling `get_args(param_type)`. The first argument returned by `get_args` represents the element type, and if it is a type (i.e., `isinstance(args[0], type)`), the function returns a dictionary with the element's type name (e.g., `"string"` or `"int"`) for use in a JSON Schema definition.

If the `param_type` is not a list or the element type cannot be determined, the function defaults to returning a dictionary with the value `"type": "string"`, signifying that the list elements are assumed to be of string type.

This function is called in the `create_schema_from_function` method to help construct the schema of function parameters when the function contains a parameter of list type. Specifically, within `create_schema_from_function`, when a parameter is detected to be a list, the `get_list_type_annotation` function is invoked to determine the type of the items in that list, which is then added to the parameter schema as the `"items"` field.

**Note**: It is important that the parameter passed to `get_list_type_annotation` be a valid generic list type (such as `List[str]` or `List[int]`). If the type is not a list or cannot be determined, the function will return a default type of `"string"`.

**Output Example**: 
For a `param_type` of `List[str]`, the function would return:
```json
{
  "type": "str"
}
```

For a `param_type` of `List[int]`, the function would return:
```json
{
  "type": "int"
}
```

For a `param_type` of an unsupported or non-list type, the function would return:
```json
{
  "type": "string"
}
```
## FunctionDef serialize_type(value)
**serialize_type**: The function of serialize_type is to map a given string representing a data type to its corresponding serialized name.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· value: str - A string representing a data type to be serialized.

**Code Description**:  
The `serialize_type` function takes in a string value representing a data type (e.g., "str", "int", etc.). The function performs the following steps:
1. A dictionary named `type_mapping` is defined. This dictionary contains key-value pairs where the key is a string representing a Python data type, and the value is the corresponding serialized name in a more generalized format.
   - `"str"` maps to `"string"`
   - `"int"` maps to `"integer"`
   - `"float"` maps to `"number"`
   - `"bool"` maps to `"boolean"`
   - `"list"` maps to `"array"`
   - `"dict"` maps to `"object"`
   - `"None"` maps to `"null"`
   
2. The input value is converted to lowercase to ensure that the function is case-insensitive.

3. The function attempts to find the serialized name by checking if the lowercase version of the `value` exists in the `type_mapping` dictionary.

4. If a match is found, the corresponding serialized value is returned.

5. If no match is found, the function defaults to returning `"null"`, which is the fallback value defined in the dictionary.

**Note**: 
- The function is case-insensitive due to the use of the `lower()` method on the input string.
- It assumes that the input is a valid Python type name. If the input string does not match any of the predefined keys, it returns `"null"`.
- The function can be used for serializing Python data types to a format suitable for data serialization or communication in various systems.

**Output Example**:
- For an input value of `"str"`, the function will return `"string"`.
- For an input value of `"int"`, the function will return `"integer"`.
- For an input value of `"boolean"`, the function will return `"null"` since the value does not match any of the keys in the `type_mapping` dictionary.
## ClassDef Item
**Item**: The function of Item is to represent a list item with a specific type.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· type: str - The type of the list item, which is a required field.

**Code Description**: The Item class is a subclass of BaseModel, which indicates that it is likely part of a data modeling framework that includes validation and serialization capabilities. The primary attribute of this class is `type`, which is a string that specifies the type of the list item. This attribute is defined using the Field function, which enforces that it is a required field (denoted by the ellipsis `...`). 

The class also includes a method called `serialize_type`, which is decorated with `@field_serializer`. This method is responsible for customizing the serialization of the `type` attribute. When the `type` attribute is serialized, this method is invoked, allowing for any specific transformations or formatting to be applied to the value before it is returned. The actual transformation is handled by the `serialize_type` function, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the project.

The Item class is utilized within the ParameterProperty class, where it is defined as an optional attribute named `items`. This indicates that a ParameterProperty can have a list of items, each of which is represented by an instance of the Item class. The relationship between Item and ParameterProperty is significant, as it allows for the encapsulation of item types within the broader context of parameter properties, enhancing the structure and organization of the data model.

**Note**: When using the Item class, ensure that the `type` attribute is always provided, as it is a required field. Additionally, be aware that the serialization behavior of the `type` attribute can be customized through the `serialize_type` method.

**Output Example**: An instance of the Item class might return a serialized representation like this:
```json
{
  "type": "string"
}
``` 
This output indicates that the type of the list item is a string, demonstrating how the class encapsulates and manages item type information.
### FunctionDef serialize_type(self, value, _info)
**serialize_type**: The function of serialize_type is to convert a given string value into a serialized format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: value (str) - The string input that needs to be serialized.
· parameter2: _info - An additional parameter that may contain contextual information, though it is not utilized within the function.

**Code Description**: The serialize_type function takes a string input, referred to as 'value', and passes it to another function named serialize_type. This indicates that the function is likely designed to handle serialization tasks, converting the input string into a specific serialized format. The second parameter, _info, is included in the function signature but is not used within the function body, suggesting that it may be intended for future use or for compatibility with a broader interface. The function returns the result of the serialization process, which is expected to be a string.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input 'value' is a valid string that can be serialized. The behavior of the function will depend on the implementation of the serialize_type function that it calls. Additionally, since the _info parameter is not utilized, developers should be aware that it may not affect the serialization process.

**Output Example**: If the input value is "example", the function might return a serialized representation such as "serialized_example".
***
## ClassDef ParameterProperty
**ParameterProperty**: The function of ParameterProperty is to define the properties of a parameter, including its data type, description, and optional items.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· type: str - The data type of the parameter, which is a required field.  
· description: Optional[str] - A description of the parameter, which is an optional field.  
· items: Optional[Item] - An optional attribute that represents a list of items associated with the parameter.

**Code Description**: The ParameterProperty class is a subclass of BaseModel, indicating that it is part of a data modeling framework that provides validation and serialization capabilities. The primary attribute of this class is `type`, which is a string that specifies the data type of the parameter. This attribute is defined using the Field function, which enforces that it is a required field (denoted by the ellipsis `...`). 

The `description` attribute is an optional string that provides additional information about the parameter, enhancing the understanding of its purpose and usage. The `items` attribute is also optional and is defined as an instance of the Item class, which allows for the encapsulation of item types within the context of parameter properties. This relationship is significant as it enables ParameterProperty to manage a collection of items, each represented by the Item class, thereby enhancing the structure and organization of the data model.

The ParameterProperty class is utilized within the Parameters class, where it is defined as a value in a dictionary that maps parameter names to their respective properties. This indicates that each parameter in the Parameters class can have its own set of properties defined by the ParameterProperty class. The Parameters class also includes attributes such as `required`, which specifies a list of required parameter names, and `additionalProperties`, which indicates whether additional properties are allowed.

The integration of ParameterProperty within the Parameters class allows for a comprehensive representation of parameters, including their types, descriptions, and associated items. This structured approach facilitates the management of complex parameter configurations in applications.

**Note**: When using the ParameterProperty class, ensure that the `type` attribute is always provided, as it is a required field. The `description` and `items` attributes can be included as needed to provide further context and detail about the parameter.

**Output Example**: An instance of the ParameterProperty class might return a serialized representation like this:
```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "description": "A parameter that accepts string values.",
  "items": {
    "type": "string"
  }
}
```
This output indicates that the parameter is of type string, includes a description, and has associated items, demonstrating how the class encapsulates and manages parameter property information.
### FunctionDef serialize_type(self, value, _info)
**serialize_type**: The function of serialize_type is to convert a given string value into a serialized format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: value (str) - The string input that needs to be serialized.
· parameter2: _info - Additional information that may be used during serialization, though it is not utilized in the current implementation.

**Code Description**: The serialize_type function is designed to take a string input, referred to as 'value', and pass it to another function named serialize_type for processing. The function does not perform any operations on the input itself; instead, it directly calls the serialize_type function, which is presumably defined elsewhere in the codebase. The purpose of this function is to ensure that the input string is transformed into a serialized format, which is often necessary for data storage or transmission. The second parameter, _info, is included in the function signature but is not used within the function body, indicating that it may be intended for future use or for compatibility with a specific interface.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input string is valid and that the serialize_type function being called is properly defined and accessible within the scope of this function. Additionally, the behavior of the function may depend on the implementation of the serialize_type function it calls.

**Output Example**: If the input value is "example", and the serialize_type function processes it to return a serialized version, the output might look like "serialized_example".
***
## ClassDef Parameters
**Parameters**: The function of Parameters is to define a schema for function parameters, including their properties and requirements.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· type: str - The type of the parameter object, which defaults to "object".  
· properties: Dict[str, ParameterProperty] - A dictionary where keys are parameter names and values are their properties, which is a required field.  
· required: List[str] - A list of required parameter names, which is also a required field.  
· additionalProperties: bool - A boolean indicating whether additional properties are allowed, defaulting to False.

**Code Description**: The Parameters class is a subclass of BaseModel, which indicates that it is part of a data modeling framework that provides validation and serialization capabilities. This class is designed to encapsulate the structure and requirements of parameters used in functions.

The `type` attribute specifies the nature of the parameter object and is set to "object" by default. This attribute is essential as it establishes the context for the parameters being defined.

The `properties` attribute is a dictionary that maps parameter names (as strings) to their respective properties, which are defined by the ParameterProperty class. This relationship allows for a detailed specification of each parameter's characteristics, such as its data type and description.

The `required` attribute is a list that enumerates the names of parameters that must be provided when the function is called. This ensures that any function utilizing this schema adheres to its defined requirements, promoting robustness and reducing the likelihood of errors.

The `additionalProperties` attribute indicates whether parameters not explicitly defined in the `properties` dictionary are permitted. By default, this is set to False, enforcing a strict schema that only allows the specified parameters.

The Parameters class is utilized within the Function class, where it is defined as the `parameters` attribute. This integration signifies that every function can have a well-defined set of parameters, enhancing the clarity and maintainability of the code. Additionally, the Parameters class is referenced in the `create_schema_from_function` method, which constructs a Tool schema from a target function. This method extracts function metadata, including parameter information, and organizes it into the Parameters structure, thereby facilitating the creation of a comprehensive schema for the function.

**Note**: When using the Parameters class, ensure that the `properties` and `required` attributes are always provided, as they are essential for defining the parameter schema. The `additionalProperties` attribute can be adjusted based on the desired flexibility of the parameter definitions.
## ClassDef Function
**Function**: The function of Function is to define a structured representation of a function, including its name, description, and parameters.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· name: str - The name of the function, which is a required field.  
· description: str - A description of what the function does, which is also a required field.  
· parameters: Parameters - An instance of the Parameters class that defines the schema for the function's parameters, which is a required field.  

**Code Description**: The Function class is a subclass of BaseModel, indicating its role within a data modeling framework that provides validation and serialization capabilities. This class is designed to encapsulate the essential details of a function, including its name, description, and a structured schema for its parameters.

The `name` attribute is a string that holds the name of the function. This is crucial for identifying the function within the broader context of the application or system.

The `description` attribute is a string that provides a detailed explanation of the function's purpose and behavior. This attribute is important for documentation and clarity, allowing developers to understand the function's role without needing to inspect its implementation.

The `parameters` attribute is an instance of the Parameters class, which defines the schema for the function's parameters. This integration ensures that every function represented by the Function class has a well-defined set of parameters, promoting clarity and maintainability in the code. The Parameters class specifies the types, requirements, and additional properties of the parameters, thereby enforcing a structured approach to function definitions.

The Function class is utilized within the Tool class, where it is defined as the `function` attribute. This relationship signifies that each Tool instance can encapsulate a function definition, allowing for the creation of tools that are based on specific functions. The Tool class also includes a class method, `create_schema_from_function`, which constructs a Tool schema from a target function. This method extracts metadata from the target function, including its name, description, and parameters, and organizes this information into the Function and Parameters structures. This process enhances the clarity and usability of the function definitions within the application.

**Note**: When using the Function class, ensure that all attributes (name, description, and parameters) are provided, as they are essential for defining a complete function representation. The integration with the Parameters class is critical for maintaining a structured approach to function parameter definitions.
## ClassDef Tool
**Tool**: The function of Tool is to create a structured representation of a function, encapsulating its metadata and schema.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· type: str - The type of the tool, typically set to 'function'.  
· function: Function - An instance of the Function class that defines the function's name, description, and parameters.

**Code Description**: The Tool class is a subclass of BaseModel, designed to encapsulate the details of a function within a structured schema. It includes two primary attributes: `type`, which indicates the nature of the tool (defaulting to 'function'), and `function`, which is an instance of the Function class. The Function class itself represents a structured definition of a function, including its name, description, and a schema for its parameters.

A key feature of the Tool class is the class method `create_schema_from_function`. This method takes a target function as an argument and extracts essential metadata, such as the function's name and documentation string. It parses the documentation to generate sections that include a description and a list of parameters. The method utilizes the inspect module to retrieve the function's signature, allowing it to identify required parameters and their types.

The extracted information is then organized into a Function instance, which is returned as part of the Tool instance. This process facilitates the creation of a comprehensive schema that can be used to represent the function in a structured manner.

The Tool class is utilized within the ToolRegistry's `get_or_create_tool_schema` method. This method retrieves or creates tool schemas for specified functions. If a function's schema is not already registered, it invokes `Tool.create_schema_from_function` to generate the schema and add it to the registry. This integration ensures that function definitions are consistently represented and easily accessible within the application.

**Note**: When using the Tool class, ensure that the `function` attribute is properly defined as an instance of the Function class, as this is critical for maintaining a structured representation of the function's metadata.

A possible appearance of the code's return value when invoking `Tool.create_schema_from_function` might look like this:
```json

                    "description": "The first parameter."
                },
                "param2": {
                    "type": "str",
                    "description": "The second parameter."
                }
            },
            "required": ["param1"],
            "additionalProperties": false
        }
    }
}
```
### FunctionDef create_schema_from_function(cls, target_function)
### `create_schema_from_function`

#### Overview

The `create_schema_from_function` method is a class method designed to generate a schema for a tool based on a target function. This schema includes the function's name, description, and parameters, providing a structured format for the tool. The method processes the function's docstring to extract relevant information and constructs a JSON-like schema, which can be used for further automation or documentation purposes.

#### Parameters
- **cls** (`type`): The class that is calling the method. This is implicitly passed when the method is invoked.
- **target_function** (`function`): The function from which the schema will be created. The method inspects the function's name, docstring, and parameters to build the schema.

#### Method Description

1. **Extracting Function Metadata**: 
   - The method starts by extracting the function's name and docstring using the `__name__` attribute and `inspect.getdoc()`, respectively.
   - If the docstring is empty, a default message of "No description provided." is used.

2. **Parsing the Docstring**: 
   - The docstring is parsed using the `Docstring` class, which is assumed to support Google-style docstrings.
   - Sections of the docstring are identified and classified into text and parameters sections.

3. **Processing the Parameters**: 
   - The method iterates through the parsed sections to extract the description of the function and its parameters.
   - It then inspects the function's signature using the `inspect.signature()` method to identify the types, default values, and required status of each parameter.
   - Parameters are classified into required and optional based on whether they have default values or not.

4. **Building the Schema**: 
   - A `Function` schema is constructed using the extracted information. The function's parameters are detailed in the schema with their types and descriptions. If any parameter is of list type, the `get_list_type_annotation` function is used to determine the type of elements in the list.
   - The `Parameters` class is utilized to define the structure of the parameters, including their types, descriptions, required status, and whether additional properties are allowed.

5. **Returning the Schema**: 
   - Finally, the schema is returned as a serialized model, excluding any `None` values.

#### Return Value
The method returns a serialized model of the function schema, including:
- **name**: The name of the function.
- **description**: The description extracted from the function's docstring.
- **parameters**: A structured schema of the function's parameters, which includes their names, types, descriptions, and required status.

#### Example

Assume a function `example_function` with the following signature:

```python
def example_function(arg1: int, arg2: List[str] = []):
    """
    Example function to demonstrate schema creation.

    Args:
        arg1 (int): The first argument.
        arg2 (List[str], optional): The second argument, which is a list of strings.
    """
    pass
```

The `create_schema_from_function` method would generate a schema with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "example_function",
    "description": "Example function to demonstrate schema creation.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "arg1": {
          "type": "int",
          "description": "The first argument."
        },
        "arg2": {
          "type": "list",
          "items": {
            "type": "str"
          },
          "description": "The second argument, which is a list of strings."
        }
      },
      "required": ["arg1"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Notes
- The method currently supports Google-style docstrings and expects parameters to be described in a specific format within the docstring.
- It relies on the `get_list_type_annotation` function to determine the type of elements in list-type parameters.
- The `Parameters` class is used to define the structure of the parameters, ensuring a consistent schema for function input validation.

## FunctionDef get_delivery_date(order_id, delivery_type)
**get_delivery_date**: The function of get_delivery_date is to retrieve the delivery date for a customer's order based on the provided order ID and delivery type.

**parameters**: The parameters of this function:
· order_id (str): A string representing the unique ID of the order for which the delivery date is being requested.
· delivery_type (str): A string specifying the type of delivery (e.g., "standard" or "express"). The default value is "standard".

**Code Description**: 
The `get_delivery_date` function is designed to fetch the delivery date associated with a given customer order. It accepts two parameters:
1. `order_id` (str): This is a required parameter, which uniquely identifies the order whose delivery date is to be determined. 
2. `delivery_type` (str): This is an optional parameter that defines the delivery method for the order. The default value is "standard", but other types such as "express" could also be provided. The specific functionality regarding how the delivery type impacts the retrieval of the delivery date is not yet implemented, as the function currently has no logic inside it.

As the function is currently not implemented (indicated by the `pass` statement), no actions are taken within it, and it does not return any values at the moment.

**Note**: 
- This function currently does not contain any operational logic or return values, meaning it needs to be implemented with appropriate business logic to fetch the delivery date based on the order ID and delivery type.
- The function signature suggests that it will likely interact with a system (e.g., a database or API) to determine the delivery date based on the provided inputs, but this functionality is not present in the current state.
