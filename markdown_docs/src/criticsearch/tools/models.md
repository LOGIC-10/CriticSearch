## FunctionDef get_list_type_annotation(param_type)
**get_list_type_annotation**: The function of get_list_type_annotation is to determine the type of elements in a list for constructing the "items" field in a JSON Schema.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· param_type: A type annotation representing the parameter to inspect. It should typically be a generic list type like `List[str]` or `List[int]`.

**Code Description**: The `get_list_type_annotation` function is designed to extract the type of elements contained within a list. It is primarily used to help generate JSON Schema definitions, specifically for the "items" field, which describes the type of elements within an array. 

The function first checks if the provided `param_type` is a list (using the `get_origin` function to check for a generic list type). If `param_type` is indeed a list, the function proceeds to extract the type of the elements within that list by calling `get_args(param_type)`. The first argument returned by `get_args` represents the element type, and if it is a type (i.e., `isinstance(args[0], type)`), the function returns a dictionary with the element's type name (e.g., `"string"` or `"int"`) for use in a JSON Schema definition.

If the `param_type` is not a list or the element type cannot be determined, the function defaults to returning a dictionary with the value `"type": "string"`, signifying that the list elements are assumed to be of string type.

This function is called in the `create_schema_from_function` method to help construct the schema of function parameters when the function contains a parameter of list type. Specifically, within `create_schema_from_function`, when a parameter is detected to be a list, the `get_list_type_annotation` function is invoked to determine the type of the items in that list, which is then added to the parameter schema as the `"items"` field.

**Note**: It is important that the parameter passed to `get_list_type_annotation` be a valid generic list type (such as `List[str]` or `List[int]`). If the type is not a list or cannot be determined, the function will return a default type of `"string"`.

**Output Example**: 
For a `param_type` of `List[str]`, the function would return:
```json
{
  "type": "str"
}
```

For a `param_type` of `List[int]`, the function would return:
```json
{
  "type": "int"
}
```

For a `param_type` of an unsupported or non-list type, the function would return:
```json
{
  "type": "string"
}
```
## FunctionDef serialize_type(value)
**serialize_type**: The function of serialize_type is to map a given string representing a data type to its corresponding serialized name.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· value: str - A string representing a data type to be serialized.

**Code Description**:  
The `serialize_type` function takes in a string value representing a data type (e.g., "str", "int", etc.). The function performs the following steps:
1. A dictionary named `type_mapping` is defined. This dictionary contains key-value pairs where the key is a string representing a Python data type, and the value is the corresponding serialized name in a more generalized format.
   - `"str"` maps to `"string"`
   - `"int"` maps to `"integer"`
   - `"float"` maps to `"number"`
   - `"bool"` maps to `"boolean"`
   - `"list"` maps to `"array"`
   - `"dict"` maps to `"object"`
   - `"None"` maps to `"null"`
   
2. The input value is converted to lowercase to ensure that the function is case-insensitive.

3. The function attempts to find the serialized name by checking if the lowercase version of the `value` exists in the `type_mapping` dictionary.

4. If a match is found, the corresponding serialized value is returned.

5. If no match is found, the function defaults to returning `"null"`, which is the fallback value defined in the dictionary.

**Note**: 
- The function is case-insensitive due to the use of the `lower()` method on the input string.
- It assumes that the input is a valid Python type name. If the input string does not match any of the predefined keys, it returns `"null"`.
- The function can be used for serializing Python data types to a format suitable for data serialization or communication in various systems.

**Output Example**:
- For an input value of `"str"`, the function will return `"string"`.
- For an input value of `"int"`, the function will return `"integer"`.
- For an input value of `"boolean"`, the function will return `"null"` since the value does not match any of the keys in the `type_mapping` dictionary.
## ClassDef Item
**Item**: The function of Item is to represent a list item with a specific type.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· type: str - The type of the list item, which is a required field.

**Code Description**: The Item class is a subclass of BaseModel, which indicates that it is likely part of a data modeling framework that includes validation and serialization capabilities. The primary attribute of this class is `type`, which is a string that specifies the type of the list item. This attribute is defined using the Field function, which enforces that it is a required field (denoted by the ellipsis `...`). 

The class also includes a method called `serialize_type`, which is decorated with `@field_serializer`. This method is responsible for customizing the serialization of the `type` attribute. When the `type` attribute is serialized, this method is invoked, allowing for any specific transformations or formatting to be applied to the value before it is returned. The actual transformation is handled by the `serialize_type` function, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the project.

The Item class is utilized within the ParameterProperty class, where it is defined as an optional attribute named `items`. This indicates that a ParameterProperty can have a list of items, each of which is represented by an instance of the Item class. The relationship between Item and ParameterProperty is significant, as it allows for the encapsulation of item types within the broader context of parameter properties, enhancing the structure and organization of the data model.

**Note**: When using the Item class, ensure that the `type` attribute is always provided, as it is a required field. Additionally, be aware that the serialization behavior of the `type` attribute can be customized through the `serialize_type` method.

**Output Example**: An instance of the Item class might return a serialized representation like this:
```json
{
  "type": "string"
}
``` 
This output indicates that the type of the list item is a string, demonstrating how the class encapsulates and manages item type information.
### FunctionDef serialize_type(self, value, _info)
**serialize_type**: The function of serialize_type is to convert a given string value into a serialized format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: value (str) - The string input that needs to be serialized.
· parameter2: _info - An additional parameter that may contain contextual information, though it is not utilized within the function.

**Code Description**: The serialize_type function takes a string input, referred to as 'value', and passes it to another function named serialize_type. This indicates that the function is likely designed to handle serialization tasks, converting the input string into a specific serialized format. The second parameter, _info, is included in the function signature but is not used within the function body, suggesting that it may be intended for future use or for compatibility with a broader interface. The function returns the result of the serialization process, which is expected to be a string.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input 'value' is a valid string that can be serialized. The behavior of the function will depend on the implementation of the serialize_type function that it calls. Additionally, since the _info parameter is not utilized, developers should be aware that it may not affect the serialization process.

**Output Example**: If the input value is "example", the function might return a serialized representation such as "serialized_example".
***
## ClassDef ParameterProperty
**ParameterProperty**: The function of ParameterProperty is to define the properties of a parameter, including its data type, description, and optional items.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· type: str - The data type of the parameter, which is a required field.  
· description: Optional[str] - A description of the parameter, which is an optional field.  
· items: Optional[Item] - An optional attribute that represents a list of items associated with the parameter.

**Code Description**: The ParameterProperty class is a subclass of BaseModel, indicating that it is part of a data modeling framework that provides validation and serialization capabilities. The primary attribute of this class is `type`, which is a string that specifies the data type of the parameter. This attribute is defined using the Field function, which enforces that it is a required field (denoted by the ellipsis `...`). 

The `description` attribute is an optional string that provides additional information about the parameter, enhancing the understanding of its purpose and usage. The `items` attribute is also optional and is defined as an instance of the Item class, which allows for the encapsulation of item types within the context of parameter properties. This relationship is significant as it enables ParameterProperty to manage a collection of items, each represented by the Item class, thereby enhancing the structure and organization of the data model.

The ParameterProperty class is utilized within the Parameters class, where it is defined as a value in a dictionary that maps parameter names to their respective properties. This indicates that each parameter in the Parameters class can have its own set of properties defined by the ParameterProperty class. The Parameters class also includes attributes such as `required`, which specifies a list of required parameter names, and `additionalProperties`, which indicates whether additional properties are allowed.

The integration of ParameterProperty within the Parameters class allows for a comprehensive representation of parameters, including their types, descriptions, and associated items. This structured approach facilitates the management of complex parameter configurations in applications.

**Note**: When using the ParameterProperty class, ensure that the `type` attribute is always provided, as it is a required field. The `description` and `items` attributes can be included as needed to provide further context and detail about the parameter.

**Output Example**: An instance of the ParameterProperty class might return a serialized representation like this:
```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "description": "A parameter that accepts string values.",
  "items": {
    "type": "string"
  }
}
```
This output indicates that the parameter is of type string, includes a description, and has associated items, demonstrating how the class encapsulates and manages parameter property information.
### FunctionDef serialize_type(self, value, _info)
**serialize_type**: The function of serialize_type is to convert a given string value into a serialized format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: value (str) - The string input that needs to be serialized.
· parameter2: _info - Additional information that may be used during serialization, though it is not utilized in the current implementation.

**Code Description**: The serialize_type function is designed to take a string input, referred to as 'value', and pass it to another function named serialize_type for processing. The function does not perform any operations on the input itself; instead, it directly calls the serialize_type function, which is presumably defined elsewhere in the codebase. The purpose of this function is to ensure that the input string is transformed into a serialized format, which is often necessary for data storage or transmission. The second parameter, _info, is included in the function signature but is not used within the function body, indicating that it may be intended for future use or for compatibility with a specific interface.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input string is valid and that the serialize_type function being called is properly defined and accessible within the scope of this function. Additionally, the behavior of the function may depend on the implementation of the serialize_type function it calls.

**Output Example**: If the input value is "example", and the serialize_type function processes it to return a serialized version, the output might look like "serialized_example".

### FunctionDef create_schema_from_function(cls, target_function)
### `create_schema_from_function` Method Documentation

#### Overview
The `create_schema_from_function` method is designed to generate a schema for a function, which includes the function's name, description, and parameters. It extracts this information from the provided target function and returns it in a structured format suitable for use in a tool schema.

#### Parameters
- `cls` (Type): The class that calls this method. Typically, it would be a subclass of a model class.
- `target_function` (Function): The function for which the schema is being created. The method inspects the function's name, docstring, and parameters.

#### Returns
- Returns a dictionary representing the function schema. This schema includes the function's name, description, and parameters, formatted as per the JSON Schema standard.

#### Method Behavior
1. **Extract Function Name and Docstring:**
   The method first extracts the name of the target function using `target_function.__name__`. It also retrieves the docstring associated with the function using `inspect.getdoc(target_function)`. If no docstring is provided, a default message "No description provided." is used.

2. **Parse the Docstring:**
   The docstring is parsed using the `Docstring` class, specifically following the Google-style format. The parsed sections are analyzed to extract textual descriptions and parameters. The method supports Google-style docstrings and divides the docstring into sections such as text (for description) and parameters.

3. **Extract Description and Parameters:**
   - **Description:** The method extracts the general description from the docstring.
   - **Parameters:** The method gathers information on each parameter defined in the function's signature by examining the parsed sections and the docstring.

4. **Inspect Function Signature:**
   The function signature is inspected using the `inspect.signature(target_function)`, which allows the method to extract details about each parameter. The method checks if each parameter has a default value and whether it is required or optional.

5. **Build Schema for Parameters:**
   - For each parameter, the method determines its type (either from the function signature or from the docstring).
   - It identifies whether a parameter is required or optional based on the presence of a default value.
   - If the parameter is of a list type, the method calls `get_list_type_annotation()` to determine the type of items in the list.

6. **Build the Final Schema:**
   After processing the function’s name, description, and parameters, the method constructs a final schema using the `Function` and `Parameters` classes. The schema includes:
   - **Name:** The function's name.
   - **Description:** The function's description extracted from the docstring.
   - **Parameters:** A detailed list of parameters, including their types, descriptions, and required status.

7. **Return Schema:**
   The function schema is returned as a model, with `exclude_none=True` ensuring that any optional attributes with `None` values are omitted from the final output.

#### Example Usage

```python
from some_module import Tool

def example_function(param1: str, param2: int = 10, param3: List[str] = None):
    """
    This is an example function.

    Args:
        param1 (str): A required string parameter.
        param2 (int, optional): An optional integer parameter. Defaults to 10.
        param3 (List[str], optional): A list of strings. Defaults to an empty list.

    Returns:
        str: A sample return value.
    """
    return str(param1)

# Create schema from the example function
schema = Tool.create_schema_from_function(example_function)
```

In this example, the `create_schema_from_function` method processes the `example_function` to generate a schema that includes the function's name, description, and parameter details.

#### Notes
- The method currently supports only Google-style docstrings. If the docstring format differs, it may not parse correctly.
- The function also processes the parameter type annotations, extracting and formatting them to conform to the JSON Schema specification. For list-type parameters, it uses the helper function `get_list_type_annotation()` to determine the type of items in the list.
- The generated schema is returned in a format that can be used directly for tool integration or validation.

## FunctionDef get_delivery_date(order_id, delivery_type)
**get_delivery_date**: The function of get_delivery_date is to retrieve the delivery date for a customer's order based on the provided order ID and delivery type.

**parameters**: The parameters of this function:
· order_id (str): A string representing the unique ID of the order for which the delivery date is being requested.
· delivery_type (str): A string specifying the type of delivery (e.g., "standard" or "express"). The default value is "standard".

**Code Description**: 
The `get_delivery_date` function is designed to fetch the delivery date associated with a given customer order. It accepts two parameters:
1. `order_id` (str): This is a required parameter, which uniquely identifies the order whose delivery date is to be determined. 
2. `delivery_type` (str): This is an optional parameter that defines the delivery method for the order. The default value is "standard", but other types such as "express" could also be provided. The specific functionality regarding how the delivery type impacts the retrieval of the delivery date is not yet implemented, as the function currently has no logic inside it.

As the function is currently not implemented (indicated by the `pass` statement), no actions are taken within it, and it does not return any values at the moment.

**Note**: 
- This function currently does not contain any operational logic or return values, meaning it needs to be implemented with appropriate business logic to fetch the delivery date based on the order ID and delivery type.
- The function signature suggests that it will likely interact with a system (e.g., a database or API) to determine the delivery date based on the provided inputs, but this functionality is not present in the current state.
