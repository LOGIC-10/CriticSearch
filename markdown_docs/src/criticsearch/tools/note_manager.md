## FunctionDef set_session(session_id)
**set_session**: The function of set_session is to set the current session's session_id.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· session_id: A string representing the unique identifier for the current session.

**Code Description**: The set_session function is designed to set the session identifier for the current context of the application. It takes a single parameter, session_id, which is expected to be a string. The function utilizes a thread-local storage mechanism, indicated by the use of `_current_session_id.set(session_id)`, to ensure that the session_id is stored in a way that is unique to the current thread of execution. This is particularly useful in multi-threaded environments where different threads may handle different user sessions concurrently.

The set_session function is called within the constructor of the WorkflowExecutor class in the workflow.py file. During the initialization of a WorkflowExecutor instance, a unique session_id is generated using `uuid.uuid4()`, which provides a universally unique identifier. This session_id is then passed to the set_session function to establish the current session context. This integration ensures that all subsequent operations within the WorkflowExecutor instance can reference the correct session, facilitating the organization and retrieval of notes and other session-specific data.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the session_id provided to the set_session function is valid and unique for each session to prevent any potential conflicts or data integrity issues within the application.
## FunctionDef _taking_notes(session_id, note)
**_taking_notes**: The function of _taking_notes is to store notes in a specified session.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· session_id: A string representing the unique identifier for the current session in which the note is being stored.
· note: A string containing the content of the note to be stored.

**Code Description**: The _taking_notes function is a private utility designed to insert a note into a SQLite database associated with a specific session. It generates a unique identifier for the note using the uuid library, ensuring that each note can be distinctly referenced. The function begins by acquiring a lock to prevent concurrent access issues, which is crucial in a multi-threaded environment. It then establishes a connection to the SQLite database specified by the _DB_PATH variable, ensuring that the connection is thread-safe by setting check_same_thread to False.

Once the connection is established, the function executes an SQL INSERT statement to add the note into the 'notes' table, which includes the generated note ID, the session ID, and the note content. After executing the insert operation, the function commits the transaction to save the changes to the database and subsequently closes the connection to free up resources.

The function returns a dictionary indicating the status of the operation, with a status key set to "ok" and the note_id of the newly created note. This function is called by the taking_notes function, which is responsible for processing a list of notes provided in a JSON format. The taking_notes function validates the input, ensuring that it is correctly formatted and that each note adheres to the expected structure. For each valid note, it invokes _taking_notes to store the note in the database, collecting the generated note IDs for successful entries and returning them in the response.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the session_id is valid and that the note content is properly formatted before invoking this function. Failure to do so may lead to errors during the note storage process.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be:
```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "note_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```
## FunctionDef _retrieve_notes(session_id)
**_retrieve_notes**: The function of _retrieve_notes is to retrieve all notes associated with a specified session ID from a SQLite database.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· session_id: A string representing the unique identifier for the session whose notes are to be retrieved.

**Code Description**: The _retrieve_notes function is designed to access a SQLite database and fetch all notes linked to a given session ID. It begins by acquiring a lock to ensure thread safety during the database operation. The function establishes a connection to the database using the path specified by the _DB_PATH variable, with the option to allow access from multiple threads. 

Once the connection is established, it executes a SQL query to select all notes from the 'notes' table where the session_id matches the provided session_id. The results are ordered by the timestamp to maintain the chronological order of the notes. After fetching the results, the connection to the database is closed to free up resources.

The function processes the fetched rows to extract the note content, which is stored in a list. Finally, it concatenates all notes into a single string, separating each note with a newline character, and returns this string.

This function is called by the retrieve_notes function, which is responsible for obtaining the current session ID and ensuring that it is set before invoking _retrieve_notes. If the session ID is not available, retrieve_notes raises a RuntimeError. Thus, _retrieve_notes operates as a private utility function that supports the public interface of retrieve_notes by encapsulating the database access logic.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the session_id passed to _retrieve_notes is valid and corresponds to an existing session in the database. Failure to do so may result in an empty string being returned if no notes are found for the given session ID.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from _retrieve_notes could be:
```
"Note 1 content\nNote 2 content\nNote 3 content"
```
## FunctionDef taking_notes(note)
**taking_notes**: The function of taking_notes is to store notes for the current session in a structured format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this function.
· note: A JSON-formatted string representing a list of notes, each enclosed within `<note>...</note>` tags. The notes are expected to contain content that may reference external citations using `<citation>...</citation>` tags.

**Code Description**: The `taking_notes` function is designed to accept a JSON string representing a list of notes, each formatted with `<note>...</note>` tags. These notes are parsed and validated before being stored in the system. 

1. **Session Validation**: The function first retrieves the current session ID through the `_current_session_id.get()` method. If the session ID is not set, a `RuntimeError` is raised, indicating that the notes cannot be stored without a valid session ID.

2. **JSON Parsing and Validation**: The function attempts to parse the input `note` string using Python's `json.loads()` method. If the input is not a valid JSON, an error message with the details of the parsing failure is returned. If the parsed object is not a list, another error message is returned indicating that the input must be a JSON list of note strings.

3. **Note Validation**: The function then iterates over the list of notes. For each note:
   - It checks whether the note is a string.
   - It ensures that each note starts with `<note>` and ends with `</note>`. If any note fails this validation, an error message is returned, indicating the specific index of the invalid note and the nature of the error.

4. **Storing Notes**: For each valid note, the function calls the `_taking_notes` function, passing the session ID and the raw note content. The `_taking_notes` function is responsible for saving the note to the database. If the note is successfully stored, the generated note ID is appended to a list of saved note IDs.

5. **Final Return**: Once all notes have been processed, the function returns a dictionary. If all notes were successfully saved, the dictionary contains a status of "ok" and the list of generated note IDs. If any note failed to be saved, the function returns an error message detailing the failure.

This function is invoked by components such as the `WorkflowExecutor` class in the `src/criticsearch/workflow.py` module, where it is used as part of a tool registry that processes user queries and stores related notes.

**Note**: 
- The session ID must be set before calling this function. If it is not set, the function will raise a `RuntimeError`.
- The input JSON string must strictly follow the expected structure, with each note being a string enclosed in `<note>...</note>` tags.
- The `_taking_notes` function, which is called by `taking_notes`, is responsible for the actual persistence of the notes to the database. It ensures that each note is saved under the correct session, generating a unique note ID in the process.

**Output Example**: A successful execution of the function might return the following JSON structure:

```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "note_ids": [
        "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
        "987e6543-e21b-32d4-a567-789654321000"
    ]
}
``` 

If an error occurs, the returned JSON would look like:

```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Invalid note format at index 1: must start with <note> and end with </note>."
}
```
## FunctionDef retrieve_notes
**retrieve_notes**: The function of retrieve_notes is to retrieve all notes associated with the current session.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The retrieve_notes function is responsible for gathering all notes associated with the current session. It first attempts to retrieve the session ID using the _current_session_id.get() method. If the session ID is not set (i.e., if it is None or empty), the function raises a RuntimeError, indicating that the session ID is not available and notes cannot be retrieved.

If a valid session ID is found, the function proceeds by calling the _retrieve_notes function, passing the session ID as an argument. The _retrieve_notes function is responsible for accessing the underlying database to fetch the notes associated with the session ID. It returns a concatenated string of all the notes, separated by newline characters.

This function is integral to managing session-based data in the application, specifically for retrieving notes linked to the ongoing session. It acts as a public-facing method that ensures a valid session ID exists before delegating the actual work to the internal _retrieve_notes function.

The retrieve_notes function is typically called in scenarios where the notes for a particular session need to be accessed or presented, such as when displaying the history of actions or information related to a user query.

**Note**: 
- If the session ID is not set, the function raises a RuntimeError, which should be handled appropriately by the calling code to ensure smooth operation.
- The function relies on the session ID being correctly initialized earlier in the workflow, so developers should ensure the session ID is set before calling retrieve_notes.

**Output Example**: 
A possible output of the retrieve_notes function would be:
```
"Note 1 content\nNote 2 content\nNote 3 content"
```
This output consists of a series of notes, each separated by a newline character, ready for consumption by the system or user interface.
