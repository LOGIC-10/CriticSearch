## ClassDef ContentScraper
**ContentScraper**: The function of ContentScraper is to scrape content from provided URLs using a combination of API-based extraction and fallback web scraping.

**attributes**:  
· urls: List of strings containing the URLs to be scraped.  

**Code Description**:  
The `ContentScraper` class contains a single static method `scrape`, which is designed to scrape content from a list of URLs. This method handles the process of scraping through an external service (Tavily API) and, in case of failure, falls back to web scraping using another method. The `scrape` method performs the following key operations:

1. **Tavily API Extraction**:  
   The method begins by extracting an API key from the settings configuration. It initializes an instance of `TavilyExtract` with this key. The `TavilyExtract` class is responsible for interacting with the Tavily API, which is used to attempt content extraction from the provided URLs. The `scrape` method asynchronously calls `tavily.extract_content(urls)` to perform the extraction.

2. **Error Handling and Fallback**:  
   If the Tavily API response contains an error (as indicated by the presence of a "detail" key in the response), the method logs an error message and proceeds with a fallback scraping approach. The fallback scraping is performed by the `FallbackWebScraper`, which scrapes content directly from the web.

3. **Processing Successful Results**:  
   In cases where Tavily extraction is successful, the results are processed. The method iterates over the successful results returned by Tavily. For each result, the URL and raw content are extracted, and a `ScrapedData` object is created to store these values. These successful results are then stored in a list.

4. **Handling Failed Results**:  
   If some URLs fail in the Tavily extraction process, the method logs this issue and proceeds to scrape those URLs using the fallback web scraper. The failed results are processed in a similar way to the successful ones, resulting in another list of `ScrapedData`.

5. **Merging Results**:  
   After handling both successful and failed results, the method merges these two sets of results into a final list and wraps it in a `ScrapedDataList` object. This final result is then returned by the method after invoking `model_dump()` to serialize the data for further processing or storage.

This class is called within the context of the `BaseAgent` class, where an instance of `ContentScraper` is created and used to scrape content as part of the agent's overall functionality. Specifically, `BaseAgent` utilizes the `scrape` method to extract relevant content from URLs during its execution flow. It relies on the `ContentScraper` for content extraction, which is an essential part of the agent’s toolset, enabling the agent to gather and process web data.

**Note**:  
When using the `ContentScraper` class, ensure that the settings are correctly configured, particularly the API key for Tavily, and that the fallback web scraper is available. The success of the content scraping process is dependent on both the Tavily API's performance and the fallback web scraper's ability to handle failed cases. The `scrape` method is asynchronous and should be called within an asynchronous context.

**Output Example**:  
A possible return value from the `scrape` method could be a serialized list of `ScrapedData` objects, each containing the URL and the corresponding scraped content. The serialized structure may look like:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/article1",
      "content": "This is the scraped content from article 1."
    },
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/article2",
      "content": "This is the scraped content from article 2."
    }
  ]
}
```
### FunctionDef scrape(urls)
**scrape**: The function of scrape is to scrape content using the provided URLs.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· urls: List[str] - A list of URLs to scrape content from.

**Code Description**: The scrape function is an asynchronous method designed to extract content from a list of URLs. It begins by retrieving an API key from the settings, which is essential for authenticating requests to the Tavily API. An instance of the TavilyExtract class is then created using this API key.

The function attempts to extract content using the Tavily API by calling the extract_content method of the TavilyExtract instance. If the extraction is successful, the results are processed to create a list of ScrapedData objects, which encapsulate the URL and the raw content retrieved.

In the event that the Tavily API returns an error or if there are failed results, the function logs an appropriate message using the RichPrinter's log method, indicating the failure and the fallback to web scraping. It then invokes the scrape method of the FallbackWebScraper class to handle the URLs that failed during the Tavily extraction.

The final results, which may include both successfully scraped data and any fallback results, are aggregated into a ScrapedDataList object. This object is then serialized and returned, providing a structured output of the scraping operation.

The scrape function is called within the ContentScraper class, which is instantiated in the BaseAgent class. The BaseAgent class initializes the ContentScraper and registers its schema for use in the agent's operations. Additionally, the scrape function is invoked by the web_scrape_results method in the BaseAgent class, which facilitates web content extraction based on search results.

This function plays a critical role in the overall content scraping workflow, ensuring that data is retrieved accurately and efficiently from external sources. Its design emphasizes error handling and resilience, making it a vital component of the content extraction process.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the URLs provided are valid and accessible. The function is built to handle errors and retries, but the initial input must be correct for optimal performance.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```json
{
    "data": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "content": "No content available"}
    ]
}
```
