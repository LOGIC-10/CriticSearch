## ClassDef ContentScraper
**ContentScraper**: The function of ContentScraper is to scrape content from provided URLs using a combination of API-based extraction and fallback web scraping.

**attributes**:  
· urls: List of strings containing the URLs to be scraped.  

**Code Description**:  
The `ContentScraper` class contains a single static method `scrape`, which is designed to scrape content from a list of URLs. This method handles the process of scraping through an external service (Tavily API) and, in case of failure, falls back to web scraping using another method. The `scrape` method performs the following key operations:

1. **Tavily API Extraction**:  
   The method begins by extracting an API key from the settings configuration. It initializes an instance of `TavilyExtract` with this key. The `TavilyExtract` class is responsible for interacting with the Tavily API, which is used to attempt content extraction from the provided URLs. The `scrape` method asynchronously calls `tavily.extract_content(urls)` to perform the extraction.

2. **Error Handling and Fallback**:  
   If the Tavily API response contains an error (as indicated by the presence of a "detail" key in the response), the method logs an error message and proceeds with a fallback scraping approach. The fallback scraping is performed by the `FallbackWebScraper`, which scrapes content directly from the web.

3. **Processing Successful Results**:  
   In cases where Tavily extraction is successful, the results are processed. The method iterates over the successful results returned by Tavily. For each result, the URL and raw content are extracted, and a `ScrapedData` object is created to store these values. These successful results are then stored in a list.

4. **Handling Failed Results**:  
   If some URLs fail in the Tavily extraction process, the method logs this issue and proceeds to scrape those URLs using the fallback web scraper. The failed results are processed in a similar way to the successful ones, resulting in another list of `ScrapedData`.

5. **Merging Results**:  
   After handling both successful and failed results, the method merges these two sets of results into a final list and wraps it in a `ScrapedDataList` object. This final result is then returned by the method after invoking `model_dump()` to serialize the data for further processing or storage.

This class is called within the context of the `BaseAgent` class, where an instance of `ContentScraper` is created and used to scrape content as part of the agent's overall functionality. Specifically, `BaseAgent` utilizes the `scrape` method to extract relevant content from URLs during its execution flow. It relies on the `ContentScraper` for content extraction, which is an essential part of the agent’s toolset, enabling the agent to gather and process web data.

**Note**:  
When using the `ContentScraper` class, ensure that the settings are correctly configured, particularly the API key for Tavily, and that the fallback web scraper is available. The success of the content scraping process is dependent on both the Tavily API's performance and the fallback web scraper's ability to handle failed cases. The `scrape` method is asynchronous and should be called within an asynchronous context.

**Output Example**:  
A possible return value from the `scrape` method could be a serialized list of `ScrapedData` objects, each containing the URL and the corresponding scraped content. The serialized structure may look like:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/article1",
      "content": "This is the scraped content from article 1."
    },
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/article2",
      "content": "This is the scraped content from article 2."
    }
  ]
}
```
### FunctionDef scrape(urls)
**scrape**: The function of scrape is to scrape content using the provided URLs.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· urls: List[str] - A list of URLs to scrape content from.

**Code Description**: The scrape function is an asynchronous method designed to extract content from a list of URLs. It begins by retrieving the API key from the settings configuration, which is essential for authenticating requests to the Tavily API. An instance of the TavilyExtract class is then created using this API key, enabling interaction with the Tavily API for content extraction.

The function attempts to extract content from the provided URLs by calling the extract_content method of the TavilyExtract instance. This method sends a request to the Tavily API and returns a response containing the results of the extraction. If the Tavily API response indicates an error (identified by the presence of a "detail" key), the function logs the error message using the RichPrinter's log method and falls back to a secondary scraping method provided by the FallbackWebScraper class.

In the case of a successful extraction from the Tavily API, the function processes the results by iterating through the returned data. For each successful result, it constructs a ScrapedData object containing the URL and the raw content extracted from that URL. If there are any failed results in the Tavily response, these URLs are logged, and the function calls the FallbackWebScraper's scrape method to attempt to retrieve content from those URLs as well.

Finally, the function merges both successful and failed results into a ScrapedDataList object, which is returned after being serialized using the model_dump method. This structured approach ensures that the scrape function effectively handles both successful and failed content extraction attempts, providing a comprehensive output that includes all relevant data.

The scrape function is called within the BaseAgent class, specifically in the web_scrape_results method, which orchestrates the web scraping process based on search results. It is also invoked in the _action_router function, where it plays a critical role in the decision-making process of the intelligent agent, allowing it to gather content from various sources as needed.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the URLs provided are valid and accessible. The function is built to handle errors and retries, but the initial input must be correct for optimal performance.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{
    "data": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "content": "No content available"}
    ]
}
```
