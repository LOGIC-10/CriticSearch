## ClassDef ContentScraper
**ContentScraper**: The function of ContentScraper is to scrape content from provided URLs using a combination of API-based extraction and fallback web scraping.

**attributes**:  
· urls: List of strings containing the URLs to be scraped.  

**Code Description**:  
The `ContentScraper` class contains a single static method `scrape`, which is designed to scrape content from a list of URLs. This method handles the process of scraping through an external service (Tavily API) and, in case of failure, falls back to web scraping using another method. The `scrape` method performs the following key operations:

1. **Tavily API Extraction**:  
   The method begins by extracting an API key from the settings configuration. It initializes an instance of `TavilyExtract` with this key. The `TavilyExtract` class is responsible for interacting with the Tavily API, which is used to attempt content extraction from the provided URLs. The `scrape` method asynchronously calls `tavily.extract_content(urls)` to perform the extraction.

2. **Error Handling and Fallback**:  
   If the Tavily API response contains an error (as indicated by the presence of a "detail" key in the response), the method logs an error message and proceeds with a fallback scraping approach. The fallback scraping is performed by the `FallbackWebScraper`, which scrapes content directly from the web.

3. **Processing Successful Results**:  
   In cases where Tavily extraction is successful, the results are processed. The method iterates over the successful results returned by Tavily. For each result, the URL and raw content are extracted, and a `ScrapedData` object is created to store these values. These successful results are then stored in a list.

4. **Handling Failed Results**:  
   If some URLs fail in the Tavily extraction process, the method logs this issue and proceeds to scrape those URLs using the fallback web scraper. The failed results are processed in a similar way to the successful ones, resulting in another list of `ScrapedData`.

5. **Merging Results**:  
   After handling both successful and failed results, the method merges these two sets of results into a final list and wraps it in a `ScrapedDataList` object. This final result is then returned by the method after invoking `model_dump()` to serialize the data for further processing or storage.

This class is called within the context of the `BaseAgent` class, where an instance of `ContentScraper` is created and used to scrape content as part of the agent's overall functionality. Specifically, `BaseAgent` utilizes the `scrape` method to extract relevant content from URLs during its execution flow. It relies on the `ContentScraper` for content extraction, which is an essential part of the agent’s toolset, enabling the agent to gather and process web data.

**Note**:  
When using the `ContentScraper` class, ensure that the settings are correctly configured, particularly the API key for Tavily, and that the fallback web scraper is available. The success of the content scraping process is dependent on both the Tavily API's performance and the fallback web scraper's ability to handle failed cases. The `scrape` method is asynchronous and should be called within an asynchronous context.

**Output Example**:  
A possible return value from the `scrape` method could be a serialized list of `ScrapedData` objects, each containing the URL and the corresponding scraped content. The serialized structure may look like:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/article1",
      "content": "This is the scraped content from article 1."
    },
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/article2",
      "content": "This is the scraped content from article 2."
    }
  ]
}
```
### FunctionDef scrape(urls)
**scrape**: The function of scrape is to scrape content using the provided URLs.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· urls: List[str] - A list of URLs to scrape content from.

**Code Description**: The `scrape` function is an asynchronous method designed to extract content from a list of URLs. It begins by retrieving the API key from the settings and initializing an instance of the `TavilyExtract` class, which is responsible for interacting with the Tavily API. The function then attempts to extract content using the `extract_content` method of the `TavilyExtract` instance, passing the provided URLs.

Upon receiving the results from the Tavily API, the function checks for any errors indicated in the response. If an error is detected, it logs the error message using the `log` method from the `RichPrinter` class, indicating that the Tavily API extraction has failed and that the function will fall back to a secondary scraping method. In this case, it invokes the `scrape` method of the `FallbackWebScraper` class to handle the URLs that failed during the Tavily extraction.

If the Tavily API returns successful results, the function processes these results by extracting the necessary data, such as the URL and raw content, and constructs `ScrapedData` objects for each successful extraction. It also checks for any failed results from the Tavily API and logs them, subsequently attempting to scrape the failed URLs using the fallback method.

Finally, the function aggregates both successful and failed results into a `ScrapedDataList` object, which is returned after being serialized through the `model_dump` method. This structured approach ensures that the function can handle both successful and unsuccessful scraping attempts, providing a comprehensive output of the scraping operation.

The `scrape` function is called by the `web_scrape_results` method within the `BaseAgent` class, which orchestrates the process of searching for information and subsequently scraping content based on the search results. This highlights the function's role in enhancing the agent's ability to provide accurate and relevant responses by leveraging real-time data from web sources.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the URLs provided are valid and accessible. Additionally, proper error handling is implemented to manage cases where the scraping operations do not yield results.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{
    "data": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "title": "Example Title", "content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "title": "Another Example", "content": "No content available"}
    ]
}
```
