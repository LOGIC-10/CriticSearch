## ClassDef TavilyExtract
**TavilyExtract**: The function of TavilyExtract is to interact with the Tavily API to asynchronously extract content from a list of URLs.

**attributes**:
· `base_url`: A string representing the base URL for the Tavily API (`"https://api.tavily.com/extract"`).
· `_api_key`: A string storing the API key used for authorization with the Tavily API.
· `headers`: A dictionary containing the HTTP headers for making requests to the Tavily API, including `Content-Type` and `Authorization`.

**Code Description**:  
The `TavilyExtract` class is designed to interact with the Tavily API to extract content from a given list of URLs. It provides an asynchronous method, `extract_content`, which sends a POST request to the Tavily API for content extraction.

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - This method accepts an `api_key` parameter, which is required to authenticate requests to the Tavily API.
   - The `base_url` is set to the Tavily API endpoint (`"https://api.tavily.com/extract"`), and the `headers` dictionary is populated with the appropriate authentication headers using the provided `api_key`.
  
2. **Content Extraction (`extract_content` method)**:
   - The `extract_content` method is an asynchronous function that accepts a list of URLs (`urls: List[str]`) and sends a POST request to the Tavily API to extract content from these URLs.
   - A `payload` is created, containing the list of URLs, and a request is made using `httpx.AsyncClient` with HTTP/2 support for optimal performance.
   - The method awaits the response, processes the returned data, and returns the parsed JSON content from the Tavily API response.
   - If any errors occur during the request (e.g., network issues, invalid API response), a dictionary is returned containing an error message with the details of the issue.

**Relationship with Other Project Components**:
- The `TavilyExtract` class is utilized by the `scrape` function in the `ContentScraper` module, which is designed to scrape content from multiple URLs.
- The `scrape` function leverages the `extract_content` method of `TavilyExtract` to retrieve content from the Tavily API. If the API call is successful, the results are processed, and a `ScrapedDataList` is returned. If the Tavily API fails to extract content, the function falls back to using a secondary web scraping method via the `FallbackWebScraper` class.
- The `scrape` function handles the aggregation of both successful and failed extraction results and ensures that content from URLs is collected despite any errors with the Tavily API.

**Note**:  
- Ensure that a valid API key is provided when instantiating the `TavilyExtract` class, as this key is required for authorization with the Tavily API.
- The method `extract_content` is asynchronous and should be called within an asynchronous context (e.g., using `await`).
- The content extracted from the URLs will be returned as a JSON object. If the extraction fails, an error message will be returned instead of the expected data.

**Output Example**:  
A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{
    "data": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "title": "Example Title", "content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "title": "Another Example", "content": "No content available"}
    ]
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, api_key)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the TavilyExtract object by setting up the base URL for API requests and configuring the necessary headers for authentication.

**parameters**: The parameters of this function.
· api_key: str - This is the API key required for authenticating requests to the Tavily API.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` function is the constructor method of the `TavilyExtract` class. It is responsible for setting up the essential attributes needed to interact with the Tavily API. Upon initialization:

1. The `base_url` attribute is assigned a fixed value, `"https://api.tavily.com/extract"`. This URL is the endpoint used for making API requests.
  
2. The `_api_key` attribute is initialized with the provided `api_key` parameter, which is a string containing the user's personal API key. This key is used to authenticate requests made to the Tavily API.

3. The `headers` attribute is a dictionary containing two key-value pairs:
   - `"Content-Type": "application/json"`: This specifies that the data being sent in requests will be formatted as JSON.
   - `"Authorization": f"Bearer {self._api_key}"`: This header is used for bearer token authentication, where the API key is included in the Authorization header to verify the identity of the requester.

This constructor ensures that an instance of the `TavilyExtract` class is correctly set up with the necessary API URL and authentication details for subsequent API interactions.

**Note**: 
- The `api_key` parameter is mandatory for initializing the `TavilyExtract` class and must be kept secure to prevent unauthorized access.
- The `base_url` and `headers` are automatically configured and cannot be modified directly through the constructor. Any changes to these values would require altering the code itself.

### FunctionDef extract_content(self, urls)
**extract_content**: The function of extract_content is to asynchronously send a request to an external API to extract content from a list of provided URLs.

**parameters**: The parameters of this function.
· urls: List[str] - A list of URLs from which the content needs to be extracted.

**Code Description**: The `extract_content` function is an asynchronous method responsible for extracting content from a list of URLs. It takes a list of URLs as an argument, constructs a payload with the URLs, and sends a POST request to a specified base URL using the HTTPX client with support for HTTP/2. This operation is performed inside a context manager to ensure proper resource management.

The function begins by defining the payload containing the list of URLs, which is then sent in a POST request to the API endpoint. The request includes the appropriate headers, which are passed from the instance's configuration. The response from the API is expected to be in JSON format. Upon receiving the response, the function parses the JSON data and returns it to the caller.

If an error occurs during the request (e.g., network issues, server errors), the function catches the `httpx.RequestError` exception. In this case, it returns a dictionary with an error message indicating the nature of the issue.

This function is typically invoked in a larger process, where the content extracted from the URLs is further processed. For example, the `search_validator` method calls `extract_content` to retrieve content from search results. It uses the URLs of the top search results to fetch the content, then processes it by joining the raw content into a corpus, which is passed to an LLM model for further use.

In summary, `extract_content` is a utility function designed to interact with an external content extraction API and handle errors gracefully by returning structured error information if needed.

**Note**: Ensure that the URLs provided are valid and accessible. Network issues or incorrect configurations may result in a request error. The function is built to handle such cases by returning a structured error message.

**Output Example**:
```
{
    "data": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "title": "Example Title", "content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "title": "Another Example", "content": "No content available"}
    ]
}
```
