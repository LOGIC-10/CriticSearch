## ClassDef TavilyExtract
**TavilyExtract**: The function of TavilyExtract is to interact with the Tavily API to extract content from a list of URLs.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· api_key: str - The API key used for authenticating requests to the Tavily API.  
· base_url: str - The base URL for the Tavily API endpoint used for content extraction.  
· headers: dict - The headers required for the API request, including content type and authorization.  
· _client: AsyncClient - An instance of the AsyncClient from the httpx library, configured to support HTTP/2 for making asynchronous requests.

**Code Description**: The TavilyExtract class is designed to facilitate the extraction of content from web pages using the Tavily API. Upon initialization, it requires an API key, which is essential for authenticating requests to the API. The class sets up a base URL pointing to the Tavily API's extract endpoint and prepares the necessary headers, including the content type and authorization token.

The primary method of this class is `extract_content`, which is an asynchronous function that accepts a list of URLs. This method is decorated with a retry mechanism that allows it to automatically retry the request in case of failures, up to a maximum number of retries defined in the settings. The method constructs a payload containing the URLs and sends a POST request to the Tavily API. It handles various exceptions, including request errors and HTTP status errors, logging warnings as necessary.

If the response from the API is successful, the method attempts to parse the JSON response. If the JSON parsing fails, it triggers a retry. The method is designed to return the parsed JSON data as a dictionary. In the event of a network request error or an HTTP status error, the method raises the appropriate exceptions after logging the warnings.

The TavilyExtract class is utilized within the `ReverseUpgradeWorkflow` class, where it serves as a scraper for extracting content from URLs. The `ReverseUpgradeWorkflow` initializes an instance of TavilyExtract with a predefined API key, allowing it to leverage the content extraction capabilities provided by Tavily. Additionally, the TavilyExtract class is called within the `scrape` method of the ContentScraper class, which orchestrates the scraping process by first attempting to extract content using Tavily and falling back to a secondary scraping method if necessary.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the API key provided during the initialization of the TavilyExtract instance is valid and has the necessary permissions to access the Tavily API. Proper error handling is implemented to manage cases where the API requests fail or return unexpected results.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{
    "results": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "raw_content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "raw_content": "No content available"}
    ],
    "failed_results": []
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, api_key)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the TavilyExtract class with the necessary API key and set up the required configurations for making API requests.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· api_key: A string representing the API key required for authentication when making requests to the Tavily API.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the TavilyExtract class. It takes a single parameter, api_key, which is essential for authenticating requests to the Tavily API. Upon instantiation of the class, the function performs the following actions:

1. It sets the base URL for the Tavily API to "https://api.tavily.com/extract". This URL will be used as the endpoint for all subsequent API calls made by the instance.

2. The provided api_key is stored in a private attribute, _api_key, which ensures that the key is not directly accessible from outside the class. This is a common practice to enhance security by encapsulating sensitive information.

3. The function initializes a headers dictionary that contains two key-value pairs:
   - "Content-Type": This is set to "application/json", indicating that the requests sent to the API will be in JSON format.
   - "Authorization": This is set to "Bearer {self._api_key}", which is the standard way to include the API key in the request headers for authorization purposes.

4. Finally, an asynchronous HTTP client is created using httpx.AsyncClient with HTTP/2 support enabled. This client will be used for making asynchronous requests to the Tavily API, allowing for efficient handling of multiple requests without blocking the execution of the program.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the api_key provided is valid and has the necessary permissions to access the Tavily API. Additionally, since the HTTP client is asynchronous, the methods that utilize this client should be defined as asynchronous functions to take full advantage of its capabilities.

### FunctionDef extract_content(self, urls)
**extract_content**: The function of extract_content is to send requests to the Tavily API and parse the JSON response, with automatic retries in case of network or parsing failures.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· urls: List[str] - A list of URLs that need to be processed by the Tavily API.

**Code Description**: The extract_content function is an asynchronous method designed to interact with the Tavily API. It takes a list of URLs as input and constructs a payload to send to the API. The function initiates a POST request to the Tavily API using an HTTP client. Upon receiving the response, it checks for any HTTP errors and attempts to parse the JSON content.

If the JSON parsing fails due to a JSONDecodeError, the function logs a warning message indicating the failure and triggers a retry mechanism. Similarly, if there is a network request error or an HTTP status error, it logs the corresponding warning and raises the error to initiate a retry. The function is designed to handle these errors gracefully, allowing for a specified number of retries as defined in the settings.

The extract_content function is called by other components within the project, such as the scrape function in the ContentScraper class. The scrape function utilizes extract_content to retrieve content from the specified URLs, handling both successful and failed extraction attempts. This highlights the role of extract_content as a critical component in the content scraping workflow, ensuring that data is fetched reliably from the Tavily API.

Additionally, the extract_content function is invoked by the search_validator function, which validates the model's response against the content retrieved from the URLs. This further emphasizes the importance of extract_content in providing accurate and relevant data for subsequent processing and validation steps.

**Note**: When using the extract_content function, it is essential to ensure that the URLs provided are valid and accessible. The function is built to handle errors and retries, but the initial input must be correct for optimal performance.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{
    "results": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "raw_content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "raw_content": "No content available"}
    ],
    "failed_results": []
}
```
