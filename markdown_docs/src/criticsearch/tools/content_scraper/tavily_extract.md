## ClassDef TavilyExtract
**TavilyExtract**: The function of TavilyExtract is to interact with the Tavily API to extract content from specified URLs.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· api_key: str - The API key used for authenticating requests to the Tavily API.  
· base_url: str - The base URL for the Tavily API endpoint used for content extraction.  
· headers: dict - A dictionary containing the headers required for the API request, including content type and authorization.  
· _client: AsyncClient - An instance of the AsyncClient from the httpx library, configured to support HTTP/2 for making asynchronous requests.

**Code Description**: The TavilyExtract class is designed to facilitate content extraction from web pages using the Tavily API. Upon initialization, it requires an API key, which is essential for authenticating requests to the API. The class sets up the base URL for the API endpoint and prepares the necessary headers, including the content type and authorization token.

The primary method of this class is `extract_content`, which is an asynchronous method that accepts a list of URLs. This method constructs a payload containing the URLs and additional parameters for the extraction process. It utilizes the AsyncClient to send a POST request to the Tavily API, handling the response in a structured manner.

The `extract_content` method is decorated with a retry mechanism that allows it to automatically retry the request in case of network errors or if the response cannot be parsed as JSON. This is crucial for ensuring robustness in scenarios where the API may be temporarily unavailable or return unexpected results.

In the event of a successful response, the method attempts to parse the JSON data returned by the API. If the parsing fails, it triggers a retry, logging a warning message for the developer's awareness. Similarly, if a network request fails or the API returns an HTTP error status, appropriate warnings are logged, and the method raises exceptions to signal the failure.

The TavilyExtract class is utilized within the ReverseUpgradeWorkflow class, where it serves as a scraper to extract content from URLs provided during the workflow's execution. The integration with the SearchAggregator and BaseAgent classes highlights its role in enhancing the quality of the questions and answers being processed by leveraging external content.

Additionally, the TavilyExtract class is called within the scrape function of the ContentScraper class, which orchestrates the content extraction process. This function attempts to extract content using the Tavily API and falls back to a secondary scraping method if the Tavily extraction fails, demonstrating the importance of the TavilyExtract class in the overall content scraping workflow.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the API key provided during the initialization of the TavilyExtract class is valid and that the URLs passed to the `extract_content` method are accessible. The class is designed to handle errors and retries, but proper input is necessary for optimal performance.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```json
{
    "results": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "raw_content": "This is the main content of the page."}
    ],
    "failed_results": []
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, api_key)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the TavilyExtract class with the necessary API key and set up the required parameters for making API requests.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· api_key: A string that represents the API key required for authenticating requests to the Tavily API.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the TavilyExtract class. It takes a single parameter, api_key, which is expected to be a string. This API key is essential for authenticating requests made to the Tavily API. Upon instantiation of the class, the function sets the base URL for the API to "https://api.tavily.com/extract", which will be used for all subsequent API calls. The function also initializes an instance variable, _api_key, with the provided api_key to store the key securely within the class instance.

Additionally, the function constructs a headers dictionary that includes the "Content-Type" set to "application/json" and the "Authorization" set to the provided API key. This headers dictionary will be used in HTTP requests to ensure that the requests are properly formatted and authenticated.

Furthermore, the function creates an asynchronous HTTP client instance using httpx.AsyncClient with HTTP/2 support enabled. This client will facilitate making asynchronous requests to the Tavily API, allowing for efficient handling of multiple requests without blocking the execution of the program.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the provided API key is valid and has the necessary permissions to access the Tavily API. Users should also be aware that the httpx library must be installed in the environment to utilize the asynchronous client functionality.

### FunctionDef extract_content(self, urls)
**extract_content**: The function of extract_content is to send requests to the Tavily API to extract content from a list of provided URLs and return the results in a structured format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· urls: List[str] - A list of URLs from which content needs to be extracted.

**Code Description**: The extract_content function is an asynchronous method designed to interact with the Tavily API for content extraction. It accepts a list of URLs as input and constructs a payload that specifies the URLs to be processed. The function is structured to handle potential errors during the API request and JSON parsing, implementing a retry mechanism to ensure robustness.

Upon invocation, the function first prepares a payload containing the URLs and additional parameters such as `include_images` set to False and `extract_depth` set to "basic". It then attempts to send a POST request to the Tavily API using an asynchronous HTTP client. The response from the API is checked for successful status; if the request fails due to network issues or an HTTP error, the function logs a warning message and raises the corresponding exception.

In the case of a successful response, the function attempts to parse the JSON content returned by the API. If the JSON parsing fails, it logs a warning and raises an exception to trigger a retry. This retry mechanism is crucial for ensuring that transient issues do not lead to permanent failures in content extraction.

The extract_content function is called by other components within the project, such as the scrape function in the ContentScraper class. The scrape function utilizes extract_content to retrieve content from URLs obtained through search results. Additionally, it is invoked by the search_validator function, which validates the correctness of a model's answer by leveraging the content extracted from the URLs.

This function plays a critical role in the overall content extraction workflow, ensuring that data is retrieved accurately and efficiently from external sources. Its design emphasizes error handling and resilience, making it a vital component of the TavilyExtract class.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the URLs provided are valid and accessible. The function is built to handle errors and retries, but the initial input must be correct for optimal performance.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```json
{
    "data": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "raw_content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "raw_content": "No content available"}
    ]
}
```
