## ClassDef TavilyExtract
**TavilyExtract**: The function of TavilyExtract is to facilitate the extraction of content from a list of URLs using the Tavily API.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· api_key: str - The API key used for authenticating requests to the Tavily API.  
· base_url: str - The base URL for the Tavily API endpoint used for content extraction.  
· headers: dict - The headers required for making requests to the Tavily API, including content type and authorization.

**Code Description**: The TavilyExtract class is designed to interact with the Tavily API for the purpose of extracting content from specified URLs. Upon initialization, the class requires an API key, which is stored as a private attribute. The base URL for the Tavily API is set to "https://api.tavily.com/extract", and the necessary headers for making requests are constructed, including the content type and authorization using the provided API key.

The primary method of this class is `extract_content`, which accepts a list of URLs as its parameter. This method is asynchronous and utilizes the httpx library to send a POST request to the Tavily API. The request payload consists of the list of URLs, which is sent in JSON format. Upon receiving a response, the method attempts to parse the JSON data returned by the API. If the request is successful, the parsed data is returned. In the event of a request error, the method captures the exception and returns a structured error message indicating the nature of the issue.

The TavilyExtract class is utilized within the `scrape` function found in the ContentScraper module. In this context, an instance of TavilyExtract is created using an API key sourced from the application settings. The `scrape` function calls the `extract_content` method of the TavilyExtract instance to retrieve content from the provided URLs. If the Tavily API returns an error, the function logs the error and resorts to a fallback web scraping method to ensure that content extraction continues. This integration allows for a seamless workflow where the TavilyExtract class serves as the primary means of content extraction, while also providing a backup mechanism in case of failure.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the API key is valid and that the URLs provided are accessible. Additionally, be mindful of the legal and ethical considerations surrounding web scraping, including compliance with the target website's terms of service.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{
    "results": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "raw_content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "raw_content": "No content available"}
    ],
    "failed_results": []
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, api_key)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the TavilyExtract object by setting up the base URL for API requests and configuring the necessary headers for authentication.

**parameters**: The parameters of this function.
· api_key: str - This is the API key required for authenticating requests to the Tavily API.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` function is the constructor method of the `TavilyExtract` class. It is responsible for setting up the essential attributes needed to interact with the Tavily API. Upon initialization:

1. The `base_url` attribute is assigned a fixed value, `"https://api.tavily.com/extract"`. This URL is the endpoint used for making API requests.
  
2. The `_api_key` attribute is initialized with the provided `api_key` parameter, which is a string containing the user's personal API key. This key is used to authenticate requests made to the Tavily API.

3. The `headers` attribute is a dictionary containing two key-value pairs:
   - `"Content-Type": "application/json"`: This specifies that the data being sent in requests will be formatted as JSON.
   - `"Authorization": f"Bearer {self._api_key}"`: This header is used for bearer token authentication, where the API key is included in the Authorization header to verify the identity of the requester.

This constructor ensures that an instance of the `TavilyExtract` class is correctly set up with the necessary API URL and authentication details for subsequent API interactions.

**Note**: 
- The `api_key` parameter is mandatory for initializing the `TavilyExtract` class and must be kept secure to prevent unauthorized access.
- The `base_url` and `headers` are automatically configured and cannot be modified directly through the constructor. Any changes to these values would require altering the code itself.

### FunctionDef extract_content(self, urls)
**extract_content**: The function of extract_content is to asynchronously extract content from a list of provided URLs using the Tavily API.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· urls: List[str] - A list of URLs to scrape content from.

**Code Description**: The `extract_content` function is an asynchronous method that takes a list of URLs as input and sends a POST request to the Tavily API to extract content from those URLs. The function begins by constructing a payload that includes the provided URLs. It then utilizes the `httpx.AsyncClient` to create an asynchronous HTTP client capable of handling HTTP/2 requests.

Within a try-except block, the function attempts to send the POST request to the API endpoint specified by `self.base_url`, including necessary headers and the JSON payload. Upon receiving a response, the function parses the JSON data from the response and returns it. If a request error occurs during this process, the function catches the exception and returns a structured error message indicating the nature of the request error.

This function is called by the `scrape` function within the `ContentScraper` class. The `scrape` function orchestrates the content extraction process by first invoking `extract_content` to retrieve data from the Tavily API. If the API call is successful, the `scrape` function processes the results, creating `ScrapedData` objects for each successful extraction. In cases where the Tavily API returns an error or fails to extract content from certain URLs, the `scrape` function logs the error and may fall back to an alternative web scraping method.

The integration of `extract_content` within the `scrape` function highlights its role as a critical component in the content extraction workflow, enabling seamless interaction with the Tavily API to facilitate data retrieval from multiple URLs.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the URLs provided are valid and accessible. Additionally, be aware of the legal and ethical considerations surrounding web scraping, including compliance with the target website's terms of service.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{
    "results": [
        {"url": "http://example.com", "raw_content": "This is the main content of the page."},
        {"url": "http://anotherexample.com", "raw_content": "No content available"}
    ],
    "failed_results": []
}
```
