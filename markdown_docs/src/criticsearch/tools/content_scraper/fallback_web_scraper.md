## ClassDef FallbackWebScraper
**FallbackWebScraper**: The function of FallbackWebScraper is to scrape content from a list of webpages asynchronously, serving as a fallback mechanism when the Tavily API fails.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· urls: List[str] - A list of URLs to scrape content from.

**Code Description**: The FallbackWebScraper class contains a static method named `scrape`, which is designed to handle the asynchronous scraping of web content from a provided list of URLs. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where the primary content extraction method, the Tavily API, encounters issues or fails to return valid results. 

The `scrape` method begins by defining a set of HTTP headers to mimic a standard web browser request, enhancing the likelihood of successful content retrieval. It then defines an inner asynchronous function `fetch_url`, which takes a single URL as an argument. This function is responsible for making the actual HTTP GET request using the `httpx` library, which supports asynchronous operations and HTTP/2.

Within `fetch_url`, the method attempts to fetch the content of the specified URL. If the response status code is not 200 (indicating a successful request), it returns a `ScrapedData` object containing the URL and an error message detailing the HTTP status code and reason. If the request is successful, the HTML content is parsed using BeautifulSoup, where unwanted elements such as scripts and styles are removed to focus on the main content.

The main content is extracted by searching for common HTML structures like `<main>`, `<article>`, or `<div>` elements that typically contain the primary content of a webpage. If no main content is found, a default message indicating "No content available" is returned. Otherwise, the text from paragraph tags is concatenated and cleaned up to form the final content string. The method then returns a `ScrapedData` object containing the URL, the page title, and the extracted content.

The `scrape` method utilizes `asyncio.gather` to concurrently fetch content from all provided URLs, improving efficiency and reducing overall scraping time.

This class is called by the `scrape` method of the `ContentScraper` class, which first attempts to extract content using the Tavily API. If the Tavily API fails, the `FallbackWebScraper.scrape` method is invoked to handle the fallback scraping process. This relationship ensures that the FallbackWebScraper serves as a reliable alternative for content extraction when the primary method is unavailable.

**Note**: When using this code, ensure that the URLs provided are valid and accessible. Additionally, be aware of the legal and ethical considerations surrounding web scraping, including compliance with the target website's terms of service.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
[
    ScrapedData(url="http://example.com", title="Example Title", content="This is the main content of the page."),
    ScrapedData(url="http://anotherexample.com", title="Another Example", content="No content available")
]
```
### FunctionDef scrape(urls)
**scrape**: The function of scrape is to asynchronously scrape content from a list of webpages, utilizing a fallback mechanism if the Tavily API fails.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· urls: List[str] - A list of URLs from which the content will be scraped.

**Code Description**: The scrape function is designed to handle the asynchronous scraping of multiple webpages. It takes a list of URLs as input and returns a list of ScrapedData objects, which encapsulate the results of the scraping operation for each URL. The function begins by defining a headers dictionary that includes a User-Agent string to mimic a typical web browser request, which helps avoid potential blocks from the target websites.

Within the scrape function, an inner asynchronous function named fetch_url is defined. This function is responsible for making the actual HTTP requests to each URL. It utilizes the httpx library's AsyncClient to send GET requests with the specified headers and a timeout of 10 seconds. If the response status code is not 200 (indicating a successful request), the function constructs a ScrapedData object containing the URL and an error message detailing the HTTP status code and reason.

If the request is successful, the function processes the HTML content of the response using BeautifulSoup. It removes unwanted elements such as scripts, styles, and meta tags to focus on the main content of the page. The function then attempts to locate the main content area by searching for common HTML tags like <main>, <article>, or <div> with class names that suggest they contain the primary content. If no main content is found, it defaults to a message indicating that no content is available.

The content is extracted from the identified main content area by joining the text of all <p> tags, ensuring that excessive whitespace is removed. A ScrapedData object is then created with the URL, the title of the page (if available), and the extracted content.

The scrape function ultimately calls asyncio.gather to execute the fetch_url function concurrently for all URLs in the input list. This allows for efficient scraping of multiple pages at once, significantly reducing the time required compared to synchronous requests.

From a functional perspective, the scrape function is integral to the FallbackWebScraper module, providing a mechanism to retrieve webpage content when other methods, such as the Tavily API, are unavailable. The results are structured in ScrapedData objects, which standardize the output format, making it easier for other components of the system to handle both successful and failed scraping attempts.

**Note**: It is important to handle the ScrapedData objects carefully, particularly by checking the error attribute to determine if the scraping was successful. The content and title attributes may be None if the scraping process encounters issues or if the content is not available on the page.

**Output Example**: 
[
    ScrapedData(url="http://example.com", title="Example Domain", content="This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents.", error=None),
    ScrapedData(url="http://nonexistent.com", title=None, content=None, error="HTTP 404: Not Found")
]
#### FunctionDef fetch_url(url)
**fetch_url**: The function of fetch_url is to asynchronously retrieve and scrape content from a specified URL, returning structured data about the page, including its title and main content, or an error message if the retrieval fails.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· url: str - The URL from which the content is to be scraped.

**Code Description**: The fetch_url function is designed to perform an asynchronous HTTP GET request to a specified URL using the httpx library. It initiates an asynchronous context with an HTTP client that supports HTTP/2 and follows redirects. The function attempts to retrieve the content of the page within a timeout period of 10 seconds.

Upon receiving a response, the function checks the HTTP status code. If the status code is not 200 (indicating a successful request), it constructs and returns a ScrapedData object containing the URL and an error message that specifies the HTTP status code and reason phrase.

If the response is successful, the function proceeds to parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup. It removes unwanted elements such as scripts, styles, meta tags, and noscript tags to clean the document. The function then attempts to extract the main content of the page by searching for specific HTML tags, such as <main>, <article>, or <div> elements with class names that include "content", "main", or "article".

The extracted content is processed to ensure that it is clean and well-formatted, specifically by stripping unnecessary whitespace from paragraph elements. If no main content is found, a default message "No content available" is returned.

Finally, the function returns a ScrapedData object populated with the URL, the title of the page (if available), and the extracted content. If any exceptions occur during the process, the function captures the exception and returns a ScrapedData object with the URL and an error message indicating the nature of the error.

This function is integral to the web scraping process as it provides a structured way to handle both successful and failed scraping attempts. The results are encapsulated in ScrapedData objects, which can be further processed or aggregated by other components of the system, such as the FallbackWebScraper.

**Note**: It is important to handle the returned ScrapedData object with care, particularly by checking the error attribute to determine if the scraping was successful. The title and content attributes may be optional and could be None if the information is not available.

**Output Example**: 
A possible return value from the fetch_url function could look like this:
```
ScrapedData(
    url="https://example.com",
    title="Example Domain",
    content="This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents."
)
```
Or in the case of an error:
```
ScrapedData(
    url="https://example.com",
    error="HTTP 404: Not Found"
)
```
