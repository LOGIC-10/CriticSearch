## ClassDef ToolRegistry
**ToolRegistry**: The function of ToolRegistry is to manage tools using their function names as keys, allowing for the retrieval or creation of schemas for these tools.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· _tools: A dictionary mapping function names (as strings) to their respective schemas (as dictionaries).

**Code Description**: The ToolRegistry class serves as a centralized registry for managing tool schemas, which are essential for the operation of various tools within the application. Upon initialization, it creates an empty dictionary, _tools, to store the schemas associated with different functions. 

The primary method of this class, get_or_create_tool_schema, accepts one or more functions as arguments. For each function, it checks if a schema already exists in the _tools dictionary. If a schema does not exist, it invokes the Tool.create_schema_from_function method to generate a new schema based on the provided function and stores it in the _tools dictionary. This method also logs the creation of new schemas for tracking purposes.

The ToolRegistry class is utilized by the BaseAgent class, which acts as a foundational component for intelligent agents in the project. The BaseAgent creates an instance of ToolRegistry to manage the schemas for various tools it employs, such as the search aggregator and content scraper. By leveraging the ToolRegistry, the BaseAgent can efficiently retrieve and utilize the necessary schemas for its operations, ensuring that the tools are correctly configured and ready for use.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the ToolRegistry is populated with the required schemas for the tools being used, as the functionality of the BaseAgent and its ability to perform tasks depend on these schemas being available.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value when retrieving schemas for a function might look like this:
```json
{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "function_name": "search",
      "schema": {
        "parameters": {
          "query": "string",
          "results": "list"
        },
        "description": "Schema for the search tool."
      }
    },
    {
      "function_name": "scrape",
      "schema": {
        "parameters": {
          "urls": "list",
          "content": "string"
        },
        "description": "Schema for the content scraper tool."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an empty registry for storing tool schemas.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method that is called when an instance of the ToolRegistry class is created. This function initializes an instance variable named _tools, which is a dictionary. The purpose of this dictionary is to map function names (as strings) to their respective schemas (as dictionaries). By initializing _tools as an empty dictionary, the function sets up a clean state for the ToolRegistry instance, allowing it to store tool schemas that can be added later. This design ensures that the registry starts without any pre-existing data, providing a fresh environment for subsequent operations.

**Note**: It is important to understand that this function does not take any parameters and does not return any value. It solely serves the purpose of setting up the initial state of the ToolRegistry instance. Users should ensure that the _tools dictionary is populated with valid tool schemas through other methods provided in the ToolRegistry class after the instance is initialized.

### FunctionDef get_or_create_tool_schema(self)
## Method: `get_or_create_tool_schema`

### Description:
The `get_or_create_tool_schema` method retrieves or creates tool schemas for the given functions. If the schema for a function is not already registered, it will be created using the `Tool.create_schema_from_function` method and added to the registry. This ensures that the necessary tool schemas are available for the provided functions.

### Parameters:
- `*target_functions` (Callable): One or more functions for which schemas are to be retrieved or created. The parameter accepts a variable number of function arguments.

### Returns:
- `List[Dict]`: A list of schemas corresponding to the provided functions. Each schema is returned as a dictionary.

### Behavior:
1. The method iterates through each provided function in `target_functions`.
2. For each function, it checks if its schema already exists in the registry (using the function's name).
3. If the schema is not registered:
   - The schema is created by calling `Tool.create_schema_from_function` with the target function.
   - The schema is added to the registry.
   - A log message is printed indicating the creation of the schema.
4. Finally, the method returns a list of schemas corresponding to the provided functions, whether they were newly created or retrieved from the registry.

### Example Usage:
```python
tool_registry = ToolRegistry()
schemas = tool_registry.get_or_create_tool_schema(function1, function2)
```

### Notes:
- The method leverages the `Tool.create_schema_from_function` to generate the schema when necessary.
- Logging of schema creation is handled by the `printer.log` function, providing feedback on the schema creation process.
