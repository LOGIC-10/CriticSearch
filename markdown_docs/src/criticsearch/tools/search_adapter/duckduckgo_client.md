## ClassDef DuckDuckGoClient
**DuckDuckGoClient**: The function of DuckDuckGoClient is to implement a search client that interacts with the DuckDuckGo search engine, providing search results based on specified query parameters.

**attributes**: 
- None.

**Code Description**: 
The `DuckDuckGoClient` class is a subclass of the `BaseSearchClient` class. It is specifically designed to perform search operations via DuckDuckGo's search engine. This class implements the asynchronous `search` method, which retrieves search results by sending a query to DuckDuckGo's API, processes the results, and returns a structured response.

The class contains the following key components:

1. **_convert_days_to_timelimit**: This helper method converts a specified number of days into DuckDuckGo's internal time limit format. It accepts an integer `days` as input and returns a string corresponding to one of the following time periods:
   - `"d"` for the last 24 hours
   - `"w"` for the last week
   - `"m"` for the last month
   - `"y"` for the last year
   The method is essential for formatting the time-related parameter when calling the DuckDuckGo search API.

2. **search**: This asynchronous method is responsible for sending a search query to DuckDuckGo's API. It accepts the following parameters:
   - `query`: A string representing the search query.
   - `days`: An optional integer that filters results to a specific time frame. It defaults to 7 (last week).
   - `max_results`: An optional integer specifying the maximum number of results to return. It defaults to 10.
   - `region`: A string that defines the search region. It can be `"us-en"` for the United States or `"cn-zh"` for China, with a default value of `"us-en"`.
   
   The method utilizes the `_convert_days_to_timelimit` helper to determine the time frame for the search, constructs a request to DuckDuckGo, and processes the response into a list of `SearchResult` objects. Each `SearchResult` contains the title, URL, and content of a search result. Finally, the method returns a `SearchResponse` object that contains the query and the processed search results, limited to the specified `max_results`.

3. **retry decorator**: The `search` method is wrapped with a retry decorator that handles retries in case of failures. The retry logic is configured to stop after 5 attempts (`stop_after_attempt(5)`) and apply an exponential backoff strategy with random jitter (`wait_exponential` and `wait_random`). The decorator specifically targets the `RatelimitException`, which is likely raised when the DuckDuckGo API is being rate-limited.

In terms of functionality, the `DuckDuckGoClient` integrates with the `AsyncDDGS` (asynchronous DuckDuckGo search) client, which is responsible for sending the query and receiving raw search results. These results are then transformed into a structured format suitable for further use in the system. 

**Note**: 
- The `search` method is asynchronous, so it must be awaited when called.
- The method supports time-based filtering, allowing users to retrieve results from the last 24 hours, week, month, or year.
- The retry logic ensures robustness in case of rate limiting or temporary failures in the API interaction.

**Output Example**:
A possible return value from the `search` method might look like this:

```json
{
  "query": "example search query",
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Example Result 1",
      "url": "https://www.example1.com",
      "content": "This is the content of the first search result."
    },
    {
      "title": "Example Result 2",
      "url": "https://www.example2.com",
      "content": "This is the content of the second search result."
    }
  ]
}
```
### FunctionDef _convert_days_to_timelimit(self, days)
**_convert_days_to_timelimit**: The function of _convert_days_to_timelimit is to convert a given number of days into a timelimit format used by DuckDuckGo's search client.

**parameters**:
· days: An integer representing the number of days to filter results.

**Code Description**:  
The function _convert_days_to_timelimit takes an integer value for `days` and returns a corresponding string representing DuckDuckGo's timelimit format. This format is used to filter search results based on the specified timeframe.

The function works as follows:
1. If the `days` value is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `"d"`, which stands for results from the last 24 hours.
2. If the `days` value is greater than 1 but less than or equal to 7, the function returns `"w"`, representing results from the last week.
3. If the `days` value is greater than 7 but less than or equal to 30, the function returns `"m"`, indicating results from the last month.
4. If the `days` value exceeds 30, the function returns `"y"`, indicating results from the last year.

This function is crucial for the `search` method within the `DuckDuckGoClient` class. Specifically, it is called to determine the appropriate timelimit format when initiating a search request. The `search` method passes the `days` argument to _convert_days_to_timelimit, which then returns the timelimit string to be used in the search query. The timelimit helps filter search results based on recency, allowing the user to retrieve results relevant to a specific timeframe.

**Note**: The `days` parameter should be an integer, and the function will return one of the following string values:
- `"d"` for the last 24 hours,
- `"w"` for the last week,
- `"m"` for the last month,
- `"y"` for the last year.

**Output Example**:
For `days = 3`, the output would be `"w"`, representing results from the last week.  
For `days = 40`, the output would be `"y"`, representing results from the last year.

### FunctionDef search(self, query, days, max_results, region)
**search**: The function of search is to perform an asynchronous search query using the DuckDuckGo search client and return the results in a structured format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· query: A string representing the search term to be queried.  
· days: An integer representing the number of days to filter results, defaulting to 7.  
· max_results: An integer indicating the maximum number of search results to return, defaulting to 10.  
· region: A string literal that specifies the region for the search results, defaulting to "us-en".  

**Code Description**: The `search` function is an asynchronous method designed to query the DuckDuckGo search engine. It accepts a search term (`query`) and several optional parameters that allow users to customize the search results based on recency and quantity.

1. The method begins by converting the `days` parameter into a timelimit format using the `_convert_days_to_timelimit` method. This conversion is crucial as it determines how recent the search results should be, based on the specified number of days.

2. A debug log statement is executed to indicate the initiation of a search query, providing visibility into the operation being performed.

3. The function then calls the `atext` method of the `AsyncDDGS` class, which is part of the DuckDuckGo search client. This method is awaited, meaning that the function will pause execution until the search results are retrieved. The parameters passed to `atext` include the search `query`, the `region`, a safesearch setting, the `timelimit`, and the maximum number of results to return.

4. Once the raw results are obtained, the function processes these results into a list of `SearchResult` objects. Each `SearchResult` is instantiated with the title, URL, and content extracted from the raw results.

5. Finally, the function returns a `SearchResponse` object that encapsulates the original query and the list of search results, limited to the specified `max_results`.

The `search` function is integral to the `DuckDuckGoClient` class, facilitating user queries and structuring the response in a way that is easy to consume by other components of the application. It relies on the `_convert_days_to_timelimit` method to filter results based on recency and utilizes the `SearchResult` and `SearchResponse` classes to format the output.

**Note**: 
- The `query` parameter is mandatory and should be a valid search term. 
- The `days`, `max_results`, and `region` parameters are optional and have default values, allowing for flexible usage.
- The function is asynchronous, which means it should be awaited when called to ensure proper execution flow.

**Output Example**: 
A possible return value of the `search` function could look like this:
```json
{
  "query": "Python programming",
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners",
      "url": "https://www.example.com/learn-python",
      "content": "This comprehensive course covers Python basics and advanced topics."
    },
    {
      "title": "Python Programming Language",
      "url": "https://www.example.com/python",
      "content": "Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity."
    }
  ]
}
```
