## ClassDef BingClient
**BingClient**: The function of BingClient is to serve as a client for the Bing Search API, facilitating search queries and handling responses.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· base_url: str - This attribute stores the base URL for the Bing Search API endpoint.
· _api_key: str - This attribute holds the API key required for authenticating requests to the Bing Search API.
· _client_name: str - This attribute defines the name of the client, which is "BingClient".

**Code Description**: The `BingClient` class is an implementation of the `BaseSearchClient`, specifically designed to interact with the Bing Search API. It initializes with an API key, which is essential for authenticating requests to the Bing service. The class defines a method `search`, which is an asynchronous function that takes a search query as input and returns a structured response containing search results.

Upon instantiation, the `BingClient` sets the `base_url` to the Bing Search API endpoint and stores the provided API key. The `search` method is decorated with a retry mechanism that allows it to attempt the request up to five times in case of a `RatelimitException`, which indicates that the rate limit for API requests has been exceeded. The retry logic employs exponential backoff combined with random jitter to manage the timing of retries effectively.

In the `search` method, an HTTP GET request is made to the Bing API using the `httpx.AsyncClient`. The request includes headers for authentication and parameters that specify the search query and additional options such as the number of results to return, safe search settings, and response filters. The method processes the API response, extracting relevant information from the JSON payload, and constructs a list of `SearchResult` objects that encapsulate the title, URL, and snippet of each search result.

The `BingClient` is utilized within the `SearchAggregator` class, which manages multiple search clients. When the `SearchAggregator` is initialized, it checks for the presence of the Bing API key in the settings. If the key is available, it creates an instance of `BingClient` and adds it to its collection of clients. This design allows the `SearchAggregator` to leverage the Bing search functionality alongside other search clients, providing a unified interface for executing search queries across different services.

**Note**: It is crucial to handle exceptions such as `RatelimitException` and `InvalidAPIKeyError` when using the `BingClient` to ensure robust error management and user experience. The `search` method should be called asynchronously to comply with its design.

A possible appearance of the code's return value from the `search` method could look like this:
```json
{
    "query": "fishing",
    "results": [
        {
            "title": "Fishing Tips and Techniques",
            "url": "https://www.example.com/fishing-tips",
            "content": "Learn the best fishing tips and techniques for a successful day on the water."
        },
        {
            "title": "Top Fishing Spots",
            "url": "https://www.example.com/top-fishing-spots",
            "content": "Discover the top fishing spots in your area for a great fishing experience."
        }
    ]
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, api_key)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the BingClient object with necessary configuration values.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· api_key: A string representing the API key required to authenticate the client with Bing's search API.

**Code Description**:  
The `__init__` method is a constructor function for the `BingClient` class. It is called when an instance of the class is created. This method performs the following actions:

1. It assigns a fixed string URL (`"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search"`) to the `base_url` attribute, which is the endpoint for Bing's search API. This URL will be used in API requests to interact with Bing's search service.
  
2. It stores the provided `api_key` parameter in a private attribute `_api_key`. This API key is essential for authenticating requests to Bing's API. The key is passed to the class upon instantiation, and it is stored for later use in making authorized API calls.

3. It initializes the `self._client_name` attribute with the string value `"BingClient"`. This can be used to identify the client or for logging purposes to track requests made by this client.

The constructor ensures that an instance of `BingClient` is ready for making authenticated API requests to the Bing search service.

**Note**: 
- The `api_key` parameter must be correctly provided when creating an instance of the `BingClient`, as it is required for API authentication.
- The `base_url` is fixed and does not change during the lifetime of the object, which makes it reusable for all API requests initiated from the same instance.

### FunctionDef search(self, query)
**search**: The function of search is to perform an asynchronous search query using the Bing search API and return the results encapsulated in a SearchResponse object.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· query: A string representing the user's search query. This parameter cannot be empty.

**Code Description**: The `search` function is an asynchronous method that interacts with the Bing search API to retrieve search results based on a specified query. It begins by setting the necessary headers, including the API key required for authentication. The function constructs a parameters dictionary that includes the search query, the number of results to return, safe search settings, and response filters.

The function utilizes the `httpx.AsyncClient` to send an asynchronous GET request to the Bing API endpoint. The response is awaited, and upon receiving a successful status code (200), the function processes the JSON response. It extracts the relevant search results from the response, specifically focusing on the "webPages" section. Each result is then instantiated as a `SearchResult` object, which includes the title, URL, and content snippet of the search result.

If the response indicates a rate limit error (status code 429), the function raises a `RatelimitException`. If the API key is invalid (status code 401), it raises an `InvalidAPIKeyError`. For any other unexpected status codes, the function returns a `SearchResponse` object that includes the query and an error message detailing the unexpected status.

This function is called by the `_search_single_query` method in the `SearchAggregator` class. The `_search_single_query` method iterates through a list of available search engines and attempts to execute the `search` function for each engine. If the search is successful, it logs the result and returns it. In case of exceptions such as `RetryError`, `InvalidAPIKeyError`, or `UsageLimitExceededError`, the method handles these by marking the engine as unavailable and logging the appropriate error messages.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the query parameter is not empty when calling this function, as it will lead to an error. Additionally, proper handling of the exceptions raised by this function is crucial for maintaining the robustness of the application, especially in scenarios where API limits or invalid keys may affect search operations.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the `search` function could be a `SearchResponse` object structured as follows:
```python
SearchResponse(
    query="fishing",
    results=[
        SearchResult(title="Fishing Tips", url="https://example.com/fishing-tips", content="Learn the best tips for fishing."),
        SearchResult(title="Fishing Gear", url="https://example.com/fishing-gear", content="Find the best gear for your fishing adventures.")
    ],
    error_message=None
)
```
