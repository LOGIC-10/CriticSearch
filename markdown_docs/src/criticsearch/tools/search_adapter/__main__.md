## FunctionDef main
## Function Documentation: `main`

### Overview:
The `main` function serves as the entry point for executing a search query using the `SearchAggregator` class. It is an asynchronous function that initializes the search aggregator, performs a search, and prints the results.

### Function Signature:
```python
async def main()
```

### Description:
The `main` function is responsible for initiating the search process by utilizing the `SearchAggregator` class to handle search queries. It performs the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: The function first creates an instance of the `SearchAggregator` class, which is used to manage and execute searches across multiple available search engines.

2. **Search Execution**: It calls the `search` method of the `SearchAggregator` instance, passing a list of queries. In this case, the query is a single string: `"Who is Leo Messi?"`.

3. **Results Handling**: After executing the search, the function awaits the response from the `search` method. The results are then printed to the console.

### Purpose:
The function provides an example of how to interact with the `SearchAggregator` class to perform searches. It demonstrates the process of query submission and result handling within an asynchronous context.

### Parameters:
This function does not accept any parameters.

### Execution Flow:
1. An instance of the `SearchAggregator` is created.
2. The `search` method of the `SearchAggregator` is called with a predefined query.
3. The search results are printed to the console.

### Example Output:
```json
{
  "responses": [
    {
      "query": "Who is Leo Messi?",
      "results": [
        {
          "title": "Lionel Messi - Wikipedia",
          "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi",
          "snippet": "Lionel Andr√©s Messi is an Argentine professional footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Notes:
- The function demonstrates basic usage of the `SearchAggregator` class, performing an asynchronous search and printing the response.
- The search query used in this example is predefined, but in a real-world scenario, queries could be dynamic, and multiple queries could be passed to the `search` method concurrently.
