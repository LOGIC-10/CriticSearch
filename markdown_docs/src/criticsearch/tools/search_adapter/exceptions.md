## ClassDef SearchClientError
**SearchClientError**: The function of SearchClientError is to define a base exception class for errors related to the search client.

**attributes**:
· message: str - This attribute stores the error message that is associated with the exception.

**Code Description**:  
The `SearchClientError` class is a custom exception that extends Python's built-in `Exception` class. It is used as a base class for specific error types related to the search client functionality. The class constructor (`__init__`) accepts a message parameter, which defaults to "An error occurred in the search client." This message is passed to the parent `Exception` class using `super().__init__(message)`, enabling the `SearchClientError` instance to store and propagate the message to whoever handles the exception.

The class is intended to be subclassed by other specific error classes that need to indicate particular search client-related errors, such as exceeded usage limits, bad requests, or invalid API keys. In the project, we can see that multiple exceptions inherit from `SearchClientError`, such as `UsageLimitExceededError`, `BadRequestError`, `InvalidAPIKeyError`, `RatelimitException`, and `TimeoutException`. Each of these subclasses customizes the default error message to reflect a more specific error condition, but they all share the same base behavior provided by `SearchClientError`. 

The subclasses inherit the core functionality of the `SearchClientError` class, while modifying the error message for clarity and relevance to the particular situation. These subclasses ensure that the search client exceptions are appropriately handled in different cases, providing clear and specific error messages to the developers working with the search client.

**Note**:  
- The `SearchClientError` class serves as a foundational class for defining more granular exception types.
- It is important that any custom error related to the search client extend from `SearchClientError` to maintain consistency across the project.
- The default message can be overridden when raising exceptions, but the base class guarantees that a message is always available, which helps in debugging and troubleshooting.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the SearchClientError class with a specified error message.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: A string that represents the error message to be displayed. It defaults to "An error occurred in the search client."

**Code Description**: This __init__ function is a constructor for the SearchClientError class, which is likely a custom exception class used to handle errors related to a search client in the application. The function takes one optional parameter, `message`, which allows the user to specify a custom error message. If no message is provided when an instance of the class is created, the default message "An error occurred in the search client." will be used. The constructor calls the `__init__` method of its superclass (presumably a built-in exception class) using `super().__init__(message)`, which initializes the base class with the provided message. This ensures that the error message is properly set up for the exception handling mechanism in Python.

**Note**: It is important to provide a meaningful error message when raising this exception to facilitate debugging and error tracking. Users of this class should be aware that the default message may not always convey the specific issue encountered, so customizing the message is recommended when applicable.
***
## ClassDef UsageLimitExceededError
**UsageLimitExceededError**: The function of UsageLimitExceededError is to indicate that the usage limit for the search client has been exceeded.

**attributes**:
· message: str - This attribute stores the error message that is associated with the exception.

**Code Description**: The `UsageLimitExceededError` class is a custom exception that inherits from the `SearchClientError` base class. It is specifically designed to handle scenarios where the usage limit of the search client has been surpassed. The constructor of the `UsageLimitExceededError` class accepts a single parameter, `message`, which defaults to "Usage limit exceeded." This message provides a clear indication of the error condition when the exception is raised.

When an instance of `UsageLimitExceededError` is created, it calls the constructor of its parent class, `SearchClientError`, using `super().__init__(message)`. This ensures that the error message is properly initialized and can be accessed by any exception handling mechanisms that catch this specific error.

In the context of the project, the `UsageLimitExceededError` is utilized within the `search` method of the `TavilyClient` class. When a search request is made and the server responds with a status code of 429, indicating that the usage limit has been exceeded, the `UsageLimitExceededError` is raised. This allows the error to propagate up the call stack, where it can be handled appropriately, such as logging the error and marking the search engine as unavailable.

Additionally, the `UsageLimitExceededError` is caught in the `_search_single_query` method of the `SearchAggregator` class. When this exception is encountered, it logs a warning message indicating that the engine has failed due to the usage limit being exceeded and subsequently marks the engine as unavailable. This structured approach to error handling ensures that the application can gracefully manage situations where the search client cannot fulfill requests due to usage constraints.

**Note**: 
- The `UsageLimitExceededError` class is intended to be used specifically for signaling that the search client's usage limit has been reached.
- It is essential to handle this exception in the calling code to maintain robust error management and provide meaningful feedback to users or developers regarding the state of the search client.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the UsageLimitExceededError class with a specific error message.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: A string that represents the error message to be displayed when the exception is raised. It defaults to "Usage limit exceeded."

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the UsageLimitExceededError class, which is a custom exception that inherits from the built-in Exception class. When an instance of UsageLimitExceededError is created, this method is called to set up the instance. The method takes one optional parameter, message, which allows the user to specify a custom error message. If no message is provided, it defaults to "Usage limit exceeded." The constructor then calls the constructor of the parent class (Exception) using super().__init__(message), which initializes the base class with the provided message. This ensures that the error message is properly stored and can be accessed when the exception is raised.

**Note**: It is important to provide a meaningful message when raising this exception to ensure that the context of the error is clear to the user. If the default message is used, it may not provide sufficient information about the specific situation that caused the exception.
***
## ClassDef BadRequestError
**BadRequestError**: The function of BadRequestError is to represent an exception that occurs when a bad request is made to the search client.

**attributes**:
· message: str - This attribute stores the error message that is associated with the exception. The default message is "Bad request."

**Code Description**:  
The `BadRequestError` class is a custom exception that extends the `SearchClientError` base exception class. This class is designed to handle errors that arise specifically from a bad request made to the search client. It inherits the core functionality of `SearchClientError`, which means it can propagate an error message and be caught by any exception handling mechanism designed to manage `SearchClientError` exceptions.

The constructor of the `BadRequestError` class accepts a message parameter, which has a default value of "Bad request." If no message is provided, this default message will be used when raising the exception. The message is passed to the parent class `SearchClientError` using `super().__init__(message)`, ensuring that the error message is properly stored and can be accessed by the exception handler.

As a subclass of `SearchClientError`, the `BadRequestError` inherits the attributes and behaviors of its parent, but it customizes the default message to indicate that the error specifically pertains to a bad request. This helps in distinguishing it from other types of errors in the search client, such as those related to invalid API keys, rate limits, or usage limits.

In terms of functionality, the `BadRequestError` is useful for handling scenarios where the client makes a request that the search service cannot process due to an issue with the request itself (such as invalid parameters or incorrect syntax). The error message provides clarity about the nature of the issue, assisting developers in debugging and resolving the problem.

**Note**:  
- The `BadRequestError` class is intended to be raised when a bad request is made to the search client, providing a clear and specific error message.
- This class inherits from `SearchClientError`, so it benefits from the structure and behavior defined in the base class.
- The default message for this exception can be overridden when raising the exception, but the base class ensures that an appropriate message is always available.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the BadRequestError class with a specified error message.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· message: A string that represents the error message to be associated with the BadRequestError instance. It defaults to "Bad request." if no message is provided.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the BadRequestError class, which is likely a custom exception class used to indicate that a client has made a bad request to a server or an API. This function takes one optional parameter, message, which allows the user to specify a custom error message. If the user does not provide a message, the default value "Bad request." is used. The function then calls the constructor of its superclass (presumably Exception or a subclass thereof) using super().__init__(message), which initializes the base class with the provided message. This ensures that the error message is properly set up for the exception handling mechanism in Python.

**Note**: It is important to provide meaningful error messages when raising exceptions to facilitate debugging and improve the user experience. Users of this class should be aware that the message parameter is optional, but providing a specific message can help clarify the nature of the error encountered.
***
## ClassDef InvalidAPIKeyError
**InvalidAPIKeyError**: The function of InvalidAPIKeyError is to define a specific exception that signals an invalid API key error.

**attributes**:
· message: str - This attribute stores the error message associated with the exception.

**Code Description**:  
The `InvalidAPIKeyError` class is a custom exception that extends from the `SearchClientError` base exception class. It is specifically designed to handle errors related to invalid API keys when interacting with a search engine client. This class inherits the functionality of the `SearchClientError` class, ensuring that it shares the same message handling mechanism, but it customizes the error message to indicate that the error is due to an invalid API key.

The constructor of the `InvalidAPIKeyError` class accepts an optional `message` parameter that defaults to "Invalid API key." If no specific message is provided when the exception is raised, this default message is used. The constructor calls the parent class's (`SearchClientError`) constructor using `super().__init__(message)`, allowing the error message to be passed to the parent class, which ensures consistent exception handling and message propagation throughout the system.

This class is primarily used within the project to signal when an API key used for making requests to a search engine is invalid. It is invoked in the `search` methods of different client classes like `BingClient` and `TavilyClient`. For example, in the case of a 401 HTTP status code (Unauthorized), the `InvalidAPIKeyError` is raised to indicate that the API key is incorrect. Once raised, it can be caught and handled appropriately by the surrounding code, such as marking the search engine as unavailable, as seen in the `SearchAggregator` class.

In the project, this exception serves as a clear and specific indicator of issues related to invalid API keys, providing a more precise understanding of the problem than more generic error messages.

**Note**:  
- The `InvalidAPIKeyError` class is a subclass of `SearchClientError`, ensuring it follows the same error-handling structure as other search client exceptions.
- This exception should be used whenever an invalid API key is encountered in the system, providing consistency in error reporting and debugging.
- The default message can be customized by providing a different `message` value when raising the exception, but the base message is helpful for general use cases.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the InvalidAPIKeyError class, setting a custom error message.

**parameters**:
· message: str (default value: "Invalid API key.") - A string message that is used to describe the error.

**Code Description**:  
The __init__ method in this class is responsible for initializing an instance of the InvalidAPIKeyError exception. It inherits from the built-in Exception class, and its purpose is to provide a custom error message when an invalid API key is encountered. 

When an instance of InvalidAPIKeyError is created, the method first checks if a custom message has been provided by the caller. If no message is given, it defaults to "Invalid API key." This message is then passed to the parent class' constructor using `super().__init__(message)`, which ensures that the Exception class is properly initialized with the message string. This allows the InvalidAPIKeyError to carry the custom or default error message when raised.

**Note**:  
- The message parameter is optional. If not provided, the default message "Invalid API key." will be used.
- The super() function is used to call the parent class constructor (Exception) to ensure that the error message is properly handled by the base Exception class.
***
## ClassDef RatelimitException
**RatelimitException**: The function of RatelimitException is to indicate that the rate limit for API requests has been exceeded.

**attributes**:
· message: str - This attribute stores the error message that is associated with the exception.

**Code Description**: The `RatelimitException` class is a custom exception that inherits from the `SearchClientError` base class. It is specifically designed to handle scenarios where the rate limit for API requests has been exceeded. The constructor of `RatelimitException` accepts a message parameter, which defaults to "Rate limit exceeded." This message is passed to the parent class `SearchClientError` using `super().__init__(message)`, ensuring that the exception carries a relevant error message when raised.

In the context of the project, `RatelimitException` is utilized within the `BingClient` and `TavilyClient` classes, which are responsible for interacting with their respective search APIs. When a request to these APIs results in a 429 HTTP status code, which signifies that the rate limit has been reached, the `RatelimitException` is raised. This allows the application to handle the situation appropriately, such as by implementing retry logic or notifying the user of the issue.

The `RatelimitException` serves as a clear indication to developers that the application has encountered a rate limiting issue, allowing for better error handling and user experience. It is part of a broader hierarchy of exceptions that extend from `SearchClientError`, which includes other specific error types like `UsageLimitExceededError` and `InvalidAPIKeyError`. Each of these exceptions provides a way to manage different error conditions that may arise while interacting with search client functionalities.

**Note**: 
- It is essential to handle `RatelimitException` in the application logic to ensure that the user is informed of the rate limit issue and that appropriate measures are taken, such as retrying the request after a delay.
- The default message can be overridden if a more specific message is required when raising the exception, but the base functionality ensures that a message is always available for debugging purposes.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a RatelimitException instance with a specific error message.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the RatelimitException class, which is likely a custom exception used to indicate that a rate limit has been exceeded in an application. When an instance of RatelimitException is created, it calls the constructor of its superclass (presumably Exception) using the super() function, passing the message parameter to it. This ensures that the base exception class is properly initialized with the provided message. If no message is specified when the exception is raised, it defaults to "Rate limit exceeded," providing a clear indication of the error condition.

**Note**: It is important to provide a meaningful message when raising this exception to ensure that the context of the error is clear to the developers or users handling the exception.
***
## ClassDef TimeoutException
**TimeoutException**: The function of TimeoutException is to represent an error that occurs when a timeout condition is encountered in the search client operations.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· message: str - This attribute stores the error message that is associated with the exception, defaulting to "Timeout occurred."

**Code Description**: The `TimeoutException` class is a custom exception that extends the `SearchClientError` class. It is specifically designed to handle timeout errors that may arise during the execution of search client operations. When an instance of `TimeoutException` is created, it invokes the constructor of its parent class, `SearchClientError`, passing a default message that indicates a timeout has occurred. This allows the exception to carry a meaningful message that can be used for debugging and error handling.

The `TimeoutException` class inherits all the properties and methods of the `SearchClientError` class, which serves as a base for various search client-related exceptions. By extending `SearchClientError`, `TimeoutException` ensures that it maintains a consistent structure and behavior with other exceptions in the search client domain, such as `UsageLimitExceededError`, `BadRequestError`, and others. This design promotes a clear hierarchy of exceptions, making it easier for developers to handle specific error cases effectively.

In practical terms, when a timeout occurs during a search operation, the `TimeoutException` can be raised to signal this specific issue. Developers can catch this exception in their code to implement appropriate error handling strategies, such as retrying the operation, logging the error, or notifying users of the timeout condition.

**Note**: 
- It is essential to use `TimeoutException` in scenarios where a timeout is a relevant error condition, ensuring that the error handling is precise and informative.
- The default message can be customized when raising the exception, but it is advisable to maintain clarity regarding the nature of the timeout error for effective debugging and user communication.
