## ClassDef BaseSearchClient
**BaseSearchClient**: The function of BaseSearchClient is to define the structure and interface for search clients. 

**attributes**: 
- There are no attributes in this class.

**Code Description**: 
The `BaseSearchClient` class is an abstract base class, designed to be inherited by other search client classes that implement specific search API integrations. It contains a single abstract method, `search`, which must be implemented by any subclass. The method signature specifies that `search` should be an asynchronous method that accepts a `query` string and potentially other keyword arguments (`kwargs`) to allow flexibility. The return type for `search` is expected to be any type, which provides a broad scope for returning various formats of search responses depending on the specific implementation in the subclasses.

This class does not implement any functionality itself; it serves as a contract for all subclasses that handle search functionality. Subclasses such as `BingClient`, `DuckDuckGoClient`, and `TavilyClient` inherit from `BaseSearchClient` and implement the `search` method to interact with specific search engines. These subclasses are responsible for providing the actual logic for sending search requests, handling responses, and structuring the search results.

The `BaseSearchClient` class is crucial in this context as it standardizes the interface for search functionality, allowing the rest of the system to interact with any specific search engine implementation in a uniform way, without needing to worry about the underlying details of the API being used. Any object or module in the system that relies on search results can use `BaseSearchClient` as the reference for interacting with any subclass that implements the `search` method.

**Note**: 
- The `BaseSearchClient` class is not intended to be instantiated directly. It is meant to be subclassed, and the `search` method should be implemented in those subclasses to provide the actual search functionality.
- This class enforces the asynchronous nature of search operations, ensuring that any subclass providing the `search` method must handle asynchronous behavior.
### FunctionDef search(self, query)
**search**: The function of search is to asynchronously process a search query and return the result.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· query: A string representing the search query to be executed.
· kwargs: A variable number of additional keyword arguments, which may provide further customization or configuration for the search operation.

**Code Description**: 
The `search` function is defined as an asynchronous method, which implies that it will likely handle operations that may take time to complete, such as making network requests or querying a database. The function signature takes in two parameters: `query` and `kwargs`. 
- The `query` parameter is a required string that holds the search term or phrase the function will process.
- The `kwargs` parameter allows for the inclusion of additional keyword arguments, which could be used for supplementary parameters such as pagination, filters, or sorting criteria in the search operation.

However, the function body itself is currently not implemented, which means it lacks the specific logic to execute the search and return results. The `pass` statement indicates that this function is a placeholder or is intended to be overridden in a subclass or future implementation. The function is defined to return a result of type `Any`, indicating that the return type is flexible and could be adjusted based on the actual implementation.

**Note**: 
- The `search` function is expected to be part of an asynchronous workflow, so it should be awaited when called in an asynchronous context.
- The behavior and utility of the `kwargs` parameter are not defined here and would depend on the actual implementation of the method.
