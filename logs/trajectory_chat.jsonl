After the Assad regime’s downfall, Jordan, through its officials, expressed its readiness “to provide any assistance needed by the brotherly Syrian people.” Jordan fears that Syria might “slide into chaos,” a scenario that poses a major concern for maintaining security and stability within Jordan itself. While the fall of Assad’s regime worked in Israel’s favor by disrupting the Iran-Hezbollah supply corridor and curbing Iranian influence near its borders, it has remained wary of the implications of Islamist control in Syria.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[6]:\nTITLE: Analysis: What Syria's reignited civil war means for the Middle East\nURL: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/analysis-what-syrias-reignited-civil-war-means-for-the-middle-east\nCONTENT: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/analysis-what-syrias-reignited-civil-war-means-for-the-middle-east During the height of the conflict in Syria nearly a decade ago, Aleppo was divided between government-controlled and rebel areas, but with the help of Russian airpower and the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad was able to regain control over the entire city by the end of 2016.

Resolving this dilemma requires the new Syrian government to take several steps, including: providing international guarantees not to deal with groups designated as terrorists; implementing effective policies to combat violent extremism and ensure the state’s monopoly on weapons; enhancing transparency in the management of international aid; and opening up to individuals from the civil political and opposition forces that have a role in running the government to rebuild international confidence and gradually lift economic sanctions.\n--------------------------------------------------", "done": false, "remarks": "Tool call success: search"}

Fighters from various rebel factions, including a group linked to Al Qaeda called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, had advanced by Wednesday to within about six miles of Aleppo and taken over weapons and vehicles previously held by forces loyal to the government of President Bashar al-Assad, according to the monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. “Pro-regime militias have been upping their attacks in the area, trying to deter the rebels because Israel has been weakening the Syrian regime’s allies like Hezbollah and Iran,” said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[3]:\nTITLE: The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an ...\nURL: https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and\nCONTENT: The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an opportunity for Turkey and a challenge for Russia | OSW Centre for Eastern Studies The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an opportunity for Turkey and a challenge for Russia In recent days, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reportedly visited Moscow, while the leaders of Russia and Iran engaged in telephone discussions, as did the foreign ministers of these countries and Turkey.

Resolving this dilemma requires the new Syrian government to take several steps, including: providing international guarantees not to deal with groups designated as terrorists; implementing effective policies to combat violent extremism and ensure the state’s monopoly on weapons; enhancing transparency in the management of international aid; and opening up to individuals from the civil political and opposition forces that have a role in running the government to rebuild international confidence and gradually lift economic sanctions.\n--------------------------------------------------", "action_taken": "<tool_use>\n  <name>scrape</name>\n  <arguments>{\"urls\": [\"https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/17/domestic-regional-and-international-reactions-to-the-syrian-revolution/\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>", "reward_received": 1.0, "next_observation": "URL: https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/17/domestic-regional-and-international-reactions-to-the-syrian-revolution/\nTitle: None\nContent:\nDomestic, Regional, and International Reactions to the Syrian Revolution\n\nDomestic, Regional, and International Reactions to the Syrian Revolution\n\nMohamad Fawaz  Mehmet Emin Cengiz        17 December 2024\n\nPosition Paper / Syria, Iraq, Israel / Regional Politics\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe Syrian regime’s 61-year-old tyranny has finally fallen. The country’s new rulers have been trying to pave the way for a political transitional process. Regional countries also do not stay idle in this new period. Some regional countries have already started engaging in political talks with HTS and its allies through the Department of Political Affairs of the new government in the country. So far, meetings have been held with ambassadors of Iraq, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt, UAE, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Italy. It was also announced that Qatar would soon open its embassy in Damascus.\n\nIt is safe to say that following the December 8th Revolution, Iran (and its proxies) emerged as the biggest losers along with the deposed Assad regime after the sweeping offensive led by HTS and Türkiye-backed Syrian rebels started on November 27th and ended on December 8th. Russia’s influence in the country has also shrunk. Nonetheless, it is still in a better position than Iran.\n\nIn an environment where developments are unfolding rapidly, it is essential to enumerate and understand the stances of Syrian, regional, and global actors to forecast what may come next.\n\nSyrian Actors:\n\nAfter the revolution, Syria is de facto divided into two main axes: Opposition forces (the new administration in Damascus) and the Syrian Democratic Forces. The new government controls approximately 70 percent of the country, while SDF controls around 30 percent. The SDF was expelled from Western Euphrates (Tel Rıf’at and Manbij) through the Türkiye-backed Syrian National Army’s ‘Operation Freedom Dawn’. In addition, the SDF withdrew from the Western Bank of Deir ez-Zour after the local Arab population revolted against it. In the upcoming period, the Arab-populated Eastern Syria will likely face new revolts, leading to the shrinking of the SDF control zones. New clashes between the SNA forces and SDF seem to be underway. A wing from the SDF’s Deir Ez-Zour Military Council also defected from it and joined the HTS-allied coalition. That said, SDF is trying to reach out to Damascus and cut a deal with HTS. By deciding to raise the flag of revolution, the SDF is trying to reconcile with HTS in the post-Assad regime era.\n\nOn the other side, the HTS-backed Syrian Salvation Government’s Prime Minister Mohammad Bashir has been appointed as the transitional period Prime Minister in the country, with a mandate that will expire on March 1, 2025. The transitional Prime Minister has already met with the HTS-backed Salvation Government’s and the ousted regime’s ministers in a meeting.\n\nAlthough the situation on the ground seems to be on track among the new rulers of Syria, it is beyond doubt that they will vie for power in the upcoming period. Thus, a challenging period is ahead. And the new government has no option but to share power among different actors.\n\nRegional Actors:\n\nTürkiye\n\nTürkiye emerged as the primary winner in the recent developments. The triumph of the new rulers of Syria is likely to incentivize a big chunk of the Syrian refugees in Türkiye to return to their homeland. Moreover, Türkiye also found the chance to clear SDF from the Western Euphrates, and it is now doubling down to do the same in the Eastern Euphrates in an effort to guarantee the safety of its southern borders due to the threats it has been perceiving from the SDF. Türkiye will also likely increase its trade activities with Syria as the dust settles slowly in the upcoming period.\n\nDiplomatically, Türkiye was also the first country to send its officials to Damascus. The Turkish Intelligence Chief Ibrahim Kalın visited Damascus and held meetings with the new faces of the government in Damascus. Additionally, Türkiye has appointed Burhan Köroğlu as the charge d’affaires to Damascus, and opened its embassy after 12 years of hiatus.\n\nIran\n\nIran is undoubtedly the biggest loser in recent events. Iranian influence and investments through the sectarian militias and billions of dollars that Tehran has invested in Syria have evaporated during the lightning offensive. As a result, Tehran abandoned Bashar al-Assad to its fate following the blows that it had to deal with in the aftermath of the repercussions of the 7th of October. The Iranian officials continue to frame the revolution in Syria as an American-Israeli plot. Moreover, they also interchangeably accuse the Syrian regime, Türkiye, and Russia.\n\nAlthough Iran has softened the rhetoric towards the new rulers of Syria, it is implausible that the new government in Syria will have a positive relationship with Iran due to Tehran’s track record of destroying Syria by supporting al-Assad via IRGC and Shiite militias from many countries including Afghanistan and Pakistan. Nonetheless, Iranian officials still claim that they got guarantees from the new administration in Damascus regarding the security of their embassy. Thus, they are willing to reopen it soon.\n\nIraq\n\nIn recent years, amid a series of political and regional shifts, Iraq has adopted a more introspective approach, leaning toward disengagement from external conflicts.\n\nIraqi officials have increasingly focused on preventing the spillover effects of the Syrian conflict from impacting their own country. As part of this strategy, Iraq has closed its borders with Syria to limit potential security threats, particularly following the arrival of around 4,000 Syrian soldiers who fled their military service. Various Iraqi factions remain on edge as they await new political leadership in Syria while maintaining a cautious stance by avoiding direct involvement in regional power struggles.\n\nThis cautious approach reflects the socio-economic internal fatigue and broader regional trends, such as Iran’s setbacks, which affected its proxies in the region in their regional role as well as their domestic power.\n\nLebanon\n\nOn the official front, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has called for Lebanon to distance itself from the Syrian conflict and to secure its borders at a time when the country has yet to recover from its war with Israel, and the ceasefire agreement remains fragile. After ensuring stability in the south, the Lebanese hope that the upcoming presidential election, scheduled for January 9th, will pave the way for recovery and the restoration of institutional order, beginning with the election of a president.\n\nHowever, the fall of the Syrian regime is expected to embolden the Lebanese opposition forces against Hezbollah and its allies, reflecting a regional weakening of the organization. In response, Hezbollah is likely to cling more firmly to its socio-political role in Lebanon, seeing it as its last chance. This dynamic suggests that Lebanon is poised for a period of political tension and power struggles before reaching stability as the political landscape is reshaped to reflect the shifting balance of regional power. On the other hand, focus is expected to increase on the return of Syrian refugees, who number more than two million, as the reasons for their displacement have diminished.\n\nJordan\n\nJordan initially supported the Assad regime during the Syrian rebels’ offensive. Later, it changed the rhetoric and welcomed the change in the country. Also, the Jordanian ambassador in Damascus met with the new rulers of Syria.\n\nMany Arab countries fear the return of the specter of the uprisings or a second rise of the Islamists that could threaten their rule, similar to the initial rise following the Arab Spring revolts.\n\nFor Jordan, in addition to these fears, its primary focus regarding Syria over the past years has been controlling borders and halting smuggling operations, a goal it has pursued through engagement with the Assad regime without achieving the desired outcomes. After the Assad regime’s downfall, Jordan, through its officials, expressed its readiness “to provide any assistance needed by the brotherly Syrian people.” Jordan fears that Syria might “slide into chaos,” a scenario that poses a major concern for maintaining security and stability within Jordan itself. In addition, Jordan has not hidden its concerns, as expressed by its officials, about the Israeli advances in Syria, which naturally represent a threat to Jordan’s security. Therefore, it is expected to see more significant Jordanian engagement with Syria’s new rulers, especially regarding border issues.\n\nEgypt\n\nEgypt’s response to the fall of the Syrian regime was cautious and delayed. When it came, the Egyptian Foreign Minister described the situation as a “change” and affirmed Egypt’s willingness to assist in easing the suffering of the Syrian people, supporting safe refugee returns, and participating in reconstruction efforts.\n\nAs a leading opponent of political Islam, Egypt remains deeply concerned about the transformation in Syria, fearing a second Arab spring wave, especially with Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group, at the forefront of the change in Syria. Also, the Egyptian leaders fear the potential spread of jihadist movements, which could threaten its governance or compromise national security.\n\nDespite economic challenges, Egypt has faced relatively fewer issues with its Syrian refugee population than other nations. However, it sees an opportunity to strengthen its economy and reclaim some of the regional influence it has lost in recent years by supporting refugee returns and participating in reconstruction efforts. Amidst these fears, the Egyptian ambassador met with the new administration officials in Syria.\n\nIsrael\n\nIsrael has maintained a military-centric approach to its view of the region. While the fall of Assad’s regime worked in Israel’s favor by disrupting the Iran-Hezbollah supply corridor and curbing Iranian influenc[TOO LONG, END]\n", "done": false, "remarks": "Tool call success: scrape"}

2024 Syrian Rebel Offensive and the Resulting Collapse of the Regime Military in Northern Syria - Oryx\n\nHome\nContact\n\n\nSaturday, 7 December 2024\n \nA 3-day SMO Done Right - 2024 Syrian Rebel Offensive and the Resulting Collapse of the Regime Military in Northern Syria\nJakub Janovsky Saturday, December 07, 2024 0 Comments\n\nBy Elmustek in collaboration with Jakub Janovsky and Buschlaid\nThe Syrian rebel offensive which commenced late on the 27th of November 2024 on positions of the Syrian Arab Army (SyAA) and affiliated forces collapsed regime positions throughout Idlib and Aleppo governorates, leading to the rout of government forces in both regions and allowing rebel forces to capture large amout of territory containing the city of Aleppo, multiple towns, and countless villages. \nWhile we for now dont know how far will rebels be able to advance, they are already at the gates of Hama city as of the time this article is being written. This massive rebel advance has resulted in incredible regime material losses - with almost all equipment being captured, not destroyed - making its losses extra painful for the regime and its allies (Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah) because now all those captured weapons and munitions can be used against their former owners.\nThis is only the latest case of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) being the biggest supplier of weapons and ammo to the forces it has been fighting. But the amount of equipment and munitions captured from the regime forces during this rout from Aleppo and Idlib governorates has been unprecedented. And it isnt just quantity of weapons - rebel captures include a whole collection of powerful and complex weapons like fighter jets (even if only some of the captured ones are likely operational), long range MRLS, and SAM systems. While using these weapons systems will be difficult for rebels, if they mamage to make operational even just some of them, it would pose a serious problem for the regime military and its allies.\nA detailed list of the destroyed and captured heavy weapons can be seen below.  \nThis list only includes captured vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available. Therefore, the amount of equipment destroyed or captured by Syrian rebel forces is undoubtedly higher than recorded here. Losses of trucks, jeeps, etc. might be added later. Small arms and munitions are not included in this list to preserve the sanity of people documenting regime losses.  \nThis list will be updated as additional footage becomes available.\nNote: this list will at least for now list only equipment losses that happened on or before the regime collapse in Hama on December 5th 2024 - depending on the later events, this list might later be expanded, but if the regime falls, there would be no point in listing literally everything that the regimes military osed to own.\n(Click on the numbers to get a picture of each individual captured or destroyed

He added that insurgents were headed from southern Syria toward the city.\n\nLone suspect charged with murdering two Israeli embassy staff in shooting near Jewish museum in Washington\n\nMore than 350 lawyers and academics say Government not complying with international law obligations over Palestine crisis\n\nAid trucks enter Gaza after delays as pressure mounts on Israel\n\nNetanyahu’s promise of Israel’s ‘total victory’ over Hamas is likely to remain elusive dream\n\nThe rebels, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militant group, earlier said they had reached the edge of the central city of Homs as government forces attempted to buttress collapsing front lines and preserve Bashar al-Assad’s 24-year rule. Syria’s state news agency denied rumours that Assad has left the country, saying he is at work in Damascus.\n\nThe leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a former al Qaeda affiliate, said in a video message on Saturday that the rebels were “in the final moments of liberating” Homs.\n\nSince the rebels’ sweep into Aleppo a week ago, government defences have crumbled across the country at dizzying speed as insurgents rose up in places where the rebellion had long seemed over. Besides capturing Aleppo in the north, Hama in the centre and Deir al-Zor in the east, rebels took contol of Suweida and Deraa.\n\nSyria’s military said it was carrying out air strikes around Hama and Homs and reinforcing on that front. It also said it was repositioning around Deraa and Suweida, without acknowledging their capture by rebels.\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday it was inadmissible to allow what he called a terrorist group to take control of Syrian lands. He was speaking in Doha, Qatar after meeting the Turkish and Iranian foreign ministers.\n\nRussia, a long-term ally of Syria, intervened in 2015 to prop up Damascus during Syria’s civil war, which began in 2011. It maintains a military presence in Syria, including a naval base and airbases in the cities of Tartus and Latakia, in the coastal region that is a stronghold of Assad’s Alawite sect.\n\nMr Lavrov said Russia would “help the Syrian army to counter the attacks of terrorists”.\n\nThe UN’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called for urgent talks to ensure an “orderly political transition”.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the annual Doha Forum, he said the talks in Geneva, Switzerland would discuss the implementation of a UN resolution that called for a Syrian-led political process. Resolution 2254, adopted in 2015, called for the establishment of a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with UN-supervised elections.\n\nThe pace of events in Syria has stunned Arab capitals, western officials say, raising their fears of a fresh wave of regional instability.\n\nSyria's civil war, which erupted in 2011 as an uprising against Assad's rule, dragged in big outside powers, created space for jihadist militants to plot attacks around the world and sent millions of refugees into neighbouring states.\n\nAssad had long relied on allies to subdue the rebels, with Russian warplanes bombing from the skies while Iran sent allied forces including Lebanon’s Hizbullah and Iraqi militia to bolster the Syrian military and storm insurgent strongholds.\n\nBut Russia has been focused on the war in Ukraine since 2022 and Hizbullah’s leadership has been decimated this year in its own gruelling war with Israel.\n\nHizbullah sent some “supervising forces” to Homs on Friday but any significant deployment would risk exposure to Israeli air strikes, western officials said. Israel attacked two Lebanon-Syria border crossings on Friday, Lebanon said.\n\nIran-backed Iraqi militias are on high alert, with thousands of heavily armed fighters ready to deploy ", "done": false, "remarks": "Tool call success: scrape"}

In recent years, Russia has sought instead to focus on political issues in Syria, pushing for a normalization of ties between Ankara and Damascus. While direct negotiations between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Assad have been impossible to arrange because of Assad’s intransigence (he has insisted on the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Syria as a precondition for normalizing relations), the recent events in Aleppo might change the balance of power, forcing Damascus to soften its demands.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[7]:\nTITLE: Iran and Russia to Support Syrian Regime with Airstrikes and Troop ...\nURL: https://www.armyrecognition.com/focus-analysis-conflicts/army/conflicts-in-the-world/syria-conflict-news/iran-and-russia-to-support-syrian-regime-with-airstrikes-and-troop-deployments\nCONTENT: The rebels, supported by Turkey, are attempting to overthrow the regime of Bashar al-Assad, while the regime receives crucial military support from Russia, Iran, and Iraq, all of which view Syria as a key area for their geopolitical objectives in the region.

By supporting the Syrian regime, Iraq secures its borders, preventing the spread of influence from Sunni rebels or Kurdish groups, which are viewed as threats to Iraq’s internal stability.

Turkish-backed elements now control significant areas in northern Syria, having moved swiftly in the wake of Assad's fall to capture regions like Manbij from Kurdish militias <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nAnkara's objectives include reversing the flow of Syrian refugees back into the northern territories it influences, leveraging peace along its borders to stabilize the region and manage domestic sentiment where refugee hosting is seen as economically burdensome <citation>https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-turkey-aims-capitalise-syrias-rebel-offensive</citation>. Despite denying direct involvement in current offensives, Turkey has maintained support for the Syrian National Army, which plays a vital role in ongoing conflicts against Kurdish forces, aligning with its broader strategy to mitigate Kurdish influence near its frontier <citation>https://globalvoices.org/2024/12/24/the-complex-nature-of-turkeys-relations-with-syria/</citation>.\n\nTurkey's policy shifts are also shaped by its interactions with global influencers, including the United States and Russia. Having previously lost initiative to these powers, Ankara has adjusted its policies, balancing between safeguarding its military presence and engaging in diplomatic negotiations <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/reconsidering-turkeys-influence-syrian-conflict</citation>.

The country’s new rulers have been trying to pave the way for a political transitional process. Regional countries also do not stay idle in this new period. Some regional countries have already started engaging in political talks with HTS and its allies through the Department of Political Affairs of the new government in the country. So far, meetings have been held with ambassadors of Iraq, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt, UAE, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Italy. It was also announced that Qatar would soon open its embassy in Damascus.\n\nIt is safe to say that following the December 8th Revolution, Iran (and its proxies) emerged as the biggest losers along with the deposed Assad regime after the sweeping offensive led by HTS and Türkiye-backed Syrian rebels started on November 27th and ended on December 8th. Russia’s influence in the country has also shrunk. Nonetheless, it is still in a better position than Iran.\n\nIn an environment where developments are unfolding rapidly, it is essential to enumerate and understand the stances of Syrian, regional, and global actors to forecast what may come next.\n\nSyrian Actors:\n\nAfter the revolution, Syria is de facto divided into two main axes: Opposition forces (the new administration in Damascus) and the Syrian Democratic Forces. The new government controls approximately 70 percent of the country, while SDF controls around 30 percent. The SDF was expelled from Western Euphrates (Tel Rıf’at and Manbij) through the Türkiye-backed Syrian National Army’s ‘Operation Freedom Dawn’. In addition, the SDF withdrew from the Western Bank of Deir ez-Zour after the local Arab population revolted against it. In the upcoming period, the Arab-populated Eastern Syria will likely face new revolts, leading to the shrinking of the SDF control zones. New clashes between the SNA forces and SDF seem to be underway. A wing from the SDF’s Deir Ez-Zour Military Council also defected from it and joined the HTS-allied coalition. That said, SDF is trying to reach out to Damascus and cut a deal with HTS. By deciding to raise the flag of revolution, the SDF is trying to reconcile with HTS in the post-Assad regime era.\n\nOn the other side, the HTS-backed Syrian Salvation Government’s Prime Minister Mohammad Bashir has been appointed as the transitional period Prime Minister in the country, with a mandate that will expire on March 1, 2025. The transitional Prime Minister has already met with the HTS-backed Salvation Government’s and the ousted regime’s ministers in a meeting.\n\nAlthough the situation on the ground seems to be on track among the new rulers of Syria, it is beyond doubt that they will vie for power in the upcoming period. Thus, a challenging period is ahead. And the new government has no option but to share power among different actors.\n\nRegional Actors:\n\nTürkiye\n\nTürkiye emerged as the primary winner in the recent developments. The triumph of the new rulers of Syria is likely to incentivize a big chunk of the Syrian refugees in Türkiye to return to their homeland. Moreover, Türkiye also found the chance to clear SDF from the Western Euphrates, and it is now doubling down to do the same in the Eastern Euphrates in an effort to guarantee the safety of its southern borders due to the threats it has been perceiving from the SDF. Türkiye will also likely increase its trade activities with Syria as the dust settles slowly in the upcoming period.\n\nDiplomatically, Türkiye was also the first country to send its officials to Damascus. The Turkish Intelligence Chief Ibrahim Kalın visited Damascus and held meetings with the new faces of the government in Damascus. Additionally, Türkiye has appointed Burhan Köroğlu as the charge d’affaires to Damascus, and opened its embassy after 12 years of hiatus.\n\nIran\n\nIran is undoubtedly the biggest loser in recent events. Iranian influence and investments through the sectarian militias and billions of dollars that Tehran has invested in Syria have evaporated during the lightning offensive. As a result, Tehran abandoned Bashar al-Assad to its fate following the blows that it had to deal with in the aftermath of the repercussions of the 7th of October. The Iranian officials continue to frame the revolution in Syria as an American-Israeli plot. Moreover, they also interchangeably accuse the Syrian regime, Türkiye, and Russia.\n\nAlthough Iran has softened the rhetoric towards the new rulers of Syria, it is implausible that the new government in Syria will have a positive relationship with Iran due to Tehran’s track record of destroying Syria by supporting al-Assad via IRGC and Shiite militias from many countries including Afghanistan and Pakistan. Nonetheless, Iranian officials still claim that they got guarantees from the new administration in Damascus regarding the security of their embassy. Thus, they are willing to reopen it soon.\n\nIraq\n\nIn recent years, amid a series of political and regional shifts, Iraq has adopted a more introspective approach, leaning toward disengagement from external conflicts.\n\nIraqi officials have increasingly focused on preventing the spillover effects of the Syrian conflict from impacting their own country. As part of this strategy, Iraq has closed its borders with Syria to limit potential security threats, particularly following the arrival of around 4,000 Syrian soldiers who fled their military service. Various Iraqi factions remain on edge as they await new political leadership in Syria while maintaining a cautious stance by avoiding direct involvement in regional power struggles.\n\nThis cautious approach reflects the socio-economic internal fatigue and broader regional trends, such as Iran’s setbacks, which affected its proxies in the region in their regional role as well as their domestic power.\n\nLebanon\n\nOn the official front, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has called for Lebanon to distance itself from the Syrian conflict and to secure its borders at a time when the country has yet to recover from its war with Israel, and the ceasefire agreement remains fragile. After ensuring stability in the south, the Lebanese hope that the upcoming presidential election, scheduled for January 9th, will pave the way for recovery and the restoration of institutional order, beginning with the election of a president.\n\nHowever, the fall of the Syrian regime is expected to embolden the Lebanese opposition forces against Hezbollah and its allies, reflecting a regional weakening of the organization. In response, Hezbollah is likely to cling more firmly to its socio-political role in Lebanon, seeing it as its last chance. This dynamic suggests that Lebanon is poised for a period of political tension and power struggles before reaching stability as the political landscape is reshaped to reflect the shifting balance of regional power. On the other hand, focus is expected to increase on the return of Syrian refugees, who number more than two million, as the reasons for their displacement have diminished.\n\nJordan\n\nJordan initially supported the Assad regime during the Syrian rebels’ offensive. Later, it changed the rhetoric and welcomed the change in the country. Also, the Jordanian ambassador in Damascus met with the new rulers of Syria.\n\nMany Arab countries fear the return of the specter of the uprisings or a second rise of the Islamists that could threaten their rule, similar to the initial rise following the Arab Spring revolts.\n\nFor Jordan, in addition to these fears, its primary focus regarding Syria over the past years has been controlling borders and halting smuggling operations, a goal it has pursued through engagement with the Assad regime without achieving the desired outcomes. After the Assad regime’s downfall, Jordan, through its officials, expressed its readiness “to provide any assistance needed by the brotherly Syrian people.” Jordan fears that Syria might “slide into chaos,” a scenario that poses a major concern for maintaining security and stability within Jordan itself. In addition, Jordan has not hidden its concerns, as expressed by its officials, about the Israeli advances in Syria, which naturally represent a threat to Jordan’s security. Therefore, it is expected to see more significant Jordanian engagement with Syria’s new rulers, especially regarding border issues.\n\nEgypt\n\nEgypt’s response to the fall of the Syrian regime was cautious and delayed. When it came, the Egyptian Foreign Minister described the situation as a “change” and affirmed Egypt’s willingness to assist in easing the suffering of the Syrian people, supporting safe refugee returns, and participating in reconstruction efforts.\n\nAs a leading opponent of political Islam, Egypt remains deeply concerned about the transformation in Syria, fearing a second Arab spring wave, especially with Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group, at the forefront of the change in Syria. Also, the Egyptian leaders fear the potential spread of jihadist movements, which could threaten its governance or compromise national security.\n\nDespite economic challenges, Egypt has faced relatively fewer issues with its Syrian refugee population than other nations. However, it sees an opportunity to strengthen its economy and reclaim some of the regional influence it has lost in recent years by supporting refugee returns and participating in reconstruction efforts. Amidst these fears, the Egyptian ambassador met with the new administration officials in Syria.\n\nIsrael\n\nIsrael has maintained a military-centric approach to its view of the region. While the fall of Assad’s regime worked in Israel’s favor by disrupting the Iran-Hezbollah supply corridor and curbing Iranian influenc[TOO LONG, END]\n", "action_taken": "<answer>\n### Domestic\n\nFollowing the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, the domestic landscape in Syria has been marked by significant shifts and challenges.

The new government controls approximately 70% of the country, while SDF controls about 30%.

This massive rebel advance has resulted in incredible regime material losses - with almost all equipment being captured, not destroyed - making its losses extra painful for the regime and its allies (Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah) because now all those captured weapons and munitions can be used against their former owners.\nThis is only the latest case of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) being the biggest supplier of weapons and ammo to the forces it has been fighting. But the amount of equipment and munitions captured from the regime forces during this rout from Aleppo and Idlib governorates has been unprecedented. And it isnt just quantity of weapons - rebel captures include a whole collection of powerful and complex weapons like fighter jets (even if only some of the captured ones are likely operational), long range MRLS, and SAM systems. While using these weapons systems will be difficult for rebels, if they mamage to make operational even just some of them, it would pose a serious problem for the regime military and its allies.\nA detailed list of the destroyed and captured heavy weapons can be seen below.  \nThis list only includes captured vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available. Therefore, the amount of equipment destroyed or captured by Syrian rebel forces is undoubtedly higher than recorded here. Losses of trucks, jeeps, etc. might be added later. Small arms and munitions are not included in this list to preserve the sanity of people documenting regime losses.  \nThis list will be updated as additional footage becomes available.\nNote: this list will at least for now list only equipment losses that happened on or before the regime collapse in Hama on December 5th 2024 - depending on the later events, this list might later be expanded, but if the regime falls, there would be no point in listing literally everything that the regimes military osed to own.\n(Click on the numbers to get a picture of each individual captured or destroyed

He added that insurgents were headed from southern Syria toward the city.\n\nLone suspect charged with murdering two Israeli embassy staff in shooting near Jewish museum in Washington\n\nMore than 350 lawyers and academics say Government not complying with international law obligations over Palestine crisis\n\nAid trucks enter Gaza after delays as pressure mounts on Israel\n\nNetanyahu’s promise of Israel’s ‘total victory’ over Hamas is likely to remain elusive dream\n\nThe rebels, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militant group, earlier said they had reached the edge of the central city of Homs as government forces attempted to buttress collapsing front lines and preserve Bashar al-Assad’s 24-year rule. Syria’s state news agency denied rumours that Assad has left the country, saying he is at work in Damascus.\n\nThe leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a former al Qaeda affiliate, said in a video message on Saturday that the rebels were “in the final moments of liberating” Homs.\n\nSince the rebels’ sweep into Aleppo a week ago, government defences have crumbled across the country at dizzying speed as insurgents rose up in places where the rebellion had long seemed over. Besides capturing Aleppo in the north, Hama in the centre and Deir al-Zor in the east, rebels took contol of Suweida and Deraa.\n\nSyria’s military said it was carrying out air strikes around Hama and Homs and reinforcing on that front. It also said it was repositioning around Deraa and Suweida, without acknowledging their capture by rebels.\n\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday it was inadmissible to allow what he called a terrorist group to take control of Syrian lands. He was speaking in Doha, Qatar after meeting the Turkish and Iranian foreign ministers.\n\nRussia, a long-term ally of Syria, intervened in 2015 to prop up Damascus during Syria’s civil war, which began in 2011. It maintains a military presence in Syria, including a naval base and airbases in the cities of Tartus and Latakia, in the coastal region that is a stronghold of Assad’s Alawite sect.\n\nMr Lavrov said Russia would “help the Syrian army to counter the attacks of terrorists”.\n\nThe UN’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called for urgent talks to ensure an “orderly political transition”.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the annual Doha Forum, he said the talks in Geneva, Switzerland would discuss the implementation of a UN resolution that called for a Syrian-led political process. Resolution 2254, adopted in 2015, called for the establishment of a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with UN-supervised elections.\n\nThe pace of events in Syria has stunned Arab capitals, western officials say, raising their fears of a fresh wave of regional instability.\n\nSyria's civil war, which erupted in 2011 as an uprising against Assad's rule, dragged in big outside powers, created space for jihadist militants to plot attacks around the world and sent millions of refugees into neighbouring states.\n\nAssad had long relied on allies to subdue the rebels, with Russian warplanes bombing from the skies while Iran sent allied forces including Lebanon’s Hizbullah and Iraqi militia to bolster the Syrian military and storm insurgent strongholds.\n\nBut Russia has been focused on the war in Ukraine since 2022 and Hizbullah’s leadership has been decimated this year in its own gruelling war with Israel.\n\nHizbullah sent some “supervising forces” to Homs on Friday but any significant deployment would risk exposure to Israeli air strikes, western officials said. Israel attacked two Lebanon-Syria border crossings on Friday, Lebanon said.\n\nIran-backed Iraqi militias are on high alert, with thousands of heavily armed fighters ready to deploy ", "action_taken": "<answer>```json\n{\n  \"sections\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Closing offensives\",\n      \"content\": [\n        {\n          \"summary\": \"The closing offensives of the 2024 Syrian conflict saw Syrian rebels make significant advances against the government forces, capturing key territories including Aleppo, and pushing towards the city of Hama.

Fighters from various rebel factions, including a group linked to Al Qaeda called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, had advanced by Wednesday to within about six miles of Aleppo and taken over weapons and vehicles previously held by forces loyal to the government of President Bashar al-Assad, according to the monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. “Pro-regime militias have been upping their attacks in the area, trying to deter the rebels because Israel has been weakening the Syrian regime’s allies like Hezbollah and Iran,” said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[3]:\nTITLE: The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an ...\nURL: https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and\nCONTENT: The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an opportunity for Turkey and a challenge for Russia | OSW Centre for Eastern Studies The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an opportunity for Turkey and a challenge for Russia In recent days, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reportedly visited Moscow, while the leaders of Russia and Iran engaged in telephone discussions, as did the foreign ministers of these countries and Turkey.

The official Russian news agency TASS cited the Syrian army command in a report Sunday as saying that their air forces “stepped up strikes on terrorist positions and their supply lines, with dozens killed and wounded.” The White Helmets said at least four people were killed on Sunday in airstrikes on Idlib city, a province that now appears to be entirely in rebel hands.

Left: A rebel fighter gestures while standing on a military aircraft that belonged to forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, inside Hama's military airport, after Syrian rebels battled government forces for control of the key city of Homs on Saturday and advanced towards the capital Damascus as front lines collapsed across the country, in Hama, Syria, Dec. 7, 2024.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[3]:\nTITLE: Syria: Which countries have been involved in the war and why?\nURL: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd75e8gdy9jo\nCONTENT: Those with a vested interest in the conflict and the future of the country include, on one side, Russia and Iran - which backed Assad - and on the other, the US and Turkey, which supported different rebel groups and militias. During Syria's civil war, Turkey has supported rebel factions - most of which now fight under the banner of the Syrian National Army (SNA) - by providing arms, military and political support. Russian President Vladimir Putin used his country's presence in Syria, and support of Assad, to challenge the power and dominance of the West in the region.

The offensive by Islamic militants and allied pro-Turkish groups in Syria’s Idlib and Aleppo provinces is the biggest military escalation in Syria since Russia and Türkiye brokered a ceasefire in 2020. In recent years, Russia has sought instead to focus on political issues in Syria, pushing for a normalization of ties between Ankara and Damascus. While direct negotiations between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Assad have been impossible to arrange because of Assad’s intransigence (he has insisted on the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Syria as a precondition for normalizing relations), the recent events in Aleppo might change the balance of power, forcing Damascus to soften its demands.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[5]:\nTITLE: Syria: What is the situation five months after Assad's fall?\nURL: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/syria-what-is-the-situation-five-months-after-assads-fall/\nCONTENT: In December 2024, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a UN-designated terrorist group that previously governed Idlib in northwest Syria, captured the Syrian capital, Damascus, and declared a transitional government. This Insight looks at the current state of Syria and international reaction to the newly declared government. In April 2025, the leader of HTS and declared interim President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, announced a new government and constitutional declaration. Israel has occupied parts of southern Syria around the Golan Heights for an “unlimited amount of time” and says no forces of the declared Syrian Government should enter the region. The UK Government and the European Union have both welcomed the declaration of a new Syrian Government and its commitment to elections and the rights of minorities.

If Russia succeeds in doing so, it could regain influence in other regions, including Syria and the Middle East. Russian sway in Syria allowed Moscow to block potential natural gas pipeline projects from the Persian Gulf to Europe, which could circumvent Russia. Additionally, from Moscow’s perspective, what happened in Syria was primarily a defeat for its Syrian allies, rather than for Russia. From its perspective, a victory over the Western countries in Ukraine would provide momentum for a shift toward a polycentric world order and imply that Russia’s revitalization in the Middle East remains possible in the long term.

In April 2025, the leader of HTS and declared interim President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, announced a new government and constitutional declaration.

If Russia succeeds in doing so, it could regain influence in other regions, including Syria and the Middle East. Russian sway in Syria allowed Moscow to block potential natural gas pipeline projects from the Persian Gulf to Europe, which could circumvent Russia. Additionally, from Moscow’s perspective, what happened in Syria was primarily a defeat for its Syrian allies, rather than for Russia. From its perspective, a victory over the Western countries in Ukraine would provide momentum for a shift toward a polycentric world order and imply that Russia’s revitalization in the Middle East remains possible in the long term.

While direct negotiations between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Assad have been impossible to arrange because of Assad’s intransigence (he has insisted on the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Syria as a precondition for normalizing relations), the recent events in Aleppo might change the balance of power, forcing Damascus to soften its demands.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[5]:\nTITLE: Syria: What is the situation five months after Assad's fall?\nURL: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/syria-what-is-the-situation-five-months-after-assads-fall/\nCONTENT: In December 2024, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a UN-designated terrorist group that previously governed Idlib in northwest Syria, captured the Syrian capital, Damascus, and declared a transitional government.

If Russia succeeds in doing so, it could regain influence in other regions, including Syria and the Middle East. Russian sway in Syria allowed Moscow to block potential natural gas pipeline projects from the Persian Gulf to Europe, which could circumvent Russia. Additionally, from Moscow’s perspective, what happened in Syria was primarily a defeat for its Syrian allies, rather than for Russia. From its perspective, a victory over the Western countries in Ukraine would provide momentum for a shift toward a polycentric world order and imply that Russia’s revitalization in the Middle East remains possible in the long term.

In 2024, following the fall of the Assad government, Russia's position in Syria appeared increasingly precarious.\n\n#### Military Involvement\nRussia continued to support Syrian government forces through joint military operations. Despite the loss of Aleppo to rebel forces, Russia, alongside Syria, conducted airstrikes against Islamist-led rebels who had seized control of significant areas. The resurgence of conflict marked the largest military escalation since the ceasefire brokered by Russia and Türkiye in 2020 [source](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/12/02/syria-russia-conduct-deadly-strikes-to-push-back-islamist-advance-a87187).\n\n#### Political and Strategic Interests\nThroughout the conflict, Russia aimed to maintain its military presence and geopolitical influence by securing its bases, which remain strategically important for its operations in the Mediterranean and broader Middle East. Despite the shifting alliances and changes in Syrian governance, Russia has sought to bolster its regional influence while engaging in negotiations with other key players, including Iran and Türkiye [source](https://theworld.org/stories/2024/12/09/russias-military-role-in-syria).\n\n#### Challenges and Diplomacy\nThe fall of Assad and the rise of opposition groups presented new challenges for Russia.
