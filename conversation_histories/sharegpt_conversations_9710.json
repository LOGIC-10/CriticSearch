In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: 2024 Belgian elections Francophone parties\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: Looking ahead: The road to reinvention for Belgium's struggling ...\\nURL: https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties\\nCONTENT: Belgium’s 2024 elections exposed significant challenges for several political parties, from the Flemish liberals to the francophone socialists. To reconnect with its base and attract new supporters, the party will need to find a balance between traditional liberal principles and new solutions to issues like affordable housing, energy policy and social mobility. Critics, both within and outside the party, argue that Groen has become too much like traditional political organisations by focusing on power dynamics and internal disputes rather than bold, transformative solutions. To address these challenges, PS leader Paul Magnette has announced a “refoundation” of the party, a deep introspection aimed at rebuilding the party’s core identity and relevance in a political landscape that increasingly seems resistant to left-wing ideals of solidarity and collective responsibility.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: Élections 2024: comparez les programmes des six partis\\nURL: https://www.lecho.be/guide-elections-2024.html\\nCONTENT: Guide Élections 2024 Élections 2024: comparez les programmes des partis politiques belges L'Echo a comparé pour vous les programmes des six partis francophones pour les prochaines élections.

In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution.

These constituencies primarily encompass the Wallonia region and the French-speaking voters in Brussels, who collectively elect representatives in the federal government.\n\nIn Wallonia, the key political players include the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR), and the centrist Les Engagés. Recent polls indicate a competitive race, with the MR emerging as a strong contender alongside PS and other left-wing parties like the Workers' Party of Belgium (PTB) gaining traction among the electorate <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The dynamics in these areas illustrate a broader trend towards consolidation for liberal parties, which have traditionally held significant influence within the Francophone community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1061134/mr-extends-its-lead-among-french-speaking-parties-in-final-election-dash</citation>.\n\nIn the Brussels-Capital Region, which serves as the administrative center of Belgium, the voting is divided into multiple electoral constituencies. French-speaking voters have the option to choose representatives from the French-speaking lists, which have tailored their campaigns to resonate with the diverse population of the city. The outcome of these elections will not only influence the structure of local government but also affect the overall composition of the federal parliament, as Brussels is a critical battleground for both Francophone and Dutch-speaking parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\nThe rise of parties advocating for regional reform, coupled with reduced voter turnout expectations, highlights an evolving political landscape for French-speaking constituencies. As the Francophone community navigates issues ranging from social equity to economic policy, the 2024 elections are seen as a pivotal moment for re-evaluating their political strategies and alliances <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the French-speaking constituencies in Belgium are central to the discourse surrounding the 2024 federal elections. The interplay between traditional parties and emerging political movements will significantly impact the direction of federal policies and governance in the nation.\n</answer>"

These constituencies primarily encompass the Wallonia region and the French-speaking voters in Brussels, who collectively elect representatives in the federal government.\n\nIn Wallonia, the key political players include the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR), and the centrist Les Engagés. Recent polls indicate a competitive race, with the MR emerging as a strong contender alongside PS and other left-wing parties like the Workers' Party of Belgium (PTB) gaining traction among the electorate <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The dynamics in these areas illustrate a broader trend towards consolidation for liberal parties, which have traditionally held significant influence within the Francophone community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1061134/mr-extends-its-lead-among-french-speaking-parties-in-final-election-dash</citation>.\n\nIn the Brussels-Capital Region, which serves as the administrative center of Belgium, the voting is divided into multiple electoral constituencies. French-speaking voters have the option to choose representatives from the French-speaking lists, which have tailored their campaigns to resonate with the diverse population of the city. The outcome of these elections will not only influence the structure of local government but also affect the overall composition of the federal parliament, as Brussels is a critical battleground for both Francophone and Dutch-speaking parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\nThe rise of parties advocating for regional reform, coupled with reduced voter turnout expectations, highlights an evolving political landscape for French-speaking constituencies. As the Francophone community navigates issues ranging from social equity to economic policy, the 2024 elections are seen as a pivotal moment for re-evaluating their political strategies and alliances <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the French-speaking constituencies in Belgium are central to the discourse surrounding the 2024 federal elections. The interplay between traditional parties and emerging political movements will significantly impact the direction of federal policies and governance in the nation.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Opinion polls\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

        "value": "<answer>\n## Opinion Polls\n\nAs Belgium approaches its federal elections on June 9, 2024, a range of opinion polls have been conducted to gauge public sentiment and voting intentions across the country. These polls reflect the changing political landscape and the dynamics among various parties since the last federal election in May 2019.\n\nThe most recent poll conducted by Ipsos shows notable support for the major parties, with the Liberal Reformist Party (MR) leading at 27.4%, followed closely by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%. Other parties, including the Green parties (Ecolo) at 8.1% and the left-wing Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA/PTB) at 12.9%, are also represented in the polls <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/institute/ipsos</citation>.\n\nIn addition to the Ipsos poll, a comprehensive survey conducted from May 28 to May 31, 2024, indicates that the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical right-wing party Vlaams Belang (VB) remain significant contenders in the Flemish region, although exact percentages were not disclosed <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The context is critical, as the country has experienced increasing political polarization and shifting alliances in the run-up to this election. \n\nAs political uncertainty looms, the latest predictions suggest that the current governing coalition, comprised of diverse political factions, could see a reduction in seats, complicating the formation of future governing coalitions <citation>https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/country-risk/rising-political-polarisation-ahead-belgian-federal-elections-17-04-2024</citation>.\n\nThese opinion polls not only provide insight into voter preferences but also highlight the potential consequences of political alliances and the overall stability of the Belgian government heading into 2024. The ensuing months will be critical as parties ramp up their campaigns and attempt to sway undecided voters in a landscape marked by fragmentation and multiple parties vying for influence.\n</answer>"

These constituencies primarily encompass the Wallonia region and the French-speaking voters in Brussels, who collectively elect representatives in the federal government.\n\nIn Wallonia, the key political players include the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR), and the centrist Les Engagés. Recent polls indicate a competitive race, with the MR emerging as a strong contender alongside PS and other left-wing parties like the Workers' Party of Belgium (PTB) gaining traction among the electorate <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The dynamics in these areas illustrate a broader trend towards consolidation for liberal parties, which have traditionally held significant influence within the Francophone community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1061134/mr-extends-its-lead-among-french-speaking-parties-in-final-election-dash</citation>.\n\nIn the Brussels-Capital Region, which serves as the administrative center of Belgium, the voting is divided into multiple electoral constituencies. French-speaking voters have the option to choose representatives from the French-speaking lists, which have tailored their campaigns to resonate with the diverse population of the city. The outcome of these elections will not only influence the structure of local government but also affect the overall composition of the federal parliament, as Brussels is a critical battleground for both Francophone and Dutch-speaking parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\nThe rise of parties advocating for regional reform, coupled with reduced voter turnout expectations, highlights an evolving political landscape for French-speaking constituencies. As the Francophone community navigates issues ranging from social equity to economic policy, the 2024 elections are seen as a pivotal moment for re-evaluating their political strategies and alliances <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the French-speaking constituencies in Belgium are central to the discourse surrounding the 2024 federal elections. The interplay between traditional parties and emerging political movements will significantly impact the direction of federal policies and governance in the nation.\n## Opinion Polls\n\nAs Belgium approaches its federal elections on June 9, 2024, a range of opinion polls have been conducted to gauge public sentiment and voting intentions across the country. These polls reflect the changing political landscape and the dynamics among various parties since the last federal election in May 2019.\n\nThe most recent poll conducted by Ipsos shows notable support for the major parties, with the Liberal Reformist Party (MR) leading at 27.4%, followed closely by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%. Other parties, including the Green parties (Ecolo) at 8.1% and the left-wing Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA/PTB) at 12.9%, are also represented in the polls <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/institute/ipsos</citation>.\n\nIn addition to the Ipsos poll, a comprehensive survey conducted from May 28 to May 31, 2024, indicates that the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical right-wing party Vlaams Belang (VB) remain significant contenders in the Flemish region, although exact percentages were not disclosed <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The context is critical, as the country has experienced increasing political polarization and shifting alliances in the run-up to this election. \n\nAs political uncertainty looms, the latest predictions suggest that the current governing coalition, comprised of diverse political factions, could see a reduction in seats, complicating the formation of future governing coalitions <citation>https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/country-risk/rising-political-polarisation-ahead-belgian-federal-elections-17-04-2024</citation>.\n\nThese opinion polls not only provide insight into voter preferences but also highlight the potential consequences of political alliances and the overall stability of the Belgian government heading into 2024. The ensuing months will be critical as parties ramp up their campaigns and attempt to sway undecided voters in a landscape marked by fragmentation and multiple parties vying for influence.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Background\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: The Belgian elections' biggest winners... and losers\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers\\nCONTENT: It ended with around 12%.

Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament. Another coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too.\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: 2024 elections candidates and parties\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: 2024 Presidential Candidates - CNN\\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/presidential-candidates-dg/\\nCONTENT: 2024 Presidential Candidates By CNN Staff Updated October 21, 2024 Former President Donald Trump is the Republican presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee.

To reconnect with its base and attract new supporters, the party will need to find a balance between traditional liberal principles and new solutions to issues like affordable housing, energy policy and social mobility. Critics, both within and outside the party, argue that Groen has become too much like traditional political organisations by focusing on power dynamics and internal disputes rather than bold, transformative solutions. To address these challenges, PS leader Paul Magnette has announced a “refoundation” of the party, a deep introspection aimed at rebuilding the party’s core identity and relevance in a political landscape that increasingly seems resistant to left-wing ideals of solidarity and collective responsibility.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: SGI 2024 | Belgium | Key Findings\\nURL: https://www.sgi-network.org/2024/Belgium/Key_Findings\\nCONTENT: The consociational political system typically involves a grand coalition and mutual veto rights.

This election holds significant importance as it represents a crucial moment in Belgium's intricate political landscape, shaped by a complex system of governance that includes both federal and regional authorities <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/belgium-2024-election.html</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Belgium has been characterized by a fragmented political system marked by linguistic and regional divisions between the Dutch-speaking Flanders region and the French-speaking Wallonia. The elections are expected to be a pivotal point for various political parties, particularly with the anticipated rise of right-wing and far-right factions, such as the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and Vlaams Belang (VB), which have been polling strongly <citation>https://politico.eu/article/belgium-far-right-election-extremist-landslide-elections-in-europe-results-2024/</citation>. These parties' prominence reflects broader trends across Europe, where populist sentiments have gained significant traction in recent years.\n\nThe Federal Parliament of Belgium consists of a bicameral system, including the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. Political dynamics are led by coalition-based governance, where no single party has achieved a clear majority since World War I. As Belgium moves towards the 2024 elections, numerous coalitions are being envisioned, including the potential resurgence of a center-right coalition comprising the N-VA, the liberals (Open VLD and MR), and elements of the Christian Democrats <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>.\n\nThe expectation of low voter turnout, the lowest since 1893, adds another layer of complexity to the elections, suggesting potential voter disengagement amid a tumultuous political climate shaped by economic challenges, social issues, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nAs the campaigning intensifies, political leaders and parties will be keenly navigating the landscape to secure necessary coalitions to govern, reflecting the shifting allegiances and priorities of the Belgian electorate. The outcome of these elections could greatly influence Belgium’s domestic and European policy directions in the coming years.\n</answer>"

These constituencies primarily encompass the Wallonia region and the French-speaking voters in Brussels, who collectively elect representatives in the federal government.\n\nIn Wallonia, the key political players include the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR), and the centrist Les Engagés. Recent polls indicate a competitive race, with the MR emerging as a strong contender alongside PS and other left-wing parties like the Workers' Party of Belgium (PTB) gaining traction among the electorate <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The dynamics in these areas illustrate a broader trend towards consolidation for liberal parties, which have traditionally held significant influence within the Francophone community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1061134/mr-extends-its-lead-among-french-speaking-parties-in-final-election-dash</citation>.\n\nIn the Brussels-Capital Region, which serves as the administrative center of Belgium, the voting is divided into multiple electoral constituencies. French-speaking voters have the option to choose representatives from the French-speaking lists, which have tailored their campaigns to resonate with the diverse population of the city. The outcome of these elections will not only influence the structure of local government but also affect the overall composition of the federal parliament, as Brussels is a critical battleground for both Francophone and Dutch-speaking parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\nThe rise of parties advocating for regional reform, coupled with reduced voter turnout expectations, highlights an evolving political landscape for French-speaking constituencies. As the Francophone community navigates issues ranging from social equity to economic policy, the 2024 elections are seen as a pivotal moment for re-evaluating their political strategies and alliances <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the French-speaking constituencies in Belgium are central to the discourse surrounding the 2024 federal elections. The interplay between traditional parties and emerging political movements will significantly impact the direction of federal policies and governance in the nation.\n## Opinion Polls\n\nAs Belgium approaches its federal elections on June 9, 2024, a range of opinion polls have been conducted to gauge public sentiment and voting intentions across the country. These polls reflect the changing political landscape and the dynamics among various parties since the last federal election in May 2019.\n\nThe most recent poll conducted by Ipsos shows notable support for the major parties, with the Liberal Reformist Party (MR) leading at 27.4%, followed closely by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%. Other parties, including the Green parties (Ecolo) at 8.1% and the left-wing Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA/PTB) at 12.9%, are also represented in the polls <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/institute/ipsos</citation>.\n\nIn addition to the Ipsos poll, a comprehensive survey conducted from May 28 to May 31, 2024, indicates that the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical right-wing party Vlaams Belang (VB) remain significant contenders in the Flemish region, although exact percentages were not disclosed <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The context is critical, as the country has experienced increasing political polarization and shifting alliances in the run-up to this election. \n\nAs political uncertainty looms, the latest predictions suggest that the current governing coalition, comprised of diverse political factions, could see a reduction in seats, complicating the formation of future governing coalitions <citation>https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/country-risk/rising-political-polarisation-ahead-belgian-federal-elections-17-04-2024</citation>.\n\nThese opinion polls not only provide insight into voter preferences but also highlight the potential consequences of political alliances and the overall stability of the Belgian government heading into 2024. The ensuing months will be critical as parties ramp up their campaigns and attempt to sway undecided voters in a landscape marked by fragmentation and multiple parties vying for influence.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to take place on June 9, 2024, coinciding with regional and European Parliament elections. This election holds significant importance as it represents a crucial moment in Belgium's intricate political landscape, shaped by a complex system of governance that includes both federal and regional authorities <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/belgium-2024-election.html</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Belgium has been characterized by a fragmented political system marked by linguistic and regional divisions between the Dutch-speaking Flanders region and the French-speaking Wallonia. The elections are expected to be a pivotal point for various political parties, particularly with the anticipated rise of right-wing and far-right factions, such as the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and Vlaams Belang (VB), which have been polling strongly <citation>https://politico.eu/article/belgium-far-right-election-extremist-landslide-elections-in-europe-results-2024/</citation>. These parties' prominence reflects broader trends across Europe, where populist sentiments have gained significant traction in recent years.\n\nThe Federal Parliament of Belgium consists of a bicameral system, including the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. Political dynamics are led by coalition-based governance, where no single party has achieved a clear majority since World War I. As Belgium moves towards the 2024 elections, numerous coalitions are being envisioned, including the potential resurgence of a center-right coalition comprising the N-VA, the liberals (Open VLD and MR), and elements of the Christian Democrats <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>.\n\nThe expectation of low voter turnout, the lowest since 1893, adds another layer of complexity to the elections, suggesting potential voter disengagement amid a tumultuous political climate shaped by economic challenges, social issues, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nAs the campaigning intensifies, political leaders and parties will be keenly navigating the landscape to secure necessary coalitions to govern, reflecting the shifting allegiances and priorities of the Belgian electorate. The outcome of these elections could greatly influence Belgium’s domestic and European policy directions in the coming years.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Preface\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

When asked about the reasons behind the Workers' Party's breakthrough in the kingdom's French-speaking community since the previous general elections on 26 May 2019, Emilie van Haute, professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels, explains: \\\"The nature of the public debate is quite different: in Flanders, it is much more focused on migration issues, which is very favourable to Vlaams Belang, the party that has made these issues its main campaign theme.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Belgium's 2024 Elections: A Shift to the Right, Though Less Extreme ...\\nURL: https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/\\nCONTENT: In the northern Dutch-speaking region of Flanders, the conservative-nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) secured its place as largest party with 23.9 percent of the Flemish vote, closely followed by the populist radical right Vlaams Belang (VB) with 22.7 percent. In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Belgium's make-or-break election, explained - POLITICO\\nURL: https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/\\nCONTENT: The far-right Vlaams Belang is polling to win up to 27 percent of Flemish votes, making it the largest party in the country — in line with Europe’s expected far-right surge.

In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix.

Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament. Another coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections guide: What Belgium's parties stand for\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/1010080/belgian-elections-guide-2024\\nCONTENT: Belgian elections guide: What Belgium's parties stand for.

As the first federal election post-COVID-19 pandemic, these elections not only concerned the immediate political climate but also reflected underlying trends in voter sentiment and party dynamics, marking a pivotal transition in the nation's governance.\n\nBelgium's electoral structure is complex, comprising three separate parliaments—at federal, regional, and European levels—and these elections included contests for all 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives, alongside regional and EU elections. This layered governance system plays a crucial role in shaping the country's political discourse.\n\nPre-election polls indicated a concerning trend towards the right, with the far-right Vlaams Belang party emerging as a leading contender, projected to capture a significant portion of the electorate. This shift towards populism and radical ideologies raised alarms about the potential implications for coalition politics and governance in Belgium, a country known for its intricate power-sharing arrangements amidst linguistic divides between the Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia.\n\nDespite fears of a far-right transformation, preliminary results post-election suggest a nuanced outcome: while the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) retained a significant share of votes, Vlaams Belang's expected surge did not materialize into an outright dominance. Instead, the results pointed to a continuing fragmentation of the political landscape and an anticipated struggle to form stable coalitions, echoing the ongoing challenges of Belgian governance in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nThis report will delve into the results, candidate profiles, and potential coalition formations emanating from this election, seeking to provide a clear overview of the current state of Belgian politics post-2024 federal elections and its broader implications for the nation. For further insights, one can refer to articles such as \"Belgium's 2024 Elections: A Shift to the Right, Though Less Extreme Than Expected\" <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation>, and analysis from \"The 2024 Belgian federal elections: a race to the right\" <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nEssentially, the 2024 elections not only serve as a barometer of current political sentiments but also set the stage for the future trajectory of governance and political debates in Belgium, amidst challenges of unity and representation.\n</answer>"

You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.\n\n## Tool Use Formatting\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Execute safe mathematical expressions.\\n\\nSupports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **) and common mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc.).\\nFor security reasons, only mathematical expressions are allowed, no arbitrary code execution.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Mathematical expression to calculate, e.g., \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\", \\\"sin(30 * pi / 180)\\\", \\\"sqrt(16)\\\"\"}}, \"required\": [\"expression\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7.

These constituencies primarily encompass the Wallonia region and the French-speaking voters in Brussels, who collectively elect representatives in the federal government.\n\nIn Wallonia, the key political players include the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR), and the centrist Les Engagés. Recent polls indicate a competitive race, with the MR emerging as a strong contender alongside PS and other left-wing parties like the Workers' Party of Belgium (PTB) gaining traction among the electorate <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The dynamics in these areas illustrate a broader trend towards consolidation for liberal parties, which have traditionally held significant influence within the Francophone community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1061134/mr-extends-its-lead-among-french-speaking-parties-in-final-election-dash</citation>.\n\nIn the Brussels-Capital Region, which serves as the administrative center of Belgium, the voting is divided into multiple electoral constituencies. French-speaking voters have the option to choose representatives from the French-speaking lists, which have tailored their campaigns to resonate with the diverse population of the city. The outcome of these elections will not only influence the structure of local government but also affect the overall composition of the federal parliament, as Brussels is a critical battleground for both Francophone and Dutch-speaking parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\nThe rise of parties advocating for regional reform, coupled with reduced voter turnout expectations, highlights an evolving political landscape for French-speaking constituencies. As the Francophone community navigates issues ranging from social equity to economic policy, the 2024 elections are seen as a pivotal moment for re-evaluating their political strategies and alliances <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the French-speaking constituencies in Belgium are central to the discourse surrounding the 2024 federal elections. The interplay between traditional parties and emerging political movements will significantly impact the direction of federal policies and governance in the nation.\n## Opinion Polls\n\nAs Belgium approaches its federal elections on June 9, 2024, a range of opinion polls have been conducted to gauge public sentiment and voting intentions across the country. These polls reflect the changing political landscape and the dynamics among various parties since the last federal election in May 2019.\n\nThe most recent poll conducted by Ipsos shows notable support for the major parties, with the Liberal Reformist Party (MR) leading at 27.4%, followed closely by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%. Other parties, including the Green parties (Ecolo) at 8.1% and the left-wing Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA/PTB) at 12.9%, are also represented in the polls <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/institute/ipsos</citation>.\n\nIn addition to the Ipsos poll, a comprehensive survey conducted from May 28 to May 31, 2024, indicates that the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical right-wing party Vlaams Belang (VB) remain significant contenders in the Flemish region, although exact percentages were not disclosed <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The context is critical, as the country has experienced increasing political polarization and shifting alliances in the run-up to this election. \n\nAs political uncertainty looms, the latest predictions suggest that the current governing coalition, comprised of diverse political factions, could see a reduction in seats, complicating the formation of future governing coalitions <citation>https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/country-risk/rising-political-polarisation-ahead-belgian-federal-elections-17-04-2024</citation>.\n\nThese opinion polls not only provide insight into voter preferences but also highlight the potential consequences of political alliances and the overall stability of the Belgian government heading into 2024. The ensuing months will be critical as parties ramp up their campaigns and attempt to sway undecided voters in a landscape marked by fragmentation and multiple parties vying for influence.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to take place on June 9, 2024, coinciding with regional and European Parliament elections. This election holds significant importance as it represents a crucial moment in Belgium's intricate political landscape, shaped by a complex system of governance that includes both federal and regional authorities <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/belgium-2024-election.html</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Belgium has been characterized by a fragmented political system marked by linguistic and regional divisions between the Dutch-speaking Flanders region and the French-speaking Wallonia. The elections are expected to be a pivotal point for various political parties, particularly with the anticipated rise of right-wing and far-right factions, such as the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and Vlaams Belang (VB), which have been polling strongly <citation>https://politico.eu/article/belgium-far-right-election-extremist-landslide-elections-in-europe-results-2024/</citation>. These parties' prominence reflects broader trends across Europe, where populist sentiments have gained significant traction in recent years.\n\nThe Federal Parliament of Belgium consists of a bicameral system, including the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. Political dynamics are led by coalition-based governance, where no single party has achieved a clear majority since World War I. As Belgium moves towards the 2024 elections, numerous coalitions are being envisioned, including the potential resurgence of a center-right coalition comprising the N-VA, the liberals (Open VLD and MR), and elements of the Christian Democrats <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>.\n\nThe expectation of low voter turnout, the lowest since 1893, adds another layer of complexity to the elections, suggesting potential voter disengagement amid a tumultuous political climate shaped by economic challenges, social issues, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nAs the campaigning intensifies, political leaders and parties will be keenly navigating the landscape to secure necessary coalitions to govern, reflecting the shifting allegiances and priorities of the Belgian electorate. The outcome of these elections could greatly influence Belgium’s domestic and European policy directions in the coming years.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, represented a significant moment in Belgium's political landscape. As the first federal election post-COVID-19 pandemic, these elections not only concerned the immediate political climate but also reflected underlying trends in voter sentiment and party dynamics, marking a pivotal transition in the nation's governance.\n\nBelgium's electoral structure is complex, comprising three separate parliaments—at federal, regional, and European levels—and these elections included contests for all 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives, alongside regional and EU elections. This layered governance system plays a crucial role in shaping the country's political discourse.\n\nPre-election polls indicated a concerning trend towards the right, with the far-right Vlaams Belang party emerging as a leading contender, projected to capture a significant portion of the electorate. This shift towards populism and radical ideologies raised alarms about the potential implications for coalition politics and governance in Belgium, a country known for its intricate power-sharing arrangements amidst linguistic divides between the Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia.\n\nDespite fears of a far-right transformation, preliminary results post-election suggest a nuanced outcome: while the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) retained a significant share of votes, Vlaams Belang's expected surge did not materialize into an outright dominance. Instead, the results pointed to a continuing fragmentation of the political landscape and an anticipated struggle to form stable coalitions, echoing the ongoing challenges of Belgian governance in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nThis report will delve into the results, candidate profiles, and potential coalition formations emanating from this election, seeking to provide a clear overview of the current state of Belgian politics post-2024 federal elections and its broader implications for the nation. For further insights, one can refer to articles such as \"Belgium's 2024 Elections: A Shift to the Right, Though Less Extreme Than Expected\" <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation>, and analysis from \"The 2024 Belgian federal elections: a race to the right\" <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nEssentially, the 2024 elections not only serve as a barometer of current political sentiments but also set the stage for the future trajectory of governance and political debates in Belgium, amidst challenges of unity and representation.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Retiring incumbents\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

When asked about the reasons behind the Workers' Party's breakthrough in the kingdom's French-speaking community since the previous general elections on 26 May 2019, Emilie van Haute, professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels, explains: \\\"The nature of the public debate is quite different: in Flanders, it is much more focused on migration issues, which is very favourable to Vlaams Belang, the party that has made these issues its main campaign theme.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections pave way to reform country - POLITICO\\nURL: https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/\\nCONTENT: The Flemish right-wing New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and Francophone liberal Reformist Movement (MR) were the two victors of Sunday’s triple election, in which voters elected new national, regional and European members of parliament. “These are election results that show a willingness for change and reform,” MR’s party President Georges-Louis Bouchez told party militants Sunday evening. De Croo handed over his resignation as prime minister to the country’s King Philippe, a procedural step after which the king meets with leaders of Belgium’s biggest parties: N-VA’s De Wever first, Vlaams Belang’s Tom Van Grieken second and MR’s Bouchez third.

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: King Philippe's role in the formation of Belgium's next government\\nURL: https://www.thebulletin.be/king-philippes-role-formation-belgiums-next-government\\nCONTENT: King Philippe’s role in the formation of Belgium’s next government | The Bulletin King Philippe’s role in the formation of Belgium’s next government Following his party’s defeat in the national elections, prime minister Alexander De Croo (Open VLD) formally tendered his resignation on Monday morning after a visit to King Philippe.

To reconnect with its base and attract new supporters, the party will need to find a balance between traditional liberal principles and new solutions to issues like affordable housing, energy policy and social mobility. Critics, both within and outside the party, argue that Groen has become too much like traditional political organisations by focusing on power dynamics and internal disputes rather than bold, transformative solutions. To address these challenges, PS leader Paul Magnette has announced a “refoundation” of the party, a deep introspection aimed at rebuilding the party’s core identity and relevance in a political landscape that increasingly seems resistant to left-wing ideals of solidarity and collective responsibility.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: SGI 2024 | Belgium | Key Findings\\nURL: https://www.sgi-network.org/2024/Belgium/Key_Findings\\nCONTENT: The consociational political system typically involves a grand coalition and mutual veto rights.

Rousseau has argued that, as the only left-leaning party, Vooruit cannot agree to a coalition that prioritises conservative fiscal reforms and tax cuts, fearing these measures would compromise social security and pensions.

In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix.

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections guide: What Belgium's parties stand for\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/1010080/belgian-elections-guide-2024\\nCONTENT: Sister party in French-speaking Belgium: MR Sister party in French-speaking Belgium: Les Engagés European Parliament group: European People’s Party (EPP) History: Founded in 1968 as the Christian People's Party (Christelijke Volkspartij, CVP), the party changed its name to Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V) in 2001.

In Flanders, the centre-right N-VA, led by Antwerp mayor Bart De Wever, equally surprised pollsters by managing to remain the biggest Flemish party ahead of the right-wing populist Vlaams Belang, kept out of government with a cordon sanitaire imposed by all other political parties. In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. As a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[9]:\\nTITLE: King Philippe's role in the formation of Belgium's next government\\nURL: https://www.thebulletin.be/king-philippes-role-formation-belgiums-next-government\\nCONTENT: King Philippe’s role in the formation of Belgium’s next government | The Bulletin King Philippe’s role in the formation of Belgium’s next government Following his party’s defeat in the national elections, prime minister Alexander De Croo (Open VLD) formally tendered his resignation on Monday morning after a visit to King Philippe.

Abstainers therefore represent virtually the second party in the country, not that far behind the N-VA and its 1.165 million voters. In the European Parliament elections, which also took place on Sunday, Flemish right-wing parties Vlaams Belang and N-VA each held on to their three seats in parliament.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Belgium in Brief: Election upsets and what happens next\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1086236/belgium-in-brief-election-upsets-and-what-happens-next\\nCONTENT: 3.

During his time as an MEP, Verhofstadt became notorious in the UK as the European Parliament's Brexit Coordinator from 2016 to 2020, when, among other things, he openly accused former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson of spreading \\\"disinformation\\\" about Britain's withdrawal from the EU. In addition to being the bête noire of Brexiteers, Verhofstadt also cuts a highly divisive figure in Belgium for his government's perceived fiscal profligacy as well as for his aggressive pro-Europeanism.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: Les Belges doivent travailler jusqu'à 67 ans, mais cet ... - RTL info\\nURL: https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/les-belges-doivent-travailler-jusqua-67-ans-mais-cet-ancien-ministre-touchera/2025-05-19/article/750304\\nCONTENT: Hervé Jamar, ancien ministre et parlementaire, se retire de ses fonctions.

To reconnect with its base and attract new supporters, the party will need to find a balance between traditional liberal principles and new solutions to issues like affordable housing, energy policy and social mobility. Critics, both within and outside the party, argue that Groen has become too much like traditional political organisations by focusing on power dynamics and internal disputes rather than bold, transformative solutions. To address these challenges, PS leader Paul Magnette has announced a “refoundation” of the party, a deep introspection aimed at rebuilding the party’s core identity and relevance in a political landscape that increasingly seems resistant to left-wing ideals of solidarity and collective responsibility.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Belgium gets new government after 236 days of negotiations\\nURL: https://brusselssignal.eu/2025/02/belgium-gets-new-government-after-236-days-of-negotiations/\\nCONTENT: Belgium gets new government after 236 days of negotiations - Brussels Signal King Philippe of Belgium (R) and New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party Chairman Bart De Wever shake hands after their meeting at the Royal Palace in Brussels, Belgium, 31 January 2025.

In Flanders, the centre-right N-VA, led by Antwerp mayor Bart De Wever, equally surprised pollsters by managing to remain the biggest Flemish party ahead of the right-wing populist Vlaams Belang, kept out of government with a cordon sanitaire imposed by all other political parties. In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. As a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: 'Very bad time' to not have a Belgian Government: Why?\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1303116/very-bad-time-to-not-have-a-belgian-government-why\\nCONTENT: Belgians are often quite indifferent about having frequent long periods without a government – yet these fast-changing times make it a particularly bad time for the country not to have a fully functional leadership. While most Belgian headlines agonise about the repercussions of not having a crucial budget plan by next year, some are stressing the implications for the country in the increasingly hostile global context – particularly following Donald Trump's reelection as US President. \\\"What has changed now is mainly our perception, but the reality has been the same for a long time: an international environment that is becoming more and more challenging, for which this country has not really prepared itself and from which it has even looked away,\\\" Mattelaer told The Brussels Times.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: 100 days after Belgium's elections: Where are we now?\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now\\nCONTENT: Now 100 days since Belgium held federal, regional and European elections on 9 June, three of the country's six governments have been formed. In light of these results, the most obvious partners to enter formation talks were N-VA, CD&V, Vooruit, MR and Les Engagés, which ideologically are not too disparate and crucially, can together muster a governing majority. On the French-speaking side, a majority was found quite quickly: winners MR immediately decided to work with Les Engagés, while socialist PS joined at the start of August. Due to the PS's electoral loss, and the wins by MR and Les Engagés, the new Walloon Government and the new French Community Government were both already formed on 11 July (which, ironically, is the Flemish holiday).\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: current politicians Belgium retiring elections 2024\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: Former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt to retire from politics in 2024\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/494091/former-belgian-pm-guy-verhofstadt-to-retire-from-politics-in-2024\\nCONTENT: Former Belgian Prime Minister and current MEP Guy Verhofstadt has announced that he will almost certainly retire from politics by the end of his parliamentary mandate in 2024.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: Why Belgium may be about to break up - POLITICO\\nURL: https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-break-up-flanders-wallonia-tom-van-grieken-vlaams-belang-far-right/\\nCONTENT: Elections are due to be held in June 2024.

Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament.

Abstainers therefore represent virtually the second party in the country, not that far behind the N-VA and its 1.165 million voters.

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: Predicting the Belgian Elections of June 2024: A Political ... - Medium\\nURL: https://medium.com/@adrigol/predicting-the-belgian-elections-of-june-2024-a-political-landscape-in-flux-baa15a88440d\\nCONTENT: Predicting the Belgian Elections of June 2024: A Political Landscape in Flux | by Adriaan | Medium Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Predicting the Belgian Elections of June 2024: A Political Landscape in Flux Election Outcome Predictions Our predictions for the June 2024 elections are based on current political trends, public opinion polls, and socio-economic factors influencing Belgian voters.

During his time as an MEP, Verhofstadt became notorious in the UK as the European Parliament's Brexit Coordinator from 2016 to 2020, when, among other things, he openly accused former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson of spreading \\\"disinformation\\\" about Britain's withdrawal from the EU. In addition to being the bête noire of Brexiteers, Verhofstadt also cuts a highly divisive figure in Belgium for his government's perceived fiscal profligacy as well as for his aggressive pro-Europeanism.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: Looking ahead: The road to reinvention for Belgium's struggling ...\\nURL: https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties\\nCONTENT: Belgium’s 2024 elections exposed significant challenges for several political parties, from the Flemish liberals to the francophone socialists. To reconnect with its base and attract new supporters, the party will need to find a balance between traditional liberal principles and new solutions to issues like affordable housing, energy policy and social mobility. Critics, both within and outside the party, argue that Groen has become too much like traditional political organisations by focusing on power dynamics and internal disputes rather than bold, transformative solutions. To address these challenges, PS leader Paul Magnette has announced a “refoundation” of the party, a deep introspection aimed at rebuilding the party’s core identity and relevance in a political landscape that increasingly seems resistant to left-wing ideals of solidarity and collective responsibility.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Belgium gets new government after 236 days of negotiations\\nURL: https://brusselssignal.eu/2025/02/belgium-gets-new-government-after-236-days-of-negotiations/\\nCONTENT: Belgium gets new government after 236 days of negotiations - Brussels Signal King Philippe of Belgium (R) and New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party Chairman Bart De Wever shake hands after their meeting at the Royal Palace in Brussels, Belgium, 31 January 2025.

In Flanders, the centre-right N-VA, led by Antwerp mayor Bart De Wever, equally surprised pollsters by managing to remain the biggest Flemish party ahead of the right-wing populist Vlaams Belang, kept out of government with a cordon sanitaire imposed by all other political parties. In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. As a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: 'Very bad time' to not have a Belgian Government: Why?\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1303116/very-bad-time-to-not-have-a-belgian-government-why\\nCONTENT: Belgians are often quite indifferent about having frequent long periods without a government – yet these fast-changing times make it a particularly bad time for the country not to have a fully functional leadership. While most Belgian headlines agonise about the repercussions of not having a crucial budget plan by next year, some are stressing the implications for the country in the increasingly hostile global context – particularly following Donald Trump's reelection as US President. \\\"What has changed now is mainly our perception, but the reality has been the same for a long time: an international environment that is becoming more and more challenging, for which this country has not really prepared itself and from which it has even looked away,\\\" Mattelaer told The Brussels Times.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: 100 days after Belgium's elections: Where are we now?\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now\\nCONTENT: Now 100 days since Belgium held federal, regional and European elections on 9 June, three of the country's six governments have been formed.

On the French-speaking side, a majority was found quite quickly: winners MR immediately decided to work with Les Engagés, while socialist PS joined at the start of August. Due to the PS's electoral loss, and the wins by MR and Les Engagés, the new Walloon Government and the new French Community Government were both already formed on 11 July (which, ironically, is the Flemish holiday).\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: current politicians not running in 2024 Belgian elections\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: Who is brave enough to run Belgium? - POLITICO\\nURL: https://www.politico.eu/article/next-prime-minister-belgium-election-paul-magnette-alexander-de-croo-sophie-wilmes-charles-michel-bart-de-wever/\\nCONTENT: So will the real Belgian leader please stand up?

Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament.

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: 2024 Elections - A wind of change to the right?

During his time as an MEP, Verhofstadt became notorious in the UK as the European Parliament's Brexit Coordinator from 2016 to 2020, when, among other things, he openly accused former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson of spreading \\\"disinformation\\\" about Britain's withdrawal from the EU. In addition to being the bête noire of Brexiteers, Verhofstadt also cuts a highly divisive figure in Belgium for his government's perceived fiscal profligacy as well as for his aggressive pro-Europeanism.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: Belgium: Political Developments and Data in 2023 - BAUDEWYNS - 2024 ...\\nURL: https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2047-8852.12465\\nCONTENT: No large reform was implemented as if the coalition parties were already more preoccupied with positioning themselves for the 2024 elections than achieving a pension, tax or institutional reform.

For Bart De Wever, the president of the Flemish nationalist party N-VA, “the same trend is happening across all of Europe right now.” “And as unfair as you may find that, the far right is capitalizing.” In the polls, his party, the N-VA, is now the second biggest in Flanders, after Vlaams Belang.

In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution.

To reconnect with its base and attract new supporters, the party will need to find a balance between traditional liberal principles and new solutions to issues like affordable housing, energy policy and social mobility. Critics, both within and outside the party, argue that Groen has become too much like traditional political organisations by focusing on power dynamics and internal disputes rather than bold, transformative solutions. To address these challenges, PS leader Paul Magnette has announced a “refoundation” of the party, a deep introspection aimed at rebuilding the party’s core identity and relevance in a political landscape that increasingly seems resistant to left-wing ideals of solidarity and collective responsibility.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Belgium's wannabe government unscathed in local elections, early ...\\nURL: https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-local-elections-june-dutch-flanders-flemish-elections/\\nCONTENT: October 14, 2024 4:37 am CET By Hanne Cokelaere Belgium's June election winners bolstered their positions in local elections on Sunday.

In the European Parliament elections, which also took place on Sunday, Flemish right-wing parties Vlaams Belang and N-VA each held on to their three seats in parliament.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Belgian government talks at a standstill after resignation of key ...\\nURL: https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/23/belgian-government-talks-at-a-standstill-after-resignation-of-key-negotiator\\nCONTENT: Euronews Tech Talks goes beyond discussions to explore the impact of new technologies on our lives.

Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament.

Rousseau has argued that, as the only left-leaning party, Vooruit cannot agree to a coalition that prioritises conservative fiscal reforms and tax cuts, fearing these measures would compromise social security and pensions.

In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix.

During his time as an MEP, Verhofstadt became notorious in the UK as the European Parliament's Brexit Coordinator from 2016 to 2020, when, among other things, he openly accused former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson of spreading \\\"disinformation\\\" about Britain's withdrawal from the EU. In addition to being the bête noire of Brexiteers, Verhofstadt also cuts a highly divisive figure in Belgium for his government's perceived fiscal profligacy as well as for his aggressive pro-Europeanism.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: Looking ahead: The road to reinvention for Belgium's struggling ...\\nURL: https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties\\nCONTENT: Belgium’s 2024 elections exposed significant challenges for several political parties, from the Flemish liberals to the francophone socialists. To reconnect with its base and attract new supporters, the party will need to find a balance between traditional liberal principles and new solutions to issues like affordable housing, energy policy and social mobility. Critics, both within and outside the party, argue that Groen has become too much like traditional political organisations by focusing on power dynamics and internal disputes rather than bold, transformative solutions. To address these challenges, PS leader Paul Magnette has announced a “refoundation” of the party, a deep introspection aimed at rebuilding the party’s core identity and relevance in a political landscape that increasingly seems resistant to left-wing ideals of solidarity and collective responsibility.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Belgium gets new government after 236 days of negotiations\\nURL: https://brusselssignal.eu/2025/02/belgium-gets-new-government-after-236-days-of-negotiations/\\nCONTENT: Belgium gets new government after 236 days of negotiations - Brussels Signal King Philippe of Belgium (R) and New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party Chairman Bart De Wever shake hands after their meeting at the Royal Palace in Brussels, Belgium, 31 January 2025.

In Flanders, the centre-right N-VA, led by Antwerp mayor Bart De Wever, equally surprised pollsters by managing to remain the biggest Flemish party ahead of the right-wing populist Vlaams Belang, kept out of government with a cordon sanitaire imposed by all other political parties. In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. As a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: 'Very bad time' to not have a Belgian Government: Why?\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1303116/very-bad-time-to-not-have-a-belgian-government-why\\nCONTENT: Belgians are often quite indifferent about having frequent long periods without a government – yet these fast-changing times make it a particularly bad time for the country not to have a fully functional leadership.

A notable figure is former Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who has stated that he will not run for re-election to the European Parliament, unless a pan-European candidacy becomes possible, which remains unlikely given the current electoral framework<citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/494091/former-belgian-pm-guy-verhofstadt-to-retire-from-politics-in-2024</citation>.\n\nIn addition to Verhofstadt, other prominent leaders such as Alexander De Croo, who led the Open VLD party and served as Prime Minister, may be stepping down after his party's poor performance in the recent elections. De Croo formally tendered his resignation following the elections, marking a significant shift in the political landscape that has been increasingly leaning to the right with parties like the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical-right Vlaams Belang gaining traction<citation>https://www.bulletin.be/federal-elections-belgium-shifts-right-prime-minister-set-resign</citation>.\n\nFurthermore, Paul Magnette, leader of the Socialist Party (PS), has indicated a desire to refocus his party's objectives, hinting that he may not seek re-election after the challenges faced during the electoral campaign<citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The announcement of these retirements reflects not only individual choices but also the broader political shift and challenges facing traditional parties in Belgium's evolving political landscape.\n\nThe implications of these retirements go beyond individual electability; they also signify a potential reshuffling of party dynamics and a need for new leadership as Belgium navigates the post-election landscape amidst a significant ideological shift towards the right. As the country prepares for the crucial elections on June 9, 2024, what remains to be seen is how these changes will affect party strategies and coalition possibilities moving forward.\n</answer>"

These constituencies primarily encompass the Wallonia region and the French-speaking voters in Brussels, who collectively elect representatives in the federal government.\n\nIn Wallonia, the key political players include the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR), and the centrist Les Engagés. Recent polls indicate a competitive race, with the MR emerging as a strong contender alongside PS and other left-wing parties like the Workers' Party of Belgium (PTB) gaining traction among the electorate <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The dynamics in these areas illustrate a broader trend towards consolidation for liberal parties, which have traditionally held significant influence within the Francophone community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1061134/mr-extends-its-lead-among-french-speaking-parties-in-final-election-dash</citation>.\n\nIn the Brussels-Capital Region, which serves as the administrative center of Belgium, the voting is divided into multiple electoral constituencies. French-speaking voters have the option to choose representatives from the French-speaking lists, which have tailored their campaigns to resonate with the diverse population of the city. The outcome of these elections will not only influence the structure of local government but also affect the overall composition of the federal parliament, as Brussels is a critical battleground for both Francophone and Dutch-speaking parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\nThe rise of parties advocating for regional reform, coupled with reduced voter turnout expectations, highlights an evolving political landscape for French-speaking constituencies. As the Francophone community navigates issues ranging from social equity to economic policy, the 2024 elections are seen as a pivotal moment for re-evaluating their political strategies and alliances <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the French-speaking constituencies in Belgium are central to the discourse surrounding the 2024 federal elections. The interplay between traditional parties and emerging political movements will significantly impact the direction of federal policies and governance in the nation.\n## Opinion Polls\n\nAs Belgium approaches its federal elections on June 9, 2024, a range of opinion polls have been conducted to gauge public sentiment and voting intentions across the country. These polls reflect the changing political landscape and the dynamics among various parties since the last federal election in May 2019.\n\nThe most recent poll conducted by Ipsos shows notable support for the major parties, with the Liberal Reformist Party (MR) leading at 27.4%, followed closely by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%. Other parties, including the Green parties (Ecolo) at 8.1% and the left-wing Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA/PTB) at 12.9%, are also represented in the polls <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/institute/ipsos</citation>.\n\nIn addition to the Ipsos poll, a comprehensive survey conducted from May 28 to May 31, 2024, indicates that the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical right-wing party Vlaams Belang (VB) remain significant contenders in the Flemish region, although exact percentages were not disclosed <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The context is critical, as the country has experienced increasing political polarization and shifting alliances in the run-up to this election. \n\nAs political uncertainty looms, the latest predictions suggest that the current governing coalition, comprised of diverse political factions, could see a reduction in seats, complicating the formation of future governing coalitions <citation>https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/country-risk/rising-political-polarisation-ahead-belgian-federal-elections-17-04-2024</citation>.\n\nThese opinion polls not only provide insight into voter preferences but also highlight the potential consequences of political alliances and the overall stability of the Belgian government heading into 2024. The ensuing months will be critical as parties ramp up their campaigns and attempt to sway undecided voters in a landscape marked by fragmentation and multiple parties vying for influence.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to take place on June 9, 2024, coinciding with regional and European Parliament elections. This election holds significant importance as it represents a crucial moment in Belgium's intricate political landscape, shaped by a complex system of governance that includes both federal and regional authorities <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/belgium-2024-election.html</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Belgium has been characterized by a fragmented political system marked by linguistic and regional divisions between the Dutch-speaking Flanders region and the French-speaking Wallonia. The elections are expected to be a pivotal point for various political parties, particularly with the anticipated rise of right-wing and far-right factions, such as the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and Vlaams Belang (VB), which have been polling strongly <citation>https://politico.eu/article/belgium-far-right-election-extremist-landslide-elections-in-europe-results-2024/</citation>. These parties' prominence reflects broader trends across Europe, where populist sentiments have gained significant traction in recent years.\n\nThe Federal Parliament of Belgium consists of a bicameral system, including the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. Political dynamics are led by coalition-based governance, where no single party has achieved a clear majority since World War I. As Belgium moves towards the 2024 elections, numerous coalitions are being envisioned, including the potential resurgence of a center-right coalition comprising the N-VA, the liberals (Open VLD and MR), and elements of the Christian Democrats <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>.\n\nThe expectation of low voter turnout, the lowest since 1893, adds another layer of complexity to the elections, suggesting potential voter disengagement amid a tumultuous political climate shaped by economic challenges, social issues, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nAs the campaigning intensifies, political leaders and parties will be keenly navigating the landscape to secure necessary coalitions to govern, reflecting the shifting allegiances and priorities of the Belgian electorate. The outcome of these elections could greatly influence Belgium’s domestic and European policy directions in the coming years.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, represented a significant moment in Belgium's political landscape. As the first federal election post-COVID-19 pandemic, these elections not only concerned the immediate political climate but also reflected underlying trends in voter sentiment and party dynamics, marking a pivotal transition in the nation's governance.\n\nBelgium's electoral structure is complex, comprising three separate parliaments—at federal, regional, and European levels—and these elections included contests for all 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives, alongside regional and EU elections. This layered governance system plays a crucial role in shaping the country's political discourse.\n\nPre-election polls indicated a concerning trend towards the right, with the far-right Vlaams Belang party emerging as a leading contender, projected to capture a significant portion of the electorate. This shift towards populism and radical ideologies raised alarms about the potential implications for coalition politics and governance in Belgium, a country known for its intricate power-sharing arrangements amidst linguistic divides between the Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia.\n\nDespite fears of a far-right transformation, preliminary results post-election suggest a nuanced outcome: while the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) retained a significant share of votes, Vlaams Belang's expected surge did not materialize into an outright dominance. Instead, the results pointed to a continuing fragmentation of the political landscape and an anticipated struggle to form stable coalitions, echoing the ongoing challenges of Belgian governance in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nThis report will delve into the results, candidate profiles, and potential coalition formations emanating from this election, seeking to provide a clear overview of the current state of Belgian politics post-2024 federal elections and its broader implications for the nation. For further insights, one can refer to articles such as \"Belgium's 2024 Elections: A Shift to the Right, Though Less Extreme Than Expected\" <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation>, and analysis from \"The 2024 Belgian federal elections: a race to the right\" <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nEssentially, the 2024 elections not only serve as a barometer of current political sentiments but also set the stage for the future trajectory of governance and political debates in Belgium, amidst challenges of unity and representation.\n## Retiring Incumbents\n\nAs Belgium approaches the 2024 federal elections, several incumbent politicians have announced their decision not to seek re-election. A notable figure is former Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who has stated that he will not run for re-election to the European Parliament, unless a pan-European candidacy becomes possible, which remains unlikely given the current electoral framework<citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/494091/former-belgian-pm-guy-verhofstadt-to-retire-from-politics-in-2024</citation>.\n\nIn addition to Verhofstadt, other prominent leaders such as Alexander De Croo, who led the Open VLD party and served as Prime Minister, may be stepping down after his party's poor performance in the recent elections. De Croo formally tendered his resignation following the elections, marking a significant shift in the political landscape that has been increasingly leaning to the right with parties like the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical-right Vlaams Belang gaining traction<citation>https://www.bulletin.be/federal-elections-belgium-shifts-right-prime-minister-set-resign</citation>.\n\nFurthermore, Paul Magnette, leader of the Socialist Party (PS), has indicated a desire to refocus his party's objectives, hinting that he may not seek re-election after the challenges faced during the electoral campaign<citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The announcement of these retirements reflects not only individual choices but also the broader political shift and challenges facing traditional parties in Belgium's evolving political landscape.\n\nThe implications of these retirements go beyond individual electability; they also signify a potential reshuffling of party dynamics and a need for new leadership as Belgium navigates the post-election landscape amidst a significant ideological shift towards the right. As the country prepares for the crucial elections on June 9, 2024, what remains to be seen is how these changes will affect party strategies and coalition possibilities moving forward.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Senate\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

When asked about the reasons behind the Workers' Party's breakthrough in the kingdom's French-speaking community since the previous general elections on 26 May 2019, Emilie van Haute, professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels, explains: \\\"The nature of the public debate is quite different: in Flanders, it is much more focused on migration issues, which is very favourable to Vlaams Belang, the party that has made these issues its main campaign theme.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections 2024: results and potential coalitions\\nURL: https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/\\nCONTENT: At federal level, Vivaldi II is unlikely: the outgoing centre-left “Vivaldi” coalition composed of socialists, liberals, greens (of both Dutch- and French-speaking parties) as well as CD&V (Dutch-speaking christian democrats, EPP) gathered a very narrow majority of 76 seats.

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件，要求简单清晰即可\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe French-speaking constituencies in Belgium play a significant role in shaping the political landscape, particularly during the upcoming 2024 federal elections set for June 9. These constituencies primarily encompass the Wallonia region and the French-speaking voters in Brussels, who collectively elect representatives in the federal government.\n\nIn Wallonia, the key political players include the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR), and the centrist Les Engagés. Recent polls indicate a competitive race, with the MR emerging as a strong contender alongside PS and other left-wing parties like the Workers' Party of Belgium (PTB) gaining traction among the electorate <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The dynamics in these areas illustrate a broader trend towards consolidation for liberal parties, which have traditionally held significant influence within the Francophone community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1061134/mr-extends-its-lead-among-french-speaking-parties-in-final-election-dash</citation>.\n\nIn the Brussels-Capital Region, which serves as the administrative center of Belgium, the voting is divided into multiple electoral constituencies. French-speaking voters have the option to choose representatives from the French-speaking lists, which have tailored their campaigns to resonate with the diverse population of the city. The outcome of these elections will not only influence the structure of local government but also affect the overall composition of the federal parliament, as Brussels is a critical battleground for both Francophone and Dutch-speaking parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\nThe rise of parties advocating for regional reform, coupled with reduced voter turnout expectations, highlights an evolving political landscape for French-speaking constituencies. As the Francophone community navigates issues ranging from social equity to economic policy, the 2024 elections are seen as a pivotal moment for re-evaluating their political strategies and alliances <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the French-speaking constituencies in Belgium are central to the discourse surrounding the 2024 federal elections. The interplay between traditional parties and emerging political movements will significantly impact the direction of federal policies and governance in the nation.\n## Opinion Polls\n\nAs Belgium approaches its federal elections on June 9, 2024, a range of opinion polls have been conducted to gauge public sentiment and voting intentions across the country. These polls reflect the changing political landscape and the dynamics among various parties since the last federal election in May 2019.\n\nThe most recent poll conducted by Ipsos shows notable support for the major parties, with the Liberal Reformist Party (MR) leading at 27.4%, followed closely by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%. Other parties, including the Green parties (Ecolo) at 8.1% and the left-wing Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA/PTB) at 12.9%, are also represented in the polls <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/institute/ipsos</citation>.\n\nIn addition to the Ipsos poll, a comprehensive survey conducted from May 28 to May 31, 2024, indicates that the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical right-wing party Vlaams Belang (VB) remain significant contenders in the Flemish region, although exact percentages were not disclosed <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The context is critical, as the country has experienced increasing political polarization and shifting alliances in the run-up to this election. \n\nAs political uncertainty looms, the latest predictions suggest that the current governing coalition, comprised of diverse political factions, could see a reduction in seats, complicating the formation of future governing coalitions <citation>https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/country-risk/rising-political-polarisation-ahead-belgian-federal-elections-17-04-2024</citation>.\n\nThese opinion polls not only provide insight into voter preferences but also highlight the potential consequences of political alliances and the overall stability of the Belgian government heading into 2024. The ensuing months will be critical as parties ramp up their campaigns and attempt to sway undecided voters in a landscape marked by fragmentation and multiple parties vying for influence.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to take place on June 9, 2024, coinciding with regional and European Parliament elections. This election holds significant importance as it represents a crucial moment in Belgium's intricate political landscape, shaped by a complex system of governance that includes both federal and regional authorities <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/belgium-2024-election.html</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Belgium has been characterized by a fragmented political system marked by linguistic and regional divisions between the Dutch-speaking Flanders region and the French-speaking Wallonia. The elections are expected to be a pivotal point for various political parties, particularly with the anticipated rise of right-wing and far-right factions, such as the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and Vlaams Belang (VB), which have been polling strongly <citation>https://politico.eu/article/belgium-far-right-election-extremist-landslide-elections-in-europe-results-2024/</citation>. These parties' prominence reflects broader trends across Europe, where populist sentiments have gained significant traction in recent years.\n\nThe Federal Parliament of Belgium consists of a bicameral system, including the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. Political dynamics are led by coalition-based governance, where no single party has achieved a clear majority since World War I. As Belgium moves towards the 2024 elections, numerous coalitions are being envisioned, including the potential resurgence of a center-right coalition comprising the N-VA, the liberals (Open VLD and MR), and elements of the Christian Democrats <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>.\n\nThe expectation of low voter turnout, the lowest since 1893, adds another layer of complexity to the elections, suggesting potential voter disengagement amid a tumultuous political climate shaped by economic challenges, social issues, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nAs the campaigning intensifies, political leaders and parties will be keenly navigating the landscape to secure necessary coalitions to govern, reflecting the shifting allegiances and priorities of the Belgian electorate. The outcome of these elections could greatly influence Belgium’s domestic and European policy directions in the coming years.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, represented a significant moment in Belgium's political landscape. As the first federal election post-COVID-19 pandemic, these elections not only concerned the immediate political climate but also reflected underlying trends in voter sentiment and party dynamics, marking a pivotal transition in the nation's governance.\n\nBelgium's electoral structure is complex, comprising three separate parliaments—at federal, regional, and European levels—and these elections included contests for all 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives, alongside regional and EU elections. This layered governance system plays a crucial role in shaping the country's political discourse.\n\nPre-election polls indicated a concerning trend towards the right, with the far-right Vlaams Belang party emerging as a leading contender, projected to capture a significant portion of the electorate. This shift towards populism and radical ideologies raised alarms about the potential implications for coalition politics and governance in Belgium, a country known for its intricate power-sharing arrangements amidst linguistic divides between the Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia.\n\nDespite fears of a far-right transformation, preliminary results post-election suggest a nuanced outcome: while the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) retained a significant share of votes, Vlaams Belang's expected surge did not materialize into an outright dominance. Instead, the results pointed to a continuing fragmentation of the political landscape and an anticipated struggle to form stable coalitions, echoing the ongoing challenges of Belgian governance in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nThis report will delve into the results, candidate profiles, and potential coalition formations emanating from this election, seeking to provide a clear overview of the current state of Belgian politics post-2024 federal elections and its broader implications for the nation. For further insights, one can refer to articles such as \"Belgium's 2024 Elections: A Shift to the Right, Though Less Extreme Than Expected\" <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation>, and analysis from \"The 2024 Belgian federal elections: a race to the right\" <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nEssentially, the 2024 elections not only serve as a barometer of current political sentiments but also set the stage for the future trajectory of governance and political debates in Belgium, amidst challenges of unity and representation.\n## Retiring Incumbents\n\nAs Belgium approaches the 2024 federal elections, several incumbent politicians have announced their decision not to seek re-election. A notable figure is former Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who has stated that he will not run for re-election to the European Parliament, unless a pan-European candidacy becomes possible, which remains unlikely given the current electoral framework<citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/494091/former-belgian-pm-guy-verhofstadt-to-retire-from-politics-in-2024</citation>.\n\nIn addition to Verhofstadt, other prominent leaders such as Alexander De Croo, who led the Open VLD party and served as Prime Minister, may be stepping down after his party's poor performance in the recent elections. De Croo formally tendered his resignation following the elections, marking a significant shift in the political landscape that has been increasingly leaning to the right with parties like the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical-right Vlaams Belang gaining traction<citation>https://www.bulletin.be/federal-elections-belgium-shifts-right-prime-minister-set-resign</citation>.\n\nFurthermore, Paul Magnette, leader of the Socialist Party (PS), has indicated a desire to refocus his party's objectives, hinting that he may not seek re-election after the challenges faced during the electoral campaign<citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The announcement of these retirements reflects not only individual choices but also the broader political shift and challenges facing traditional parties in Belgium's evolving political landscape.\n\nThe implications of these retirements go beyond individual electability; they also signify a potential reshuffling of party dynamics and a need for new leadership as Belgium navigates the post-election landscape amidst a significant ideological shift towards the right. As the country prepares for the crucial elections on June 9, 2024, what remains to be seen is how these changes will affect party strategies and coalition possibilities moving forward.\n### Senate\n\nThe Belgian Senate, part of the country's bicameral parliament, plays a unique role in the political landscape. In the upcoming 2024 Belgian federal elections, the Senate will undergo specific changes in its composition and functioning. Currently, the Senate consists of 60 members, of which 50 senators are appointed by the parliaments of the communities and regions, while 10 are co-opted based on the parties' electoral performance in federal elections <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/22/</citation>.\n\nIt is important to note that there will be no direct elections for the Senate during the 2024 federal elections scheduled for June 9. The Senate's makeup remains stable, according to the current law, which means that its members will not be renewed during this election cycle. This reflects an ongoing trend since 2014, when the process for filling Senate seats transitioned to one primarily based on appointments rather than direct elections <citation>https://www.senaat.be/event/20240422-elections2024/20240524-elections2024_nl.html</citation>.\n\nThe composition of the Senate can influence the formation of coalitions at the federal level, as it represents additional political interests and regional perspectives. The last major gathering of information indicated that as political dynamics evolve, the Flemish nationalist party, N-VA, has emerged as a significant force within this body, securing the largest group of seats, which points towards a potential stalemate or collaboration with other parties within the Senate <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, while the 2024 federal elections will bring changes in the Chamber of Representatives, the Senate will remain unchanged in terms of its elected officials this cycle, serving as a reminder of the complex dynamics that shape Belgian politics and governance. The role of the Senate will continue to be crucial, especially in a political environment characterized by the need for coalition cooperation and regional representation <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Electoral system\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

        "value": "<answer>\n## Electoral System\n\nThe electoral system in Belgium is characterized by its use of proportional representation, which is designed to ensure that the distribution of seats in the Chamber of Representatives reflects the overall votes received by political parties. Federal elections, including the 2024 Belgian federal elections, occur every five years and are held concurrently with regional and European elections, allowing voters to cast ballots for multiple layers of governance on the same day, which was scheduled for 9 June 2024 <citation>https://www.electionpassport.com/electoral-systems/belgium/</citation>.\n\nBelgium's electoral structure has undergone significant changes, especially following the sixth state reform in December 2011, which enhanced the autonomy of regional governments. As a result, the federal Senate has transitioned into a regional chamber that represents the various federal entities of Belgium. The Chamber of Representatives consists of 150 members, all elected through a system known as D'Hondt, a method of party-list proportional representation. Under this system, voters in each electoral district cast their votes for a party, and then the seats are allocated based on the overall proportion of votes each party receives <citation>https://electiopedia.com/elections-in-belgium/</citation>.\n\nIn Belgium, voting is compulsory, meaning that it is required for eligible citizens to participate in elections, which has implications for voter turnout and political engagement. Approximately 7.7 million citizens are eligible to vote, and the law mandates participation from all individuals aged 18 and over <citation>https://www.reuters.com/article/world/factbox-key-facts-about-belgiums-electoral-system-idUSL10246183/</citation>. The 2024 elections are notable as they also include a provision allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in European elections, reflecting a broader trend toward increasing youth engagement in the democratic process <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>.\n\nThis electoral framework aims to facilitate a diverse political representation, giving smaller parties a chance to gain seats proportional to their support among the electorate. The coalition nature of Belgian politics often leads to fragmented parliaments, necessitating the formation of multi-party coalitions to establish a government <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008651/belgian-elections-for-dummies</citation>.\n\nIn conclusion, the electoral system of Belgium is instrumental in shaping its complex political landscape, promoting a multiparty environment where diverse political opinions can be represented within the federal structure. The proportional representation system not only allows for equitable representation of parties in the Chamber of Representatives but also underscores the importance of voter participation in maintaining democratic integrity within the nation.\n</answer>"

These constituencies primarily encompass the Wallonia region and the French-speaking voters in Brussels, who collectively elect representatives in the federal government.\n\nIn Wallonia, the key political players include the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR), and the centrist Les Engagés. Recent polls indicate a competitive race, with the MR emerging as a strong contender alongside PS and other left-wing parties like the Workers' Party of Belgium (PTB) gaining traction among the electorate <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The dynamics in these areas illustrate a broader trend towards consolidation for liberal parties, which have traditionally held significant influence within the Francophone community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1061134/mr-extends-its-lead-among-french-speaking-parties-in-final-election-dash</citation>.\n\nIn the Brussels-Capital Region, which serves as the administrative center of Belgium, the voting is divided into multiple electoral constituencies. French-speaking voters have the option to choose representatives from the French-speaking lists, which have tailored their campaigns to resonate with the diverse population of the city. The outcome of these elections will not only influence the structure of local government but also affect the overall composition of the federal parliament, as Brussels is a critical battleground for both Francophone and Dutch-speaking parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\nThe rise of parties advocating for regional reform, coupled with reduced voter turnout expectations, highlights an evolving political landscape for French-speaking constituencies. As the Francophone community navigates issues ranging from social equity to economic policy, the 2024 elections are seen as a pivotal moment for re-evaluating their political strategies and alliances <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the French-speaking constituencies in Belgium are central to the discourse surrounding the 2024 federal elections. The interplay between traditional parties and emerging political movements will significantly impact the direction of federal policies and governance in the nation.\n## Opinion Polls\n\nAs Belgium approaches its federal elections on June 9, 2024, a range of opinion polls have been conducted to gauge public sentiment and voting intentions across the country. These polls reflect the changing political landscape and the dynamics among various parties since the last federal election in May 2019.\n\nThe most recent poll conducted by Ipsos shows notable support for the major parties, with the Liberal Reformist Party (MR) leading at 27.4%, followed closely by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%. Other parties, including the Green parties (Ecolo) at 8.1% and the left-wing Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA/PTB) at 12.9%, are also represented in the polls <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/institute/ipsos</citation>.\n\nIn addition to the Ipsos poll, a comprehensive survey conducted from May 28 to May 31, 2024, indicates that the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical right-wing party Vlaams Belang (VB) remain significant contenders in the Flemish region, although exact percentages were not disclosed <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The context is critical, as the country has experienced increasing political polarization and shifting alliances in the run-up to this election. \n\nAs political uncertainty looms, the latest predictions suggest that the current governing coalition, comprised of diverse political factions, could see a reduction in seats, complicating the formation of future governing coalitions <citation>https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/country-risk/rising-political-polarisation-ahead-belgian-federal-elections-17-04-2024</citation>.\n\nThese opinion polls not only provide insight into voter preferences but also highlight the potential consequences of political alliances and the overall stability of the Belgian government heading into 2024. The ensuing months will be critical as parties ramp up their campaigns and attempt to sway undecided voters in a landscape marked by fragmentation and multiple parties vying for influence.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to take place on June 9, 2024, coinciding with regional and European Parliament elections. This election holds significant importance as it represents a crucial moment in Belgium's intricate political landscape, shaped by a complex system of governance that includes both federal and regional authorities <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/belgium-2024-election.html</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Belgium has been characterized by a fragmented political system marked by linguistic and regional divisions between the Dutch-speaking Flanders region and the French-speaking Wallonia. The elections are expected to be a pivotal point for various political parties, particularly with the anticipated rise of right-wing and far-right factions, such as the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and Vlaams Belang (VB), which have been polling strongly <citation>https://politico.eu/article/belgium-far-right-election-extremist-landslide-elections-in-europe-results-2024/</citation>. These parties' prominence reflects broader trends across Europe, where populist sentiments have gained significant traction in recent years.\n\nThe Federal Parliament of Belgium consists of a bicameral system, including the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. Political dynamics are led by coalition-based governance, where no single party has achieved a clear majority since World War I. As Belgium moves towards the 2024 elections, numerous coalitions are being envisioned, including the potential resurgence of a center-right coalition comprising the N-VA, the liberals (Open VLD and MR), and elements of the Christian Democrats <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>.\n\nThe expectation of low voter turnout, the lowest since 1893, adds another layer of complexity to the elections, suggesting potential voter disengagement amid a tumultuous political climate shaped by economic challenges, social issues, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nAs the campaigning intensifies, political leaders and parties will be keenly navigating the landscape to secure necessary coalitions to govern, reflecting the shifting allegiances and priorities of the Belgian electorate. The outcome of these elections could greatly influence Belgium’s domestic and European policy directions in the coming years.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, represented a significant moment in Belgium's political landscape. As the first federal election post-COVID-19 pandemic, these elections not only concerned the immediate political climate but also reflected underlying trends in voter sentiment and party dynamics, marking a pivotal transition in the nation's governance.\n\nBelgium's electoral structure is complex, comprising three separate parliaments—at federal, regional, and European levels—and these elections included contests for all 150 seats in the Chamber of Representatives, alongside regional and EU elections. This layered governance system plays a crucial role in shaping the country's political discourse.\n\nPre-election polls indicated a concerning trend towards the right, with the far-right Vlaams Belang party emerging as a leading contender, projected to capture a significant portion of the electorate. This shift towards populism and radical ideologies raised alarms about the potential implications for coalition politics and governance in Belgium, a country known for its intricate power-sharing arrangements amidst linguistic divides between the Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia.\n\nDespite fears of a far-right transformation, preliminary results post-election suggest a nuanced outcome: while the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) retained a significant share of votes, Vlaams Belang's expected surge did not materialize into an outright dominance. Instead, the results pointed to a continuing fragmentation of the political landscape and an anticipated struggle to form stable coalitions, echoing the ongoing challenges of Belgian governance in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nThis report will delve into the results, candidate profiles, and potential coalition formations emanating from this election, seeking to provide a clear overview of the current state of Belgian politics post-2024 federal elections and its broader implications for the nation. For further insights, one can refer to articles such as \"Belgium's 2024 Elections: A Shift to the Right, Though Less Extreme Than Expected\" <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation>, and analysis from \"The 2024 Belgian federal elections: a race to the right\" <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nEssentially, the 2024 elections not only serve as a barometer of current political sentiments but also set the stage for the future trajectory of governance and political debates in Belgium, amidst challenges of unity and representation.\n## Retiring Incumbents\n\nAs Belgium approaches the 2024 federal elections, several incumbent politicians have announced their decision not to seek re-election. A notable figure is former Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who has stated that he will not run for re-election to the European Parliament, unless a pan-European candidacy becomes possible, which remains unlikely given the current electoral framework<citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/494091/former-belgian-pm-guy-verhofstadt-to-retire-from-politics-in-2024</citation>.\n\nIn addition to Verhofstadt, other prominent leaders such as Alexander De Croo, who led the Open VLD party and served as Prime Minister, may be stepping down after his party's poor performance in the recent elections. De Croo formally tendered his resignation following the elections, marking a significant shift in the political landscape that has been increasingly leaning to the right with parties like the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the radical-right Vlaams Belang gaining traction<citation>https://www.bulletin.be/federal-elections-belgium-shifts-right-prime-minister-set-resign</citation>.\n\nFurthermore, Paul Magnette, leader of the Socialist Party (PS), has indicated a desire to refocus his party's objectives, hinting that he may not seek re-election after the challenges faced during the electoral campaign<citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties</citation>. The announcement of these retirements reflects not only individual choices but also the broader political shift and challenges facing traditional parties in Belgium's evolving political landscape.\n\nThe implications of these retirements go beyond individual electability; they also signify a potential reshuffling of party dynamics and a need for new leadership as Belgium navigates the post-election landscape amidst a significant ideological shift towards the right. As the country prepares for the crucial elections on June 9, 2024, what remains to be seen is how these changes will affect party strategies and coalition possibilities moving forward.\n### Senate\n\nThe Belgian Senate, part of the country's bicameral parliament, plays a unique role in the political landscape. In the upcoming 2024 Belgian federal elections, the Senate will undergo specific changes in its composition and functioning. Currently, the Senate consists of 60 members, of which 50 senators are appointed by the parliaments of the communities and regions, while 10 are co-opted based on the parties' electoral performance in federal elections <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/22/</citation>.\n\nIt is important to note that there will be no direct elections for the Senate during the 2024 federal elections scheduled for June 9. The Senate's makeup remains stable, according to the current law, which means that its members will not be renewed during this election cycle. This reflects an ongoing trend since 2014, when the process for filling Senate seats transitioned to one primarily based on appointments rather than direct elections <citation>https://www.senaat.be/event/20240422-elections2024/20240524-elections2024_nl.html</citation>.\n\nThe composition of the Senate can influence the formation of coalitions at the federal level, as it represents additional political interests and regional perspectives. The last major gathering of information indicated that as political dynamics evolve, the Flemish nationalist party, N-VA, has emerged as a significant force within this body, securing the largest group of seats, which points towards a potential stalemate or collaboration with other parties within the Senate <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, while the 2024 federal elections will bring changes in the Chamber of Representatives, the Senate will remain unchanged in terms of its elected officials this cycle, serving as a reminder of the complex dynamics that shape Belgian politics and governance. The role of the Senate will continue to be crucial, especially in a political environment characterized by the need for coalition cooperation and regional representation <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>.\n## Electoral System\n\nThe electoral system in Belgium is characterized by its use of proportional representation, which is designed to ensure that the distribution of seats in the Chamber of Representatives reflects the overall votes received by political parties. Federal elections, including the 2024 Belgian federal elections, occur every five years and are held concurrently with regional and European elections, allowing voters to cast ballots for multiple layers of governance on the same day, which was scheduled for 9 June 2024 <citation>https://www.electionpassport.com/electoral-systems/belgium/</citation>.\n\nBelgium's electoral structure has undergone significant changes, especially following the sixth state reform in December 2011, which enhanced the autonomy of regional governments. As a result, the federal Senate has transitioned into a regional chamber that represents the various federal entities of Belgium. The Chamber of Representatives consists of 150 members, all elected through a system known as D'Hondt, a method of party-list proportional representation. Under this system, voters in each electoral district cast their votes for a party, and then the seats are allocated based on the overall proportion of votes each party receives <citation>https://electiopedia.com/elections-in-belgium/</citation>.\n\nIn Belgium, voting is compulsory, meaning that it is required for eligible citizens to participate in elections, which has implications for voter turnout and political engagement. Approximately 7.7 million citizens are eligible to vote, and the law mandates participation from all individuals aged 18 and over <citation>https://www.reuters.com/article/world/factbox-key-facts-about-belgiums-electoral-system-idUSL10246183/</citation>. The 2024 elections are notable as they also include a provision allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in European elections, reflecting a broader trend toward increasing youth engagement in the democratic process <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>.\n\nThis electoral framework aims to facilitate a diverse political representation, giving smaller parties a chance to gain seats proportional to their support among the electorate. The coalition nature of Belgian politics often leads to fragmented parliaments, necessitating the formation of multi-party coalitions to establish a government <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008651/belgian-elections-for-dummies</citation>.\n\nIn conclusion, the electoral system of Belgium is instrumental in shaping its complex political landscape, promoting a multiparty environment where diverse political opinions can be represented within the federal structure. The proportional representation system not only allows for equitable representation of parties in the Chamber of Representatives but also underscores the importance of voter participation in maintaining democratic integrity within the nation.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Aftermath\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix.

De Croo handed over his resignation as prime minister to the country’s King Philippe, a procedural step after which the king meets with leaders of Belgium’s biggest parties: N-VA’s De Wever first, Vlaams Belang’s Tom Van Grieken second and MR’s Bouchez third.

Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament. Another coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: Belgium's 2024 Elections: A Shift to the Right, Though Less Extreme ...\\nURL: https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/\\nCONTENT: In the northern Dutch-speaking region of Flanders, the conservative-nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) secured its place as largest party with 23.9 percent of the Flemish vote, closely followed by the populist radical right Vlaams Belang (VB) with 22.7 percent. In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: At Last, a Government: New Belgian Coalition Ponders Reforms\\nURL: https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/\\nCONTENT: Consolidated federal finances and tighter immigration policies take priority over Flemish self-government for the ideologically diverse coalition. In Flanders, the centre-right N-VA, led by Antwerp mayor Bart De Wever, equally surprised pollsters by managing to remain the biggest Flemish party ahead of the right-wing populist Vlaams Belang, kept out of government with a cordon sanitaire imposed by all other political parties. In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. As a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: 2024 Belgian federal election results analysis\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: The 2024 Belgian federal elections: a race to the right\\nURL: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986\\nCONTENT: The Belgian federal elections held on 9 June 2024 marked a turning point in the country's political history.

The elections resulted in a noteworthy shift towards the right, with the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the Francophone liberal Reformist Movement (MR) emerging as the biggest winners. N-VA secured 25.6% of the Flemish votes, maintaining its status as the largest party in Belgium, while MR followed with 20 seats in the Federal Parliament <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>.\n\nThe elections were characterized by one of the lowest voter turnouts since compulsory voting was introduced in 1893, indicative of public dissatisfaction and disengagement from the political process <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. This effectively shaped a political landscape where radical parties received unprecedented support, reflecting a growing polarization among the electorate. This trend towards the radical right was underscored by the performance of the Vlaams Belang, which, despite coming in a close second to N-VA with 21.8% of the votes, saw substantial gains from previous elections <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-far-right-election-extremist-landslide-elections-in-europe-results-2024</citation>.\n\nFollowing the elections, the resignation of Prime Minister Alexander De Croo was a procedural step marking the transition of power, as he handed over authority to King Philippe, who is set to consult with the leaders of the newly elected parties <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>. The impending coalition negotiations are anticipated to be complex, as the political scene in Belgium has always been fragmented.\n\nInterest in potential coalitions has heightened, with discussions around a revival of past coalitions and the dynamics between Flemish and Francophone parties becoming increasingly crucial. The challenge now lies in building a stable government capable of addressing growing public concerns, particularly in areas like immigration policy and fiscal reform, while also responding to nationalist sentiments in Flanders <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2024 Belgian federal election aftermath highlights a pivotal moment in the country's governance, marked by right-wing victories and a potential realignment in coalition politics. The extent to which these results will influence future policy directions and governance remains to be seen as the newly elected parties navigate negotiations in a highly polarized environment.\n</answer>"

For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Execute safe mathematical expressions.\\n\\nSupports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **) and common mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc.).\\nFor security reasons, only mathematical expressions are allowed, no arbitrary code execution.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Mathematical expression to calculate, e.g., \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\", \\\"sin(30 * pi / 180)\\\", \\\"sqrt(16)\\\"\"}}, \"required\": [\"expression\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline. The string is intended for model consumption\\n    and retains original <note>...</note> formatting.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        None\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        str: All notes concatenated with '\\n', or an empty string if none exist.\\n\\n    Raises:\\n        RuntimeError: If session_id is not set.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {}, \"required\": [], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}]\n\n## Tool Use Rules\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n",
