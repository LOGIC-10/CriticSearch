When asked about the reasons behind the Workers' Party's breakthrough in the kingdom's French-speaking community since the previous general elections on 26 May 2019, Emilie van Haute, professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels, explains: \"The nature of the public debate is quite different: in Flanders, it is much more focused on migration issues, which is very favourable to Vlaams Belang, the party that has made these issues its main campaign theme.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[4]:\nTITLE: Belgium's 2024 Elections: A Shift to the Right, Though Less Extreme ...\nURL: https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/\nCONTENT: In the northern Dutch-speaking region of Flanders, the conservative-nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) secured its place as largest party with 23.9 percent of the Flemish vote, closely followed by the populist radical right Vlaams Belang (VB) with 22.7 percent. In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[5]:\nTITLE: Belgium's make-or-break election, explained - POLITICO\nURL: https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/\nCONTENT: The far-right Vlaams Belang is polling to win up to 27 percent of Flemish votes, making it the largest party in the country — in line with Europe’s expected far-right surge.

In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix. On the opposite side, the right and centre-right parties harboured a landslide victory totalling 26 seats for MR and 17 seats for Les Engagés in the Walloon Parliament allowing both parties to form a centre-right coalition government.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[7]:\nTITLE: Belgium: the 2024 federal elections - deadlock ahead?\nURL: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/\nCONTENT: Since October 2020, Belgium has been governed by a coalition of seven parties (the so-called “Vivaldi” coalition) – excluding the two largest parties in Flanders, the N-VA and VB – with Alexander De Croo, leading figure of the Open Vld, as prime minister. Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament. Another coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[8]:\nTITLE: Belgian elections guide: What Belgium's parties stand for\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/1010080/belgian-elections-guide-2024\nCONTENT: Belgian elections guide: What Belgium's parties stand for.

Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[8]:\nTITLE: At Last, a Government: New Belgian Coalition Ponders Reforms\nURL: https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/\nCONTENT: Consolidated federal finances and tighter immigration policies take priority over Flemish self-government for the ideologically diverse coalition.

In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. As a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\n--------------------------------------------------Query: 2024 Belgian federal election results consequences\nSearch Results:\n--------------------------------------------------\n[1]:\nTITLE: The 2024 Belgian federal elections: a race to the right\nURL: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986\nCONTENT: The Belgian federal elections held on 9 June 2024 marked a turning point in the country's political history.

    "final_report": "#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, were marked by significant political shifts within the French-speaking constituencies, specifically in Wallonia and Brussels. In these regions, the main political players include the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), the Socialist Party (PS), and Écolo, alongside emerging parties such as the Belgian Workers' Party (PTB).\n\nIn Wallonia, the MR experienced a notable surge in support, becoming the largest French-speaking party for the first time in many years, capturing approximately 26% of the vote. This was a substantial increase from their 2019 performance, which only garnered around 16.9% of the votes. The PS, historically a dominant force in French-speaking politics, suffered a decline, securing only about 8.05% of votes and losing several seats, which underscored a shift in the political landscape toward more liberal governance within the French-speaking community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>.\n\nIn Brussels, the voting dynamics reflected a similar pattern with MR leading the French-speaking candidates, followed closely by the PTB and the PS. The latter faced setbacks, indicating a change in voter preferences and priorities that were heavily influenced by issues such as migration and civil rights, which have gained prominence in recent electoral debates <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected</citation>.\n\nThe significant outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies pointed to an overall political realignment in Belgium, where voters showed a tendency towards more centrist and liberal parties amid a backdrop of growing right-wing sentiments throughout the country. This shift may have substantial implications for the formation of the next government, as coalition-building will be essential in navigating the divided political landscape brought forth by this election cycle <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nAs parties continue to navigate the results, it remains to be seen how these shifts will influence not just local governance but also federal coalitions and policies moving forward into the post-election period.\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal election approaches, opinion polls are becoming increasingly significant in gauging potential voting patterns and political preferences among the electorate. Various polling organizations have conducted surveys to assess the public's voting intentions, with results indicating a competitive political landscape.\n\nAccording to the latest Ipsos poll conducted between November 18 and 21, 2024, the following voting intentions emerged: the liberal party Mouvement Réformateur (MR) leads with 27.4%, followed by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%, the Environmentalist party Ecolo at 8.1%, and the Leftist party PVDA/PTB at 12.9% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/61534/ipsos/2024-11-21</citation>. This data reflects the diverse political affiliations within Belgium, where voters are influenced by both regional and ideological divides.\n\nAnalysis of the polling data indicates that Flemish parties, particularly the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), have historically fared well in previous elections. The N-VA continues to play a pivotal role in Flemish politics, appealing to a significant portion of the electorate. However, the radical right party Vlaams Belang also maintains a considerable support base, presenting a challenge to traditional parties in Flanders.\n\nIn contrast, the political landscape in Wallonia is dominated by different dynamics, primarily shaped by the PS and MR. Recent polls show that these parties are vying for votes as they attempt to expand their influence across Belgium. The diversity of party support underscores the complexity of Belgian politics, where coalition-building remains a crucial aspect of governance <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nOverall, as the election date approaches on June 9, 2024, the opinion polls highlight not only the shifting preferences among the electorate but also the potential for unexpected outcomes, as historical voting patterns may not entirely predict future results. Close observation of these trends will be essential to understanding the implications for Belgium's governance in the coming years.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are scheduled to take place on June 9, marking a pivotal moment in Belgium's political landscape. This election will be the first federal vote post-pandemic, a period characterized by increased political polarization and shifting voter sentiments. Historical context reveals that these elections could see one of the lowest turnouts since the introduction of compulsory voting in 1893, reflecting lingering public discontent and disengagement with the political process <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nThis election is notable for the significant shift towards right-leaning politics, highlighted by the rise of populist and far-right parties such as Vlaams Belang (VB) and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA). Polls indicate that these parties are likely to dominate the Flemish vote, echoing a broader trend observed across Europe during this electoral cycle, where far-right parties have increasingly garnered support <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>. Such trends signal potential changes in governance, as parties may need to engage in complex coalition-building to secure majorities amid a fragmented political environment.\n\nThe federal elections will not only influence national policy but also affect Belgium's intricate system of federalism, where regional and linguistic divisions often complicate governance. The results will dictate the formation of various coalitions, both at the federal level and within the regions, leading to potential shifts in Belgium's political direction and the fate of ongoing crises such as migration, economic recovery post-COVID, and integration within the European Union <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n\nUnderstanding the landscape ahead of the elections requires an examination of the motivations of the electorate, the manifestos of competing parties, and the possible implications of electoral outcomes. As voter preferences evolve, the significance of these elections cannot be understated, making them a key focus for both national and international observers alike <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation>.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to take place on June 9, marking a pivotal moment in the country's political landscape as it navigates the post-pandemic recovery. This election, characterized by a significant rise in populism, notably from right-leaning parties, reflects a broader trend observed across Europe. The elections will not only determine the composition of the federal government but will also impact local governance and Belgium's role within the European Union.\n\nVoter turnout is expected to be a critical issue, as early polls suggest one of the lowest participation rates in history for a compulsory voting country. This marks a departure from the norm since compulsory voting was introduced in Belgium over a century ago. The implications of such low engagement could reverberate throughout the nation's political future, risking the validity of the newly formed government.\n\nWith approximately 6,550 candidates set to contest for various positions, including those in the federal parliament, regional assemblies, and the European Parliament, the election will provide a diverse slate for Belgian citizens to choose from. The political discourse leading up to the elections has been heavily influenced by pressing issues such as immigration, economic reform, and national identity, largely driven by polarizing parties, notably the far-right Vlaams Belang and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) in Flanders.\n\nThe results of the elections will be crucial not just for immediate governance but for the formation of coalitions, which have historically been complex and lengthy in Belgium. The electorate will be keenly watching to see how the balance of power shifts and what this means for the country's socio-economic policies and its strategic direction within the EU. As voters head to the polls, the outcomes will undoubtedly shape the narrative of Belgian politics for years to come.\n\nOverall, the 2024 Belgian federal elections serve as a significant barometer of public sentiment, showcasing the challenges and opportunities facing contemporary Belgium amid a rapidly changing political climate and the broader socio-economic context.<citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation><citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation><citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-whats-at-stake-for-the-belgian-people</citation>\n## Retiring Incumbents\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections saw notable shifts in the political landscape, highlighted by significant retirements among incumbents. One key figure stepping back from active politics is Guy Verhofstadt, a prominent member of the Open VLD party and a former Prime Minister of Belgium. Verhofstadt, who has served in various capacities since his election to the Belgian Parliament in 1985, has announced that he will not seek re-election in 2024, marking the end of an era for one of Belgium’s most recognizable political figures <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/494091/former-belgian-pm-guy-verhofstadt-to-retire-from-politics-in-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the 2024 elections were characterized by a growing trend of political fatigue and disillusionment among Belgian politicians, contributing to a wave of retirements from various parties. Many incumbents expressed their desire to leave politics due to burnout and a perception of diminished efficacy in the current political system <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/823083/fatigue-burn-out-disgust-why-belgian-mps-are-leaving-politics</citation>. This phenomenon underscores the broader challenges facing Belgian governance, particularly amidst coalition negotiations and the fragmented nature of the political environment, which has seen increasing polarization among the electorate.\n\nThe departure of established politicians like Verhofstadt indicates a potential shift in party dynamics, as new candidates will likely emerge to fill these positions. The landscape following this election could witness a reconfiguration of alliances and the introduction of fresh policies reflective of the changing priorities of the Belgian populace.\n\nOverall, the retirements of key incumbents during this election cycle highlight critical factors influencing Belgium's political arena, including individual burnout, shifting public sentiments, and the need for renewal in political representation.\n### Senate\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, were significant for both the political landscape and the structure of the Senate. The Senate, comprising 60 members, includes 50 senators indirectly elected by regional and language community parliaments, along with 10 co-opted senators selected based on party performance in federal elections. The outcome of the elections resulted in a notable shift, positioning the Flemish nationalist party, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), as the largest faction in the Senate with ten senators, reflecting an increasing trend toward right-wing politics in Belgium <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>.\n\nIn the context of the broader elections, the N-VA's prominence indicates a political realignment in Flanders, where it secured approximately 24% of the vote, closely followed by the radical right party Vlaams Belang <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The rise of these right-wing parties reflects an electorate that is increasingly polarized, particularly on issues surrounding migration and regional autonomy.\n\nFrom a structural perspective, there is an ongoing discussion about the future of the Senate itself, with coalitions expressing intentions to abolish this chamber altogether. Such a move would necessitate a two-thirds majority vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, signifying the complexities involved in potential constitutional reforms <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2025/05/15/abolition-senate/</citation>.\n\nRegardless of whether the Senate persists, the results of the 2024 elections have paved the way for significant political transformations. Voter turnout was lower than usual, the lowest since compulsory voting was introduced, suggesting voter disengagement and discontent with the current political climate <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The outcomes signal a demand for change, particularly in coalition structures, as the incumbent government's majority faces challenges from these rising parties. Future discussions and legislative actions will likely focus on the viability of the Senate and the impact of these political shifts on Belgium's federal governance <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n## Electoral System\n\nThe electoral system in Belgium is characterized by a proportional representation model, specifically using a party-list system. This system allows voters to cast their votes for political parties rather than individual candidates, which subsequently allocates seats in the Chamber of Representatives based on the percentage of votes each party receives in a given electoral district. Each district is assigned a number of seats correlating to its population size, thereby ensuring that representation reflects the demographic distribution across the country <citation>https://electiopedia.com/elections-in-belgium/</citation>.\n\nBelgium’s system underwent significant changes after the sixth state reform in December 2011, which granted more powers to regional governments and led to a more complex electoral landscape <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>. Federal elections occur every five years, synchronizing with European and regional elections to streamline the voting process for citizens <citation>https://www.populationencyclopedia.com/belgium-elections/overview/</citation>.\n\nOne notable feature of the Belgian electoral system is the requirement for compulsory voting, which mandates that all eligible citizens aged 18 and over participate in elections, a measure that aims to enhance voter turnout <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>. In recent developments, legislation has also been introduced allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in European elections, marking a progressive step in youth participation in the democratic process <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>.\n\nThe ballots used in these elections include a list of candidates from the respective parties, with voters able to select candidates from their chosen parties. This system not only enhances voter choice but also reinforces party accountability as parties strive to appeal to their constituents to secure votes at the next election <citation>https://www.reuters.com/article/world/factbox-key-facts-about-belgiums-electoral-system-idUSL10246183</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the electoral system of Belgium is designed to promote proportionality and voter engagement while ensuring that various socio-political voices are represented in the federal government. The combination of a party-list system, compulsory voting, and recent reforms targeting youth voters signifies Belgium's commitment to a robust democratic process <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BE/BE-LC01/elections/electoral-system</citation>.\n## Aftermath\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, marked a significant transition in the nation’s political landscape. The elections resulted in a notable shift to the right, reflecting a growing dissatisfaction among voters with the traditional political parties. The New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) emerged as the largest party, reinforcing its position in the Belgian Parliament, while the far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) also saw substantial electoral gains, leading to speculation about potential coalitions and shifts in governance <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-far-right-election-extremist-landslide-elections-in-europe-results-2024/</citation>.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, King Philippe began consultations with party leaders to form a new government. Political analysts noted that possible coalitions could either revive the previous “Vivaldi” coalition or lean towards a center-right alliance, especially among liberal and nationalist parties. The election outcomes suggested a fragmentation of the political scene, with parties like the Francophone reformist Movement (MR) and the Socialists (PS) experiencing variable fortunes <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1087277/election-aftermath-kingmakers-deal-breakers-and-will-flanders-break-with-belgium</citation>.\n\nThe low turnout of 87.4%, the lowest since compulsory voting was introduced, raised concerns about voter engagement and the implications of this trend on future elections. Many observers expressed shock and discontent at the election results, interpreting them as a cautionary signal regarding the growing extremism in Belgian politics, particularly in the traditionally left-leaning regions like Wallonia <citation>https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/16/in-belgium-stupefaction-after-federal-parliamentary-elections_6674912_4.html</citation>.\n\nDespite the rightward drift, some analysts argued that the expected extreme shift did not materialize as anticipated. While the results indicated a preference for more conservative governance, the far-right did not dominate as heavily as polls had predicted. This cautious outcome could be seen as a potential buffer against radical political changes, yet it underscores the rising tensions within Belgian society regarding issues such as immigration and regional autonomy <citation>https://www.newlinesmag.com/argument/how-belgium-elected-a-far-right-government/</citation>.\n\nWith a new political order set to emerge, the upcoming coalition negotiations will be pivotal. The dynamics within these discussions will likely determine Belgium's approach to key domestic issues and its stance within the European Union as it navigates the complexities of governance in a multi-party system <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.",
