You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.\n\n## Tool Use Formatting\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Execute safe mathematical expressions.\\n\\nSupports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **) and common mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc.).\\nFor security reasons, only mathematical expressions are allowed, no arbitrary code execution.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Mathematical expression to calculate, e.g., \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\", \\\"sin(30 * pi / 180)\\\", \\\"sqrt(16)\\\"\"}}, \"required\": [\"expression\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n"

In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix.

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: The Belgian elections' biggest winners... and losers - The Brussels Times\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers\\nCONTENT: The Brussels Parliament saw a major shift as for the first time in 15 years the French-speaking liberal MR became the biggest French-speaking party in the Captial Region.

De Croo handed over his resignation as prime minister to the country’s King Philippe, a procedural step after which the king meets with leaders of Belgium’s biggest parties: N-VA’s De Wever first, Vlaams Belang’s Tom Van Grieken second and MR’s Bouchez third.

In light of these results, the most obvious partners to enter formation talks were N-VA, CD&V, Vooruit, MR and Les Engagés, which ideologically are not too disparate and crucially, can together muster a governing majority. On the French-speaking side, a majority was found quite quickly: winners MR immediately decided to work with Les Engagés, while socialist PS joined at the start of August. Due to the PS's electoral loss, and the wins by MR and Les Engagés, the new Walloon Government and the new French Community Government were both already formed on 11 July (which, ironically, is the Flemish holiday).\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Belgium's federal parliamentary elections cause shock among population\\nURL: https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/16/in-belgium-stupefaction-after-federal-parliamentary-elections_6674912_4.html\\nCONTENT: Opinion Subscribers only'Trump is playing his hand impulsively, while Xi Jinping is far more methodical' Opinion Subscribers only'We call on the European Union to endorse a confederation of the states of Israel and Palestine in one homeland' Opinion Subscribers onlyIn 1945, French women 'voted for the right to vote by massively turning out for their first elections' Editorial Ukraine: A crucial week Vous pouvez lire Le Monde sur un seul appareil à la fois Parce qu’une autre personne (ou vous) est en train de lire Le Monde avec ce compte sur un autre appareil.

When asked about the reasons behind the Workers' Party's breakthrough in the kingdom's French-speaking community since the previous general elections on 26 May 2019, Emilie van Haute, professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels, explains: \\\"The nature of the public debate is quite different: in Flanders, it is much more focused on migration issues, which is very favourable to Vlaams Belang, the party that has made these issues its main campaign theme.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Belgium: the 2024 federal elections - deadlock ahead?\\nURL: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/\\nCONTENT: Since October 2020, Belgium has been governed by a coalition of seven parties (the so-called “Vivaldi” coalition) – excluding the two largest parties in Flanders, the N-VA and VB – with Alexander De Croo, leading figure of the Open Vld, as prime minister. Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament. Another coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: POLITICO Poll of Polls — Belgian polls, trends and election news for ...\\nURL: https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/belgium/\\nCONTENT: POLITICO Poll of Polls — Belgian polls, trends and election news for Belgium – POLITICO *   Brussels Playbook *   EU Election Playbook *   POLITICO Confidential *   POLITICO 28 Elections in Europe Politico Live EU EP affiliation: PfE EP affiliation: ECR EP affiliation: RE EP affiliation: Greens/EFA Christian Democratic and Flemish EP affiliation: EPP Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats EP affiliation: RE EP affiliation: Greens/EFA EP affiliation: RE Belgium — European election 2024 results updated 10 months ago Check European election 2024 results for all EU countries.

A notable trend was the success of centre-right parties, particularly the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), which emerged as a dominant force in both regions <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nIn Wallonia, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) achieved a significant victory. The results indicated a clear win for right and centre-right parties, with MR securing 26 seats and Les Engagés (formerly CDH) obtaining 17 seats in the Walloon Parliament. This outcome enabled these two parties to quickly form a centre-right coalition government in the region <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>. The new Walloon Government, along with the French Community Government (also led by an MR-Les Engagés coalition), was formed by July 11, 2024, signaling a relatively swift transition driven by the electoral success of MR and Les Engagés and the electoral setback for the Socialist Party (PS) <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>. The MR party president, Georges-Louis Bouchez, interpreted the election results as a public desire for \"change and reform\" <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels-Capital Region:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region also witnessed a major political realignment among its French-speaking electorate. For the first time in 15 years, MR became the largest French-speaking party in the region. They secured just under 26% of the vote among French-speaking parties in Brussels, a significant increase from their 2019 score of 16.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>. Voters in Brussels have the unique option to vote for either French-speaking or Dutch-speaking party lists, with the French-speaking college being considerably larger, which is reflected in the seat distribution <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/EZ_eupinions_Belgium_the_War_and_the_Vote_02.2024.pdf</citation>. While MR saw overall success, local results varied; for instance, in the Anderlecht municipality of Brussels, the Belgian Worker's Party (PTB/PVDA) emerged as the most popular party, followed by the PS and then MR <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\n**Key French-speaking Parties and Dynamics:**\nSeveral parties play significant roles in the French-speaking political landscape:\n*   **Mouvement Réformateur (MR):** (Liberals) Emerged as the main victor in both Wallonia and Brussels, leading the new Walloon government with Les Engagés <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation> <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n*   **Parti Socialiste (PS):** (Social Democrats) Traditionally a dominant force, the PS experienced an electoral decline but remains a significant player, particularly at the local level in Brussels <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n*   **Les Engagés:** (Christian Democrats, formerly CDH) Partnered with MR to form the government in Wallonia and the French Community, marking a successful election for the rebranded party <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>.\n*   **Parti du Travail de Belgique (PTB/PVDA):** (Radical Left) This party, the only significant national party in Belgium, continued its breakthrough in the French-speaking community, showing strong performance in certain urban areas like Anderlecht <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160-with-the-radical-right-pushing-ahead-in-flanders-and-the-radical-left-in-wallonia-belgium-could-be-divided-after-the-elections</citation>.\n*   **Ecolo:** (Greens) Another key party in the French-speaking sphere <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n*   **DéFI (Démocrate Fédéraliste Indépendant):** A centrist party with a primary focus on Brussels <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-the-key-players-in-defi</citation> <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe election outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies indicated a shift towards the centre-right and a desire for political change, leading to new governing coalitions in Wallonia and a reshaped political hierarchy in Brussels.\n</answer>"

Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament. Another coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Belgium braces for Sunday's electoral showdown with final opinion polls\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls\\nCONTENT: In voting intentions among Belgians for the federal elections, the same dynamic plays out.

In Flanders, Flemish nationalists Vlaams Belang and N-VA (far-right and right-wing respectively) are the two leading parties, while in Wallonia, Paul Magnette’s socialists break away from George Louis Bouchez’s MR. Among the political families at the Belgian level, the francophone Socialist Party (PS) and Vouruit in Flanders – both part of the S&D group in the European Parliament – have the largest seat projection at the national level with 32.

Credit: Hatim Kaghat / Belga\\nThe latest poll conducted, by a consortium of Belgian media organisations, Het Laatste Nieuws, Le Soir, RTL TVi and VTM, has outlined the political preferences of Belgian voters ahead of the 2024 Federal Elections.\\nThe results confirmed previous ideas of Belgian politics: a predominantly left-leaning Wallonia, a centre-left leaning in Brussels and a strong right-wing in Flanders, geared towards independence.\\nRegionally, the francophone liberal party MR is leading in Brussels, closely courted by the Belgian Workers’ Party (PTB). In Flanders, Flemish nationalists Vlaams Belang and N-VA (far-right and right-wing respectively) are the two leading parties, while in Wallonia, Paul Magnette’s socialists break away from George Louis Bouchez’s MR.\\nIn terms of popularity, three liberal politicians come out on top: Alexander De Croo, Sophie Wilmès, and Hadja Lahbib.\\nBelgium\\nAmong the political families at the Belgian level, the francophone Socialist Party (PS) and Vouruit in Flanders – both part of the S&D group in the European Parliament – have the largest seat projection at the national level with 32.\\nTied at 24 seats are Vlaams Belang – an indication of its dominance in Flanders – and the liberal political family, MR and Open VLD (Renew in the European Parliament), with the latter being up two.\\nN-VA is in fourth with 20 seats, but like Vlaams Belang, only Flemish people are able to vote for them, meaning they are propelled into parliament thanks to huge support in the Flemish region. The Belgian worker party (PTB-PDVA) is stable at 18 seats. The Belgian Green Parties (Ecolo and Groen) have lost one seat, down to 15.\\nHowever, with 81 seats, the current Federal Government (PS, MR, Ecolo, Groen, CD&V, Open VLD, Vooruit) retains the majority in the Federal Parliament, according to projections. The result of 81 seats is better (by one) than the previous survey carried out last December, but still well below the 87 seats obtained in the May 2019 parliamentary elections.\\nBrussels\\nFrancophone liberals MR lead across the Brussels-Capital Region with 20%, closely tailed by a significant rise of the Belgian Workers Party (PTB)–  who are up 3% to 19%, and are ahead of the Socialist Party (PS) and francophone greens, Ecolo.\\nMR, which polled 19.8% of voting intentions, is first in the ranking but is down 0.5% from the survey of last December, but still 2.3% better than in the 2019 elections.\\nBehind them, the PTB is making up the ground at a substantial pace, jumping from 12.3% of the vote in the 2019 elections to 19.4% of voting intentions today, and is only 0.4% behind leaders MR.\\nIn third place, the Socialist Party (PS) continues to drop heavily. In the latest poll, PS counted 16.8% of voting intentions, compared to 20% of the vote in 2019, and 21.6% of voting intentions in the December 2022 poll.\\nFourth with 15.7%, the francophone greens, Ecolo, slightly improved their result from the previous poll in December, where it received 13%, but is doing worse than in the 2019 elections, where it won 21.6% of the vote.\\nStable, centrists Défi polled 10.2% of voting intentions, while conservatives Les Engagés are down to 5.1% of voting intentions, compared to 5.8% of the vote in 2019.\\nWallonia\\nIn the southern region of the country, the gap is widening between socialists and liberals. The Socialist Party (PS) continues to go from strength to strength under leader Paul Magnette, who is also the Mayor of Charleroi.\\nIn first, PS polled a comfortable 26%, while the gap with second-placed MR (19%) led by George Louis Bouchez, has widened by 7% – the largest between the two main political formations in Wallonia since the beginning of the legislature. The Belgian Workers Party (PTB) is in third with 18%, and the Greens (Ecolo) with 13%.\\nThere is also less than one percentage point difference between MR and PTB, the third largest party in terms of voting intentions. In the past, PTB has already achieved better results in the survey, but like Ecolo, they are stable. The former at 17.6% this time and the latter at 12.8%, scores that have changed little since December 2022.\\nA significant breakthrough is finally to be found on the side of the Engagés, which finally regains some colour with 11.1% of voting intentions.\\nFlanders\\nIn Flanders, aside from the seemingly unsurmountable rise of nationalist right-wing independentism, the party of Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has sunk to its lowest results ever recorded for the party in Flanders: 9%.\\nFar-right party Vlaams Belang is still leading the polls in the Flemish region, with 25% expressing a preference for the separatists and nationalists.\\nIn second place, another Flemish independence party, N-VA remains stable at 22% – with leader and Antwerp Mayor Bart De Wever’s recent anti-woke push seemingly not having made as much of a splash as was maybe hoped.\\n\\n345 top jobs in Belgium\\nFinance ManagerHealth Care Without Harm EuropeSenior Business Controller, Mechatronics and Sustainable PackagingAmazonTreasury ManagerSWIFTVibrations Project EngineerLaborelecFinance and Administration Officer (French-speaking)Health Care Without Harm Europe\\nSee all jobs Post a job\\nLatest News\\n\\nLIVE General strike day: Cancelled flights, only one metro running in Brussels\\n\\n'They helped people in need': Criminal charges for helping migrants on the rise\\n\\nBrussels Public Prosecutors to strike - will prioritise government corruption\\n\\nAmnesty International sends 'strongest warning ever' on Trump day 100\\n\\nMichelin Guide 2025: First star awarded to 11 Belgian restaurants\\n\\n'Move fast and break things': Trump's first 100 days as US President\\n\\nUkraine's allies will step up pressure on Russia, says Macron\\n\\nTrade union front calls for an effective extension of the social energy tariff\\n\\nEuropean rearmament boosts Rheinmetall's sales\\n\\nBelgium will keep Congo on the international agenda, Prévot assures Tshisekedi\\n\\nNorenca recalls its turkey kebabs due to possible salmonella contamination\\n\\nTwo on trial for allegedly cutting down 'Robin Hood' tree\\n\\nRecord number of disruption accidents on Flemish motorways in 2024\\n\\nHighest increase in global military spending since 1991\\nLoad more\\nCopyright © 2025 The Brussels Times.

Philippe Mongrain and Karolin Soontjens preview the vote, writing that while it is difficult to predict the outcome, the tide seems to have turned in favour of more radical parties.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article is part of a series on the 2024 European Parliament elections. The EUROPP blog will also be co-hosting a panel discussion on the elections at LSE on 6 June.\\n\\nOn 9 June, Belgians will head to the polls for the first time in five years, making this the longest period without any parliamentary elections since the Second World War. Voters will cast their ballots for members of the regional, federal and European parliaments.\\n\\nDuring the last federal elections in 2019, we witnessed a weakening of the ruling parties (N-VA, MR, Open Vld, CD&V) and, more generally, of traditional party families. Liberals (Open Vld, MR), Social Democrats (SP.A/Vooruit, PS) and Christian Democrats (CD&V, cdH/LE) gathered less than 50 percent of the vote, a first since the Second Word War (see Figure 1).\\n\\nThe decline of these party factions primarily benefited more radical alternatives on both sides of the ideological spectrum. Vlaams Belang (VB), a Flemish nationalist and right-wing populist party that advocates for the independence of Flanders and stricter immigration policies, managed to significantly increase its presence in parliament, gaining 18 seats in 2019 compared to just three in 2014.\\n\\nOn the far left, the communist Workers’ Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB) gained 12 seats, up from only two in 2014. It appears that Vlaams Belang was able to attract mostly previous N-VA supporters – despite the latter’s efforts to prevent voters from shifting to the far right by adopting a tougher stance on immigration. Meanwhile, the PVDA-PTB mostly appealed to former SP.A (now Vooruit) and Groen supporters in Flanders, as well as Socialist (PS) voters in Wallonia and Brussels.\\n\\nFigure 1: Results of the 2014 and 2019 Belgian federal elections\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Data from IBZ – SPF Intérieur. Semi-transparent bars show 2014 results. Solid bars show 2019 results. DéFI was formerly known as FDF, Les Engagés (LE) as cdH, and Vooruit as sp.a.\\n\\nThe outcome of the 2019 federal elections further exacerbated the divergence between an already more right-leaning Flanders and more left-leaning Wallonia. The election results largely mirrored the policy priorities in each region, with immigration being higher on the public agenda in Flanders, while socioeconomic issues were the top issues among Walloon voters. Moreover, the growth of extreme parties and the refusal of mainstream parties to govern with the far right (as part of the “cordon sanitaire”) have significantly complicated the government formation process.\\n\\nFollowing the collapse of the Michel government in December 2018 due to the N-VA’s opposition to the Global Compact for Migration, the country went through 652 days of temporary arrangements and caretaker governments. Since October 2020, Belgium has been governed by a coalition of seven parties (the so-called “Vivaldi” coalition) – excluding the two largest parties in Flanders, the N-VA and VB – with Alexander De Croo, leading figure of the Open Vld, as prime minister.\\n\\nMost polls conducted after the 2019 elections have shown Vlaams Belang ahead of the N-VA by a few points in terms of vote intentions (see Figure 2). This marks an important shift from the 2014–2019 election cycle during which the N-VA was by far the largest party. Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament.\\n\\nFigure 2: Voting intention and seat projections for the Belgian federal elections (May 2014 – March 2024)\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Data from Wikipedia. Semi-transparent markers represent individual polls. Trend lines are local regressions (losses). Diamond-framed markers show the actual vote share/number of seats won by each party on election day.\\n\\nThe three Flemish centre-right formations (CD&V, N-VA and Open Vld) as well as the Greens are experiencing a (large) decline in support compared to the previous elections. This expected loss of support is greatest for the prime minister’s party (Open Vld), for which the polls predict an historically low result of around eight percent.\\n\\nFor a long time, the polls were much more positive for the centre-left party Vooruit, which was polling at over 16 percent last year. Recently, though, the polls report much lower support, following controversies surrounding its former chairman, Conner Rousseau, who resigned over racist remarks in November 2023. Vooruit now finds itself almost neck-and-neck with the CD&V at approximately 11 percent.\\n\\nHowever, Rousseau has recently announced his comeback and will be actively involved in the campaign, hoping to reverse the recent negative trend in the polls. While the progression of the Flemish socialists has been halted, the PVDA appears to be gaining new supporters in Flanders: around 10 percent of Flemish voters say they intend to vote for the PVDA, twice its score in the previous federal election. In fact, communists are making headway in all three regions, with support for the PVDA-PTB hovering around 16-18 percent in Wallonia and Brussels.\\n\\nThe Socialist Party (PS) continues to lead vote intention polls in Wallonia, closely followed by the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR), which currently holds the top position in Brussels. The centrist Les Engagés (LE) is also improving its score among voters in both Wallonia and Brussels, while Ecolo appears to be losing support in both regions.\\n\\nGovernment formation\\n\\nThese polls hint at a complicated government formation process, mainly because the rise of extreme parties (PVDA-PTB and Vlaams Belang) makes it challenging to form governments with a limited number of mainstream parties. All parties explicitly refute the possibility of forming a government with Vlaams Belang – except for some N-VA politicians who have declared their willingness to break the cordon sanitaire. In addition, most parties have stated they would refuse any coalition agreement with the PVDA-PTB.\\n\\nIn most polls, the current federal Vivaldi coalition maintains a majority, albeit only in Brussels and Wallonia. Hence, Vivaldi II might be possible, but the dynamics between the current Vivaldi parties would shift substantially, with Open Vld taking a much weaker position and vice versa for the socialist parties.\\n\\nAnother coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too. However, the enthusiasm for such a large coalition seems low.\\n\\nAn alternative possibility is forming a federal minority cabinet. The N-VA for instance has advocated for such a minority government with the socialists – possibly securing around 55-60 seats. However, it is hard to see why socialists, especially the PS in Wallonia which is losing voters to the PTB, would be in favour of such a set-up. The PS would rather lean towards a left-wing government including socialists, greens, communists and Christian Democrats. This kind of federal coalition would have a substantial majority in Brussels and Wallonia, but not in Flanders. Plus, it is highly uncertain whether the Christian Democrats are willing to govern with the communists in the first place.\\n\\nWith over a month remaining before Belgians head to the polls, one can only be cautious about making electoral forecasts. Nonetheless, it seems relatively safe to say that, over the past years, the tide seems to have turned in favour of more radical parties, mirroring recent trends in other European countries and leaving traditional mainstream parties in decline. This is particularly true for Vlaams Belang, which can look at the recent success of the Dutch far-right PVV party in 2023 as a rather good omen.\\n\\nNote: This article gives the views of the authors, not the position of EUROPP – European Politics and Policy or the London School of Economics.

A key observation was the continued weakening of traditional mainstream parties and the corresponding rise in support for parties on the far-right and far-left of the political spectrum <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. Polling data was regularly published by firms such as Ipsos, Kantar, iVox, and De Stemming, and aggregated by platforms like PolitPro and Politico <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024, https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/belgium/</citation>.\n\n**Overall National Trends:**\nPolls consistently showed a political landscape deeply divided along regional and ideological lines. The divergence between a more right-leaning Flanders and a more left-leaning Wallonia remained a defining characteristic <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. The growth of the far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) and the far-left Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB) complicated predictions for government formation, with most established parties hesitant to form coalitions with these extremes <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Flanders:**\nIn Flanders, the far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) consistently polled as one of the largest, if not the largest, party. An Ipsos poll from early June 2024, for instance, placed VB at 25.8% and the Flemish nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) at 21% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. The Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V) party was polling around 12.3% in the same poll. The socialist party Vooruit, after a period of growth, stabilized around 15.6% following controversies surrounding its former chairman <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024, https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. Conversely, the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open Vld), the party of then Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, faced historically low polling numbers, around 7% in early June 2024 <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. The Flemish Greens (Groen) were polling around 6.1%, while the Workers' Party (PVDA) showed notable gains, reaching around 10.2% in Flanders <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024, https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nIn Wallonia, the Socialist Party (PS) generally led the polls, though the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) often ran a close second or even matched them. An Ipsos poll from late May 2024, for example, showed both PS and MR at 22.6% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. The Workers' Party (PTB) also demonstrated strong support, polling around 14.5% in the same poll, and other polls showed them even higher at times <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024, https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. The centrist party Les Engagés (formerly cdH) showed signs of recovery, polling at 18.1% in late May 2024, while the green party Ecolo polled around 8.8% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**Brussels:**\nThe political situation in the Brussels-Capital Region was also competitive. The Mouvement Réformateur (MR) was frequently reported as the leading party. Final opinion polls conducted in late May 2024 (May 29-31) indicated MR maintaining a lead with 22.9% of voting intentions, followed by PTB at 19.8% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. This was consistent with earlier polls in 2023 and 2024 which also showed MR in a strong position, with PTB, PS, and Ecolo as other major contenders <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections, https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. For example, an April 2023 poll had shown MR at 20%, PTB at 19%, PS at 16.8%, and Ecolo at 15.7% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>.\n\n**Final Polls and Implications:**\nThe final polls leading up to the June 9 election largely reinforced these established trends. The predicted rise of parties at the extremes of the political spectrum, particularly Vlaams Belang in Flanders and PTB-PVDA across regions, alongside the varied performance of traditional parties, pointed towards a complex process of government formation at the federal level, potentially leading to prolonged negotiations <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/, https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>.\n</answer>"

This trend suggested a potentially complicated government formation process post-election <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. Polls consistently highlighted distinct voting patterns across Belgium's three regions: Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels.\n\n**Overall National Trends**\n\nNationally, polls indicated a significant surge for the far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) and the far-left Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB). Vlaams Belang was consistently polled as the largest or second-largest party in Flanders, often ahead of the nationalist N-VA. The PVDA-PTB showed growing support not only in its traditional Walloon base but also in Flanders and Brussels <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. Conversely, parties like Open Vld, the party of then Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, were predicted to suffer significant losses, with polls indicating historically low results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. A final opinion poll conducted between 29-31 May 2024 for federal voting intentions highlighted these dynamics, particularly in Francophone Belgium, showing the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) with a strong lead at 22.9%, closely followed by a surging Parti du Travail de Belgique (PTB) at 19.8% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>.\n\n**Polling in Flanders**\n\nIn Flanders, opinion polls in the final weeks before the election consistently showed the far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) vying for the top spot. An Ipsos poll published around June 4, 2024, placed VB at 25.8%, ahead of the Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie (N-VA) at 21%. The socialist party Vooruit was polled at 15.6%, followed by Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams (CD&V) at 12.3%. The Partij van de Arbeid (PVDA) was projected to get 10.2%. The liberal Open Vld, party of the Prime Minister, was polling at a low 7%, with Groen (Greens) at 6.1% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. This confirmed a significant trend of VB solidifying its position as a leading force in the region and a notable decline for Open Vld <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Polling in Wallonia**\n\nIn Wallonia, the political landscape appeared to be a tighter race between the traditional Parti Socialiste (PS) and the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR). An Ipsos poll from May 20, 2024, showed both PS and MR neck-and-neck at 22.6% of voting intentions. Les Engagés (formerly cdH) showed a notable rise, polling at 18.1%. The Parti du Travail de Belgique (PTB) was at 14.5%, while Ecolo (Greens) was projected at 8.8% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. However, the final poll from late May indicated a strong performance for MR at 22.9% and a significant rise for PTB to 19.8% in federal voting intentions, suggesting MR might have pulled ahead of PS closer to the election, with PTB becoming a very strong third force in Francophone Belgium <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. Earlier analyses also pointed to PS leading, closely followed by MR <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Polling in Brussels**\n\nIn the Brussels-Capital Region, the francophone liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) was consistently polled as the leading party <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>. Polls also indicated a significant rise for the PTB in the capital. For instance, an April 2023 poll showed MR leading with 20%, closely followed by PTB at 19% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>. The late May 2024 federal intentions poll showing MR at 22.9% and PTB at 19.8% for Francophone voters would also reflect their strong positions in Brussels <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The Socialist Party (PS) and Ecolo were generally polled behind these two, with Ecolo, in particular, showing signs of losing support compared to previous elections <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. Detailed final polls for Brussels specifically by PolitPro showed varying figures, but the overarching trend pointed to a strong MR and a rising PTB.\n</answer>"

Several polling organizations, including Ipsos, Kantar, and iVox, conducted surveys, with results often aggregated and analyzed by media outlets and platforms like PolitPro and POLITICO.\n\n**Overall National Trends**\n\nPolls consistently indicated a challenging environment for some traditional mainstream parties, with notable gains for parties on the far-right and far-left of the political spectrum <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. The Flemish nationalist and far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) was frequently polled as potentially the largest party in Flanders and, consequently, a major force at the federal level. The Workers' Party of Belgium (PTB/PVDA) also showed continued growth across all regions. Projections based on polls leading up to March 2024 suggested Vlaams Belang could secure around 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\nThe final opinion polls conducted between May 29-31, 2024, just before the election, suggested that in federal voting intentions, the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) was holding a lead at 22.9%, closely followed by the PTB at 19.8%. This represented a significant increase for PTB compared to their 2019 results <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>.\n\n**Regional Breakdowns**\n\n*   **Flanders:** In the northern region of Flanders, polls consistently showed a battle for dominance between the far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) and the Flemish nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA).\n    *   An Ipsos poll released around June 4, 2024, placed VB at 25.8%, N-VA at 21%, the socialist Vooruit at 15.6%, the Christian Democrats (CD&V) at 12.3%, the Workers' Party (PVDA) at 10.2%, the liberal Open Vld (party of the then Prime Minister) at 7%, and the Greens (Groen) at 6.1% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n    *   Earlier polls in May 2024 from Ipsos and iVox showed similar trends, with VB generally polling between 25-27% and N-VA around 20-22% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Open Vld consistently polled at historically low levels <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. Vooruit saw a period of growth but faced challenges later, while PVDA showed an upward trend <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n*   **Wallonia:** In the southern French-speaking region of Wallonia, the Socialist Party (PS) and the liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) were the main competitors.\n    *   An Ipsos poll from May 20, 2024, indicated a tight race, with both PS and MR at 22.6%. They were followed by the centrist Les Engagés (LE) at 18.1%, and the Workers' Party (PTB) at 14.5% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. The Greens (Ecolo) were polling lower than in previous elections. The aforementioned final federal poll snippet also highlighted MR's strength and PTB's significant rise in French-speaking Belgium <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>.\n\n*   **Brussels:** The Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual, presented a multi-polar political landscape.\n    *   Polls suggested a competitive environment. An Ipsos poll from March 18, 2024, showed MR leading with 21.8%, followed by PTB/PVDA at 17.5%, PS at 15.4%, Ecolo at 14.7%, and DéFI (Democratic Federalist Independent) at 8.8% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n    *   A Brussels Times report from April 2023 also highlighted MR leading with 20%, closely followed by PTB at 19% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>. Some May 2024 polls on PolitPro showed MR with a strong lead (potentially 23.3% if a listed party was a misattribution), followed by PTB/PVDA (19.8%), PS (15.2%), and Ecolo (12.5%) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**Seat Projections and Coalition Outlook**\n\nBased on polling data from early to mid-2024, forming a federal government was expected to be complex. While the incumbent seven-party \"Vivaldi\" coalition (composed of socialists, liberals, greens, and CD&V) was often projected to retain a narrow majority (around 81 seats in an April 2023 projection <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>), the internal balance of power was expected to shift significantly, with liberal parties like Open Vld potentially weakening and socialist parties, alongside PTB/PVDA, gaining ground <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. Alternative coalitions, such as a \"Burgundian\" coalition (N-VA, liberals, socialists, and potentially Christian Democrats), also appeared sporadically as arithmetically possible in some polls <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that opinion polls offer a snapshot of voter intentions at a particular time and are not definitive predictors of election outcomes. Belgian electoral history has instances where final results have diverged from pre-election polling <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>."

The June 4th poll had Vooruit (VO) at 15.6% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The Christian Democrats (CD&V) were polling around 12.3% in early June 2024 <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PVDA) showed significant gains in Flanders, polling at 10.2% in early June 2024, nearly double its 2019 score <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Open Vld (OVLD), the Flemish liberal party of the Prime Minister, polled at 7%, a significant drop <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Groen (Flemish Greens) were at 6.1% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nWallonia, the French-speaking southern region, generally leaned more to the left.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) traditionally led in Wallonia. An Ipsos poll from May 20, 2024, showed PS at 22.6%, neck-and-neck with MR <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. An earlier Kantar poll from April 18, 2024, had PS leading more clearly at 25.4% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) was the second major force, polling at 22.6% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB, the francophone wing of PVDA) also showed strong support, polling at 14.5% (Ipsos, May 20) to 16% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Les Engagés (LE, formerly cdH, centrist) showed improvement, polling at 18.1% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Ecolo (Francophone Greens) were polling around 8.8% (Ipsos, May 20) to 12.7% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>, indicating a loss of support compared to previous elections <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual but largely French-speaking, presented a distinct political dynamic.\n*   Final opinion polls conducted between May 29-31, 2024, indicated that for federal voting intentions, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) held a \"healthy lead\" at 22.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. This was also reflected in earlier 2024 polls, such as an Ipsos poll from March 18, 2024, which placed MR at 21.8% in Brussels <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) was reported as \"tailing\" MR in the final May polls at 19.8%, representing a significant increase from their 2019 federal election result <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The March 18 Ipsos poll showed PVDA at 17.5% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) polled at 15.4% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Some later polls from PolitPro showed varying figures, with one May 20 Ipsos poll indicating Open VLD surprisingly high, which seemed to be an outlier compared to other data and analyses <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Ecolo, the francophone Greens, polled at 14.7% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**National Outlook and Seat Projections**\nWhile specific nationwide seat projections varied between pollsters, the LSE Europp blog in April 2024 noted that Vlaams Belang's projected support in Flanders could translate to approximately 25 seats in the 150-seat federal Chamber of Representatives, potentially making it the largest single party in parliament <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. An April 2023 poll analysis by The Brussels Times suggested that the then-current seven-party \"Vivaldi\" federal government coalition (PS, MR, Ecolo, Groen, CD&V, Open VLD, Vooruit) was projected to retain a slim majority of 81 seats, down from 87 in 2019 <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>. However, the declining fortunes of parties like Open Vld suggested that even if a similar coalition were mathematically possible, the internal dynamics would shift significantly <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\nThe rise of extremist parties (PVDA-PTB and Vlaams Belang), with whom most mainstream parties refused to govern (the \"cordon sanitaire\" against Vlaams Belang being a key factor), pointed towards another potentially lengthy and complicated government formation process <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n</answer>"

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件,要求详细全面\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election marked a significant political shift within the French-speaking constituencies, primarily Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region. A notable trend was the success of centre-right parties, particularly the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), which emerged as a dominant force in both regions <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nIn Wallonia, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) achieved a significant victory. The results indicated a clear win for right and centre-right parties, with MR securing 26 seats and Les Engagés (formerly CDH) obtaining 17 seats in the Walloon Parliament. This outcome enabled these two parties to quickly form a centre-right coalition government in the region <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>. The new Walloon Government, along with the French Community Government (also led by an MR-Les Engagés coalition), was formed by July 11, 2024, signaling a relatively swift transition driven by the electoral success of MR and Les Engagés and the electoral setback for the Socialist Party (PS) <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>. The MR party president, Georges-Louis Bouchez, interpreted the election results as a public desire for \"change and reform\" <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels-Capital Region:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region also witnessed a major political realignment among its French-speaking electorate. For the first time in 15 years, MR became the largest French-speaking party in the region. They secured just under 26% of the vote among French-speaking parties in Brussels, a significant increase from their 2019 score of 16.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>. Voters in Brussels have the unique option to vote for either French-speaking or Dutch-speaking party lists, with the French-speaking college being considerably larger, which is reflected in the seat distribution <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/EZ_eupinions_Belgium_the_War_and_the_Vote_02.2024.pdf</citation>. While MR saw overall success, local results varied; for instance, in the Anderlecht municipality of Brussels, the Belgian Worker's Party (PTB/PVDA) emerged as the most popular party, followed by the PS and then MR <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\n**Key French-speaking Parties and Dynamics:**\nSeveral parties play significant roles in the French-speaking political landscape:\n*   **Mouvement Réformateur (MR):** (Liberals) Emerged as the main victor in both Wallonia and Brussels, leading the new Walloon government with Les Engagés <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation> <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n*   **Parti Socialiste (PS):** (Social Democrats) Traditionally a dominant force, the PS experienced an electoral decline but remains a significant player, particularly at the local level in Brussels <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n*   **Les Engagés:** (Christian Democrats, formerly CDH) Partnered with MR to form the government in Wallonia and the French Community, marking a successful election for the rebranded party <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>.\n*   **Parti du Travail de Belgique (PTB/PVDA):** (Radical Left) This party, the only significant national party in Belgium, continued its breakthrough in the French-speaking community, showing strong performance in certain urban areas like Anderlecht <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160-with-the-radical-right-pushing-ahead-in-flanders-and-the-radical-left-in-wallonia-belgium-could-be-divided-after-the-elections</citation>.\n*   **Ecolo:** (Greens) Another key party in the French-speaking sphere <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n*   **DéFI (Démocrate Fédéraliste Indépendant):** A centrist party with a primary focus on Brussels <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-the-key-players-in-defi</citation> <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe election outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies indicated a shift towards the centre-right and a desire for political change, leading to new governing coalitions in Wallonia and a reshaped political hierarchy in Brussels.\n## Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls leading up to the 2024 Belgian federal election on June 9th indicated a shifting political landscape, marked by the rise of parties on the far-right and far-left, and a decline in support for several traditional mainstream parties. The overall picture suggested a potentially complex government formation process post-election.\n\n**General Trends**\nPolls consistently showed a weakening of traditional party families (liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats), who collectively garnered less than 50% of the vote in the 2019 elections for the first time since WWII <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. This trend appeared to continue, with more radical alternatives gaining traction. The far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) and the far-left Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB) both saw significant increases in support in polling compared to their 2019 results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. The Prime Minister's party, Open Vld, faced predictions of historically low results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Polling by Region**\n\n**Flanders:**\nIn Flanders, the political discourse was heavily influenced by issues of regional identity and immigration.\n*   The far-right, Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang (VB) consistently polled as one of the largest, if not the largest, party. An Ipsos poll from June 4, 2024, placed VB at 25.8% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Earlier polls in April 2024 also suggested VB would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), another right-leaning Flemish nationalist party, was typically the second-largest party in polls, with the June 4, 2024 Ipsos poll showing them at 21% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The socialist party Vooruit (formerly sp.a) had shown positive trends but saw a dip in support following controversies surrounding its former chairman, polling around 11-15% in 2024. The June 4th poll had Vooruit (VO) at 15.6% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The Christian Democrats (CD&V) were polling around 12.3% in early June 2024 <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PVDA) showed significant gains in Flanders, polling at 10.2% in early June 2024, nearly double its 2019 score <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Open Vld (OVLD), the Flemish liberal party of the Prime Minister, polled at 7%, a significant drop <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.

An Ipsos poll from May 20, 2024, showed PS at 22.6%, neck-and-neck with MR <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. An earlier Kantar poll from April 18, 2024, had PS leading more clearly at 25.4% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) was the second major force, polling at 22.6% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB, the francophone wing of PVDA) also showed strong support, polling at 14.5% (Ipsos, May 20) to 16% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Les Engagés (LE, formerly cdH, centrist) showed improvement, polling at 18.1% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Ecolo (Francophone Greens) were polling around 8.8% (Ipsos, May 20) to 12.7% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>, indicating a loss of support compared to previous elections <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual but largely French-speaking, presented a distinct political dynamic.\n*   Final opinion polls conducted between May 29-31, 2024, indicated that for federal voting intentions, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) held a \"healthy lead\" at 22.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. This was also reflected in earlier 2024 polls, such as an Ipsos poll from March 18, 2024, which placed MR at 21.8% in Brussels <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) was reported as \"tailing\" MR in the final May polls at 19.8%, representing a significant increase from their 2019 federal election result <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The March 18 Ipsos poll showed PVDA at 17.5% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) polled at 15.4% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Some later polls from PolitPro showed varying figures, with one May 20 Ipsos poll indicating Open VLD surprisingly high, which seemed to be an outlier compared to other data and analyses <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Ecolo, the francophone Greens, polled at 14.7% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**National Outlook and Seat Projections**\nWhile specific nationwide seat projections varied between pollsters, the LSE Europp blog in April 2024 noted that Vlaams Belang's projected support in Flanders could translate to approximately 25 seats in the 150-seat federal Chamber of Representatives, potentially making it the largest single party in parliament <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. An April 2023 poll analysis by The Brussels Times suggested that the then-current seven-party \"Vivaldi\" federal government coalition (PS, MR, Ecolo, Groen, CD&V, Open VLD, Vooruit) was projected to retain a slim majority of 81 seats, down from 87 in 2019 <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>. However, the declining fortunes of parties like Open Vld suggested that even if a similar coalition were mathematically possible, the internal dynamics would shift significantly <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\nThe rise of extremist parties (PVDA-PTB and Vlaams Belang), with whom most mainstream parties refused to govern (the \"cordon sanitaire\" against Vlaams Belang being a key factor), pointed towards another potentially lengthy and complicated government formation process <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Background\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

In Flanders, the centre-right N-VA, led by Antwerp mayor Bart De Wever, equally surprised pollsters by managing to remain the biggest Flemish party ahead of the right-wing populist Vlaams Belang, kept out of government with a cordon sanitaire imposed by all other political parties. In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. As a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: Belgian political system\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: The Belgian Government and Politics in Belgium\\nURL: https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/\\nCONTENT: Belgium's political system and governing body.

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections 2024: results and potential coalitions\\nURL: https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/\\nCONTENT: At federal level, Vivaldi II is unlikely: the outgoing centre-left “Vivaldi” coalition composed of socialists, liberals, greens (of both Dutch- and French-speaking parties) as well as CD&V (Dutch-speaking christian democrats, EPP) gathered a very narrow majority of 76 seats. In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix.

Despite polls predicting that the far-right, anti-immigration Vlaams Belang party would become the main political force in the country with 11.5 million inhabitants, the right-wing nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) retained its first spot, with an expected 22% of the votes, according to provisional results provided by the Interior ministry.

These elections were conducted concurrently with regional parliamentary elections and the European Parliament elections, creating a \"super Sunday\" of voting that shaped governance at multiple levels <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation>.\n\nBelgium operates as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy. In this system, the King serves as a symbolic head of state, while the substantive political power rests with the Prime Minister and the federal government, which is accountable to a bicameral federal parliament <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation>. The country's political system is renowned for its complexity, largely due to its organization around representing the main linguistic and cultural communities: the Dutch-speaking Flemish, the French-speaking Walloons, and a smaller German-speaking community. Since approximately 1970, major national political parties have bifurcated along linguistic lines, creating distinct Flemish and Francophone parties <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation> <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>. This intricate structure is the result of six state reforms undertaken between 1970 and 2014, which progressively transformed Belgium into a federal state composed of communities and regions, often reflecting and attempting to manage ongoing political tensions and regional divergences <citation>https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federale_staat</citation> <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>.

Despite Belgium having a system of compulsory voting (introduced in 1893), it recorded one of the lowest voter turnouts since the system's inception <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The political climate leading up to the election was characterized by a discernible shift to the right, heightened political polarization, and growing support for radical parties <citation>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391326019_The_2024_Belgian_federal_elections_a_race_to_the_right</citation> <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. Key issues that dominated public and political discourse included persistent debates over state reform and the extent of Flemish autonomy, the need for fiscal consolidation, contentious immigration policies, and the anticipated performance of far-right parties, particularly Vlaams Belang in Flanders <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation> <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation> <citation>https://apnews.com/article/eu-belgium-federal-elections-flanders-vlaams-belang-ed0b519037e1e97cc9519c2637b500e0</citation>.

The nation's political framework is notably complex, largely structured to represent its main linguistic and cultural communities: Dutch-speaking Flanders, French-speaking Wallonia, and the bilingual Brussels-Capital Region, alongside a smaller German-speaking community <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation> <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>.

Consequently, national political parties have largely bifurcated along linguistic lines since approximately 1970, leading to distinct Flemish and Francophone political landscapes <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>.\n\nThe period leading up to the 2024 federal election was marked by a coalition government led by Prime Minister Alexander De Croo of the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD). This \"Vivaldi\" coalition, comprising liberals, socialists, greens from both language groups, and the Flemish Christian Democrats (CD&V), took a protracted 494 days to form following the May 2019 federal election <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation> <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>. The 2019 election had already highlighted a significant political divergence within the country, with Flanders predominantly voting for right-leaning parties and Wallonia showing strong support for the left <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. This underlying regional political discord has historically fueled discussions around further state reforms <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>.\n\nThe federal elections on June 9, 2024, coincided with regional and European Parliament elections, creating a \"super Sunday\" of voting <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation> <citation>https://apnews.com/article/eu-belgium-federal-elections-flanders-vlaams-belang-ed0b519037e1e97cc9519c2637b500e0</citation>.

Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7.

Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Execute safe mathematical expressions.\\n\\nSupports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **) and common mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc.).\\nFor security reasons, only mathematical expressions are allowed, no arbitrary code execution.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Mathematical expression to calculate, e.g., \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\", \\\"sin(30 * pi / 180)\\\", \\\"sqrt(16)\\\"\"}}, \"required\": [\"expression\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n"

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件,要求详细全面\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election marked a significant political shift within the French-speaking constituencies, primarily Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region. A notable trend was the success of centre-right parties, particularly the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), which emerged as a dominant force in both regions <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nIn Wallonia, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) achieved a significant victory. The results indicated a clear win for right and centre-right parties, with MR securing 26 seats and Les Engagés (formerly CDH) obtaining 17 seats in the Walloon Parliament. This outcome enabled these two parties to quickly form a centre-right coalition government in the region <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>. The new Walloon Government, along with the French Community Government (also led by an MR-Les Engagés coalition), was formed by July 11, 2024, signaling a relatively swift transition driven by the electoral success of MR and Les Engagés and the electoral setback for the Socialist Party (PS) <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>. The MR party president, Georges-Louis Bouchez, interpreted the election results as a public desire for \"change and reform\" <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels-Capital Region:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region also witnessed a major political realignment among its French-speaking electorate. For the first time in 15 years, MR became the largest French-speaking party in the region. They secured just under 26% of the vote among French-speaking parties in Brussels, a significant increase from their 2019 score of 16.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>. Voters in Brussels have the unique option to vote for either French-speaking or Dutch-speaking party lists, with the French-speaking college being considerably larger, which is reflected in the seat distribution <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/EZ_eupinions_Belgium_the_War_and_the_Vote_02.2024.pdf</citation>. While MR saw overall success, local results varied; for instance, in the Anderlecht municipality of Brussels, the Belgian Worker's Party (PTB/PVDA) emerged as the most popular party, followed by the PS and then MR <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\n**Key French-speaking Parties and Dynamics:**\nSeveral parties play significant roles in the French-speaking political landscape:\n*   **Mouvement Réformateur (MR):** (Liberals) Emerged as the main victor in both Wallonia and Brussels, leading the new Walloon government with Les Engagés <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation> <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n*   **Parti Socialiste (PS):** (Social Democrats) Traditionally a dominant force, the PS experienced an electoral decline but remains a significant player, particularly at the local level in Brussels <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n*   **Les Engagés:** (Christian Democrats, formerly CDH) Partnered with MR to form the government in Wallonia and the French Community, marking a successful election for the rebranded party <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>.\n*   **Parti du Travail de Belgique (PTB/PVDA):** (Radical Left) This party, the only significant national party in Belgium, continued its breakthrough in the French-speaking community, showing strong performance in certain urban areas like Anderlecht <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160-with-the-radical-right-pushing-ahead-in-flanders-and-the-radical-left-in-wallonia-belgium-could-be-divided-after-the-elections</citation>.\n*   **Ecolo:** (Greens) Another key party in the French-speaking sphere <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n*   **DéFI (Démocrate Fédéraliste Indépendant):** A centrist party with a primary focus on Brussels <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-the-key-players-in-defi</citation> <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe election outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies indicated a shift towards the centre-right and a desire for political change, leading to new governing coalitions in Wallonia and a reshaped political hierarchy in Brussels.\n## Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls leading up to the 2024 Belgian federal election on June 9th indicated a shifting political landscape, marked by the rise of parties on the far-right and far-left, and a decline in support for several traditional mainstream parties. The overall picture suggested a potentially complex government formation process post-election.\n\n**General Trends**\nPolls consistently showed a weakening of traditional party families (liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats), who collectively garnered less than 50% of the vote in the 2019 elections for the first time since WWII <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. This trend appeared to continue, with more radical alternatives gaining traction. The far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) and the far-left Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB) both saw significant increases in support in polling compared to their 2019 results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. The Prime Minister's party, Open Vld, faced predictions of historically low results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Polling by Region**\n\n**Flanders:**\nIn Flanders, the political discourse was heavily influenced by issues of regional identity and immigration.\n*   The far-right, Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang (VB) consistently polled as one of the largest, if not the largest, party. An Ipsos poll from June 4, 2024, placed VB at 25.8% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Earlier polls in April 2024 also suggested VB would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), another right-leaning Flemish nationalist party, was typically the second-largest party in polls, with the June 4, 2024 Ipsos poll showing them at 21% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The socialist party Vooruit (formerly sp.a) had shown positive trends but saw a dip in support following controversies surrounding its former chairman, polling around 11-15% in 2024. The June 4th poll had Vooruit (VO) at 15.6% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The Christian Democrats (CD&V) were polling around 12.3% in early June 2024 <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PVDA) showed significant gains in Flanders, polling at 10.2% in early June 2024, nearly double its 2019 score <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Open Vld (OVLD), the Flemish liberal party of the Prime Minister, polled at 7%, a significant drop <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Groen (Flemish Greens) were at 6.1% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nWallonia, the French-speaking southern region, generally leaned more to the left.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) traditionally led in Wallonia. An Ipsos poll from May 20, 2024, showed PS at 22.6%, neck-and-neck with MR <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. An earlier Kantar poll from April 18, 2024, had PS leading more clearly at 25.4% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) was the second major force, polling at 22.6% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB, the francophone wing of PVDA) also showed strong support, polling at 14.5% (Ipsos, May 20) to 16% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Les Engagés (LE, formerly cdH, centrist) showed improvement, polling at 18.1% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Ecolo (Francophone Greens) were polling around 8.8% (Ipsos, May 20) to 12.7% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>, indicating a loss of support compared to previous elections <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual but largely French-speaking, presented a distinct political dynamic.\n*   Final opinion polls conducted between May 29-31, 2024, indicated that for federal voting intentions, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) held a \"healthy lead\" at 22.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. This was also reflected in earlier 2024 polls, such as an Ipsos poll from March 18, 2024, which placed MR at 21.8% in Brussels <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) was reported as \"tailing\" MR in the final May polls at 19.8%, representing a significant increase from their 2019 federal election result <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The March 18 Ipsos poll showed PVDA at 17.5% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) polled at 15.4% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Some later polls from PolitPro showed varying figures, with one May 20 Ipsos poll indicating Open VLD surprisingly high, which seemed to be an outlier compared to other data and analyses <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Ecolo, the francophone Greens, polled at 14.7% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**National Outlook and Seat Projections**\nWhile specific nationwide seat projections varied between pollsters, the LSE Europp blog in April 2024 noted that Vlaams Belang's projected support in Flanders could translate to approximately 25 seats in the 150-seat federal Chamber of Representatives, potentially making it the largest single party in parliament <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. An April 2023 poll analysis by The Brussels Times suggested that the then-current seven-party \"Vivaldi\" federal government coalition (PS, MR, Ecolo, Groen, CD&V, Open VLD, Vooruit) was projected to retain a slim majority of 81 seats, down from 87 in 2019 <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>. However, the declining fortunes of parties like Open Vld suggested that even if a similar coalition were mathematically possible, the internal dynamics would shift significantly <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\nThe rise of extremist parties (PVDA-PTB and Vlaams Belang), with whom most mainstream parties refused to govern (the \"cordon sanitaire\" against Vlaams Belang being a key factor), pointed towards another potentially lengthy and complicated government formation process <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n## Background\n\nBelgium's political system is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, characterized by a complex structure designed to accommodate its linguistic and cultural diversity <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation> <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>. The country is divided into three regions (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels-Capital) and three language communities (Flemish, French, and German-speaking). This division is deeply reflected in its political landscape, with most major political parties having distinct Flemish (Dutch-speaking) and Francophone (French-speaking) counterparts <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>. The King serves as the symbolic head of state, while actual executive power resides with the Prime Minister and the federal government <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation>. Historically, Belgium has undergone several state reforms, evolving into its current federal structure, to manage regional and linguistic tensions <citation>https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federale_staat</citation>. Coalition governments are the norm, often requiring lengthy negotiations among multiple parties to form a majority in the federal parliament. This system, sometimes referred to as a \"particracy,\" underscores the significant role of political parties in governance <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>.\n\nThe period leading up to the 2024 federal election was marked by significant political fragmentation. The previous federal government, a seven-party coalition known as the \"Vivaldi\" coalition led by Prime Minister Alexander De Croo (Open VLD), took 494 days to form following the May 2019 elections <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. The 2019 election had already highlighted a divided political landscape, with Flanders voting predominantly for right-leaning parties and Wallonia for left-leaning parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. Heading into 2024, there was widespread anticipation of a further shift to the right, particularly in Flanders with the rise of the far-right Vlaams Belang party in opinion polls <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation> <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation>. Increased political polarization was also a noted trend <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election was held on June 9, 2024, coinciding with the European Parliament elections and regional elections, making it a \"triple election\" day for Belgian voters <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation>. This election was significant as it was the first federal vote since the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also marked by one of the lowest voter turnouts recorded since compulsory voting was introduced in 1893, despite the legal obligation to vote <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. Key themes dominating the pre-election discourse included socio-economic issues, migration, the potential for further state reform, and the persistent challenge of forming stable governing coalitions in Belgium's complex political environment <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Preface\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders.

In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix. On the opposite side, the right and centre-right parties harboured a landslide victory totalling 26 seats for MR and 17 seats for Les Engagés in the Walloon Parliament allowing both parties to form a centre-right coalition government.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: Belgium: the 2024 federal elections - deadlock ahead?\\nURL: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/\\nCONTENT: Since October 2020, Belgium has been governed by a coalition of seven parties (the so-called “Vivaldi” coalition) – excluding the two largest parties in Flanders, the N-VA and VB – with Alexander De Croo, leading figure of the Open Vld, as prime minister. Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament. Another coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[9]:\\nTITLE: Who's in Belgium's new Federal Government? - brusselstimes.com\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1424985/whos-in-belgiums-new-federal-government\\nCONTENT: Belgium's new Federal 'Arizona' Government was sworn in on Monday morning before King Philippe, giving the country a fully-fledged administration after nearly eight months.

In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. As a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: 2024年比利时联邦选举主要政党\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: 国家概况_中华人民共和国外交部\\nURL: https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/gjhdq_676201/gj_676203/oz_678770/1206_678940/1206x0_678942/\\nCONTENT: 2024年6月9日，比利时举行联邦、地方、欧洲议会\\\"三合一\\\"选举。7月10日，新弗拉芒联盟党议员彼得·德鲁弗（Peter De Roover）当选联邦众议院议长。 2025年2月21日，参议员文森特·布隆代尔（Vincent Blondel）出任联邦参议院议长。 ... 【政 党】主要政党有：\\n--------------------------------------------------\"</result></tool_use_result>"

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件,要求详细全面\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election marked a significant political shift within the French-speaking constituencies, primarily Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region. A notable trend was the success of centre-right parties, particularly the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), which emerged as a dominant force in both regions <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nIn Wallonia, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) achieved a significant victory. The results indicated a clear win for right and centre-right parties, with MR securing 26 seats and Les Engagés (formerly CDH) obtaining 17 seats in the Walloon Parliament. This outcome enabled these two parties to quickly form a centre-right coalition government in the region <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>. The new Walloon Government, along with the French Community Government (also led by an MR-Les Engagés coalition), was formed by July 11, 2024, signaling a relatively swift transition driven by the electoral success of MR and Les Engagés and the electoral setback for the Socialist Party (PS) <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>. The MR party president, Georges-Louis Bouchez, interpreted the election results as a public desire for \"change and reform\" <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels-Capital Region:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region also witnessed a major political realignment among its French-speaking electorate. For the first time in 15 years, MR became the largest French-speaking party in the region. They secured just under 26% of the vote among French-speaking parties in Brussels, a significant increase from their 2019 score of 16.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>. Voters in Brussels have the unique option to vote for either French-speaking or Dutch-speaking party lists, with the French-speaking college being considerably larger, which is reflected in the seat distribution <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/EZ_eupinions_Belgium_the_War_and_the_Vote_02.2024.pdf</citation>. While MR saw overall success, local results varied; for instance, in the Anderlecht municipality of Brussels, the Belgian Worker's Party (PTB/PVDA) emerged as the most popular party, followed by the PS and then MR <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\n**Key French-speaking Parties and Dynamics:**\nSeveral parties play significant roles in the French-speaking political landscape:\n*   **Mouvement Réformateur (MR):** (Liberals) Emerged as the main victor in both Wallonia and Brussels, leading the new Walloon government with Les Engagés <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation> <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n*   **Parti Socialiste (PS):** (Social Democrats) Traditionally a dominant force, the PS experienced an electoral decline but remains a significant player, particularly at the local level in Brussels <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n*   **Les Engagés:** (Christian Democrats, formerly CDH) Partnered with MR to form the government in Wallonia and the French Community, marking a successful election for the rebranded party <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>.\n*   **Parti du Travail de Belgique (PTB/PVDA):** (Radical Left) This party, the only significant national party in Belgium, continued its breakthrough in the French-speaking community, showing strong performance in certain urban areas like Anderlecht <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160-with-the-radical-right-pushing-ahead-in-flanders-and-the-radical-left-in-wallonia-belgium-could-be-divided-after-the-elections</citation>.\n*   **Ecolo:** (Greens) Another key party in the French-speaking sphere <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n*   **DéFI (Démocrate Fédéraliste Indépendant):** A centrist party with a primary focus on Brussels <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-the-key-players-in-defi</citation> <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe election outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies indicated a shift towards the centre-right and a desire for political change, leading to new governing coalitions in Wallonia and a reshaped political hierarchy in Brussels.\n## Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls leading up to the 2024 Belgian federal election on June 9th indicated a shifting political landscape, marked by the rise of parties on the far-right and far-left, and a decline in support for several traditional mainstream parties. The overall picture suggested a potentially complex government formation process post-election.\n\n**General Trends**\nPolls consistently showed a weakening of traditional party families (liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats), who collectively garnered less than 50% of the vote in the 2019 elections for the first time since WWII <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. This trend appeared to continue, with more radical alternatives gaining traction. The far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) and the far-left Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB) both saw significant increases in support in polling compared to their 2019 results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. The Prime Minister's party, Open Vld, faced predictions of historically low results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Polling by Region**\n\n**Flanders:**\nIn Flanders, the political discourse was heavily influenced by issues of regional identity and immigration.\n*   The far-right, Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang (VB) consistently polled as one of the largest, if not the largest, party. An Ipsos poll from June 4, 2024, placed VB at 25.8% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Earlier polls in April 2024 also suggested VB would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), another right-leaning Flemish nationalist party, was typically the second-largest party in polls, with the June 4, 2024 Ipsos poll showing them at 21% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The socialist party Vooruit (formerly sp.a) had shown positive trends but saw a dip in support following controversies surrounding its former chairman, polling around 11-15% in 2024. The June 4th poll had Vooruit (VO) at 15.6% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The Christian Democrats (CD&V) were polling around 12.3% in early June 2024 <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PVDA) showed significant gains in Flanders, polling at 10.2% in early June 2024, nearly double its 2019 score <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Open Vld (OVLD), the Flemish liberal party of the Prime Minister, polled at 7%, a significant drop <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Groen (Flemish Greens) were at 6.1% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nWallonia, the French-speaking southern region, generally leaned more to the left.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) traditionally led in Wallonia. An Ipsos poll from May 20, 2024, showed PS at 22.6%, neck-and-neck with MR <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. An earlier Kantar poll from April 18, 2024, had PS leading more clearly at 25.4% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) was the second major force, polling at 22.6% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB, the francophone wing of PVDA) also showed strong support, polling at 14.5% (Ipsos, May 20) to 16% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Les Engagés (LE, formerly cdH, centrist) showed improvement, polling at 18.1% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Ecolo (Francophone Greens) were polling around 8.8% (Ipsos, May 20) to 12.7% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>, indicating a loss of support compared to previous elections <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual but largely French-speaking, presented a distinct political dynamic.\n*   Final opinion polls conducted between May 29-31, 2024, indicated that for federal voting intentions, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) held a \"healthy lead\" at 22.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. This was also reflected in earlier 2024 polls, such as an Ipsos poll from March 18, 2024, which placed MR at 21.8% in Brussels <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) was reported as \"tailing\" MR in the final May polls at 19.8%, representing a significant increase from their 2019 federal election result <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The March 18 Ipsos poll showed PVDA at 17.5% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) polled at 15.4% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Some later polls from PolitPro showed varying figures, with one May 20 Ipsos poll indicating Open VLD surprisingly high, which seemed to be an outlier compared to other data and analyses <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Ecolo, the francophone Greens, polled at 14.7% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**National Outlook and Seat Projections**\nWhile specific nationwide seat projections varied between pollsters, the LSE Europp blog in April 2024 noted that Vlaams Belang's projected support in Flanders could translate to approximately 25 seats in the 150-seat federal Chamber of Representatives, potentially making it the largest single party in parliament <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. An April 2023 poll analysis by The Brussels Times suggested that the then-current seven-party \"Vivaldi\" federal government coalition (PS, MR, Ecolo, Groen, CD&V, Open VLD, Vooruit) was projected to retain a slim majority of 81 seats, down from 87 in 2019 <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>. However, the declining fortunes of parties like Open Vld suggested that even if a similar coalition were mathematically possible, the internal dynamics would shift significantly <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\nThe rise of extremist parties (PVDA-PTB and Vlaams Belang), with whom most mainstream parties refused to govern (the \"cordon sanitaire\" against Vlaams Belang being a key factor), pointed towards another potentially lengthy and complicated government formation process <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n## Background\n\nBelgium's political system is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, characterized by a complex structure designed to accommodate its linguistic and cultural diversity <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation> <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>. The country is divided into three regions (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels-Capital) and three language communities (Flemish, French, and German-speaking). This division is deeply reflected in its political landscape, with most major political parties having distinct Flemish (Dutch-speaking) and Francophone (French-speaking) counterparts <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>. The King serves as the symbolic head of state, while actual executive power resides with the Prime Minister and the federal government <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation>. Historically, Belgium has undergone several state reforms, evolving into its current federal structure, to manage regional and linguistic tensions <citation>https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federale_staat</citation>. Coalition governments are the norm, often requiring lengthy negotiations among multiple parties to form a majority in the federal parliament. This system, sometimes referred to as a \"particracy,\" underscores the significant role of political parties in governance <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>.\n\nThe period leading up to the 2024 federal election was marked by significant political fragmentation. The previous federal government, a seven-party coalition known as the \"Vivaldi\" coalition led by Prime Minister Alexander De Croo (Open VLD), took 494 days to form following the May 2019 elections <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. The 2019 election had already highlighted a divided political landscape, with Flanders voting predominantly for right-leaning parties and Wallonia for left-leaning parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. Heading into 2024, there was widespread anticipation of a further shift to the right, particularly in Flanders with the rise of the far-right Vlaams Belang party in opinion polls <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation> <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation>. Increased political polarization was also a noted trend <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election was held on June 9, 2024, coinciding with the European Parliament elections and regional elections, making it a \"triple election\" day for Belgian voters <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation>. This election was significant as it was the first federal vote since the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also marked by one of the lowest voter turnouts recorded since compulsory voting was introduced in 1893, despite the legal obligation to vote <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. Key themes dominating the pre-election discourse included socio-economic issues, migration, the potential for further state reform, and the persistent challenge of forming stable governing coalitions in Belgium's complex political environment <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n## Preface\n\n比利时于2024年6月9日举行了联邦选举，这一天对比利时的政治格局具有重要意义 <citation>https://research.usfq.edu.ec/en/publications/the-2024-belgian-federal-elections-a-race-to-the-right</citation> <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/belgium-2024-election.html</citation>。此次联邦选举与欧洲议会选举和地区选举同日进行，构成了比利时政治日历中一个关键的“超级星期日” <citation>http://www.huashang.be/index/news/detail/id/401.html</citation> <citation>https://www.sohu.com/a/784917024_121124414</citation>。比利时以其复杂的多党制、语言社群的分立以及由此产生的联合政府而闻名，使得每一次联邦选举都备受关注 <citation>https://www.oushinet.com/static/content/international/guojinews/2023-12-28/1189974852875879752.html</citation>。\n\n本次选举是在一个充满挑战的背景下进行的，包括后疫情时代的经济复苏、地区间的持续张力以及欧洲整体政治风向的转变。选举结果不仅将决定未来联邦政府的组成，也将对国家未来的政策走向，乃至其在欧盟中的角色产生深远影响。部分观察家认为，2024年的选举可能成为比利时政治史上的一个“转折点” <citation>https://research.usfq.edu.ec/en/publications/the-2024-belgian-federal-elections-a-race-to-the-right</citation> <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>。本报告旨在全面回顾和分析2024年比利时联邦选举的背景、主要参与方、关键议题、选举结果及其对国家政治的潜在影响。\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Retiring incumbents\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

When asked about the reasons behind the Workers' Party's breakthrough in the kingdom's French-speaking community since the previous general elections on 26 May 2019, Emilie van Haute, professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels, explains: \\\"The nature of the public debate is quite different: in Flanders, it is much more focused on migration issues, which is very favourable to Vlaams Belang, the party that has made these issues its main campaign theme.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Belgium's make-or-break election, explained - POLITICO\\nURL: https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/\\nCONTENT: The far-right Vlaams Belang is polling to win up to 27 percent of Flemish votes, making it the largest party in the country — in line with Europe’s expected far-right surge.

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: King Philippe's role in the formation of Belgium's next government\\nURL: https://www.thebulletin.be/king-philippes-role-formation-belgiums-next-government\\nCONTENT: King Philippe’s role in the formation of Belgium’s next government | The Bulletin King Philippe’s role in the formation of Belgium’s next government Following his party’s defeat in the national elections, prime minister Alexander De Croo (Open VLD) formally tendered his resignation on Monday morning after a visit to King Philippe.

Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament. Another coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections 2024: results and potential coalitions\\nURL: https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/\\nCONTENT: At federal level, Vivaldi II is unlikely: the outgoing centre-left “Vivaldi” coalition composed of socialists, liberals, greens (of both Dutch- and French-speaking parties) as well as CD&V (Dutch-speaking christian democrats, EPP) gathered a very narrow majority of 76 seats. In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix. On the opposite side, the right and centre-right parties harboured a landslide victory totalling 26 seats for MR and 17 seats for Les Engagés in the Walloon Parliament allowing both parties to form a centre-right coalition government.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: 2024 Elections - A wind of change to the right?

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: General Elections 2024 Belgium - Robert Schuman\\nURL: https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160-with-the-radical-right-pushing-ahead-in-flanders-and-the-radical-left-in-wallonia-belgium-could-be-divided-after-the-elections\\nCONTENT: According to an opinion poll carried out by the Kantar Institute for RTBF and the daily La Libre Belgique, the Vlaams Belang (VB) is expected to come out ahead in the general elections in Flanders with 26% of the vote, followed by the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) with 20.9% and the Workers’ Party (PTVB/PVDA) with 12.2%. When asked about the reasons behind the Workers' Party's breakthrough in the kingdom's French-speaking community since the previous general elections on 26 May 2019, Emilie van Haute, professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels, explains: \\\"The nature of the public debate is quite different: in Flanders, it is much more focused on migration issues, which is very favourable to Vlaams Belang, the party that has made these issues its main campaign theme.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections 2024: results and potential coalitions\\nURL: https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/\\nCONTENT: At federal level, Vivaldi II is unlikely: the outgoing centre-left “Vivaldi” coalition composed of socialists, liberals, greens (of both Dutch- and French-speaking parties) as well as CD&V (Dutch-speaking christian democrats, EPP) gathered a very narrow majority of 76 seats. In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix.

These departures often come with significant severance packages, which have been a subject of public discussion.\n\nSeveral long-serving and prominent politicians were among those leaving their parliamentary roles. For instance:\n*   **Patrick Dewael** (Open VLD), a former Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives, concluded a political career spanning 40 years. Upon his departure, he was eligible for a severance payment of €507,024 <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.\n*   **Maggie De Block** (Open VLD), a former Minister of Health, also announced her resignation. After her years of service, she was eligible for a severance payment of €316,000 <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.\n\nBeyond these specific figures, the election results led to a broader change in parliamentary composition. Reports indicated that a significant number of deputies would not be returning. For example, one source stated that 207 Belgian deputies lost their seats in the elections <citation>https://www.levif.be/belgique/politique/les-deputes-non-reelus-vont-ils-reellement-couter-36-millions-deuros-a-letat-belge-voici-comment-fonctionnent-les-indemnites-de-sortie/</citation>. In the Brussels regional parliament alone, eighteen outgoing deputies who stood for re-election were not successful <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/bruxelles-dix-huit-deputes-bruxellois-nont-pas-ete-reelus-dimanche/2024-06-10/article/678480</citation>.\n\nThe system of severance pay for departing parliamentarians, whether they retire or are not re-elected, has drawn attention. These payments are calculated based on years of service, with one year in parliament corresponding to roughly two months of gross salary.

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件,要求详细全面\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election marked a significant political shift within the French-speaking constituencies, primarily Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region. A notable trend was the success of centre-right parties, particularly the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), which emerged as a dominant force in both regions <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nIn Wallonia, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) achieved a significant victory. The results indicated a clear win for right and centre-right parties, with MR securing 26 seats and Les Engagés (formerly CDH) obtaining 17 seats in the Walloon Parliament. This outcome enabled these two parties to quickly form a centre-right coalition government in the region <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>. The new Walloon Government, along with the French Community Government (also led by an MR-Les Engagés coalition), was formed by July 11, 2024, signaling a relatively swift transition driven by the electoral success of MR and Les Engagés and the electoral setback for the Socialist Party (PS) <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>. The MR party president, Georges-Louis Bouchez, interpreted the election results as a public desire for \"change and reform\" <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels-Capital Region:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region also witnessed a major political realignment among its French-speaking electorate. For the first time in 15 years, MR became the largest French-speaking party in the region. They secured just under 26% of the vote among French-speaking parties in Brussels, a significant increase from their 2019 score of 16.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>. Voters in Brussels have the unique option to vote for either French-speaking or Dutch-speaking party lists, with the French-speaking college being considerably larger, which is reflected in the seat distribution <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/EZ_eupinions_Belgium_the_War_and_the_Vote_02.2024.pdf</citation>. While MR saw overall success, local results varied; for instance, in the Anderlecht municipality of Brussels, the Belgian Worker's Party (PTB/PVDA) emerged as the most popular party, followed by the PS and then MR <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\n**Key French-speaking Parties and Dynamics:**\nSeveral parties play significant roles in the French-speaking political landscape:\n*   **Mouvement Réformateur (MR):** (Liberals) Emerged as the main victor in both Wallonia and Brussels, leading the new Walloon government with Les Engagés <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation> <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n*   **Parti Socialiste (PS):** (Social Democrats) Traditionally a dominant force, the PS experienced an electoral decline but remains a significant player, particularly at the local level in Brussels <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n*   **Les Engagés:** (Christian Democrats, formerly CDH) Partnered with MR to form the government in Wallonia and the French Community, marking a successful election for the rebranded party <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>.\n*   **Parti du Travail de Belgique (PTB/PVDA):** (Radical Left) This party, the only significant national party in Belgium, continued its breakthrough in the French-speaking community, showing strong performance in certain urban areas like Anderlecht <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160-with-the-radical-right-pushing-ahead-in-flanders-and-the-radical-left-in-wallonia-belgium-could-be-divided-after-the-elections</citation>.\n*   **Ecolo:** (Greens) Another key party in the French-speaking sphere <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n*   **DéFI (Démocrate Fédéraliste Indépendant):** A centrist party with a primary focus on Brussels <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-the-key-players-in-defi</citation> <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe election outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies indicated a shift towards the centre-right and a desire for political change, leading to new governing coalitions in Wallonia and a reshaped political hierarchy in Brussels.\n## Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls leading up to the 2024 Belgian federal election on June 9th indicated a shifting political landscape, marked by the rise of parties on the far-right and far-left, and a decline in support for several traditional mainstream parties. The overall picture suggested a potentially complex government formation process post-election.\n\n**General Trends**\nPolls consistently showed a weakening of traditional party families (liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats), who collectively garnered less than 50% of the vote in the 2019 elections for the first time since WWII <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. This trend appeared to continue, with more radical alternatives gaining traction. The far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) and the far-left Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB) both saw significant increases in support in polling compared to their 2019 results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. The Prime Minister's party, Open Vld, faced predictions of historically low results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Polling by Region**\n\n**Flanders:**\nIn Flanders, the political discourse was heavily influenced by issues of regional identity and immigration.\n*   The far-right, Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang (VB) consistently polled as one of the largest, if not the largest, party. An Ipsos poll from June 4, 2024, placed VB at 25.8% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Earlier polls in April 2024 also suggested VB would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), another right-leaning Flemish nationalist party, was typically the second-largest party in polls, with the June 4, 2024 Ipsos poll showing them at 21% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The socialist party Vooruit (formerly sp.a) had shown positive trends but saw a dip in support following controversies surrounding its former chairman, polling around 11-15% in 2024. The June 4th poll had Vooruit (VO) at 15.6% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The Christian Democrats (CD&V) were polling around 12.3% in early June 2024 <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PVDA) showed significant gains in Flanders, polling at 10.2% in early June 2024, nearly double its 2019 score <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Open Vld (OVLD), the Flemish liberal party of the Prime Minister, polled at 7%, a significant drop <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Groen (Flemish Greens) were at 6.1% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nWallonia, the French-speaking southern region, generally leaned more to the left.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) traditionally led in Wallonia. An Ipsos poll from May 20, 2024, showed PS at 22.6%, neck-and-neck with MR <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. An earlier Kantar poll from April 18, 2024, had PS leading more clearly at 25.4% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) was the second major force, polling at 22.6% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB, the francophone wing of PVDA) also showed strong support, polling at 14.5% (Ipsos, May 20) to 16% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Les Engagés (LE, formerly cdH, centrist) showed improvement, polling at 18.1% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Ecolo (Francophone Greens) were polling around 8.8% (Ipsos, May 20) to 12.7% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>, indicating a loss of support compared to previous elections <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual but largely French-speaking, presented a distinct political dynamic.\n*   Final opinion polls conducted between May 29-31, 2024, indicated that for federal voting intentions, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) held a \"healthy lead\" at 22.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. This was also reflected in earlier 2024 polls, such as an Ipsos poll from March 18, 2024, which placed MR at 21.8% in Brussels <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) was reported as \"tailing\" MR in the final May polls at 19.8%, representing a significant increase from their 2019 federal election result <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The March 18 Ipsos poll showed PVDA at 17.5% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) polled at 15.4% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Some later polls from PolitPro showed varying figures, with one May 20 Ipsos poll indicating Open VLD surprisingly high, which seemed to be an outlier compared to other data and analyses <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Ecolo, the francophone Greens, polled at 14.7% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**National Outlook and Seat Projections**\nWhile specific nationwide seat projections varied between pollsters, the LSE Europp blog in April 2024 noted that Vlaams Belang's projected support in Flanders could translate to approximately 25 seats in the 150-seat federal Chamber of Representatives, potentially making it the largest single party in parliament <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. An April 2023 poll analysis by The Brussels Times suggested that the then-current seven-party \"Vivaldi\" federal government coalition (PS, MR, Ecolo, Groen, CD&V, Open VLD, Vooruit) was projected to retain a slim majority of 81 seats, down from 87 in 2019 <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>. However, the declining fortunes of parties like Open Vld suggested that even if a similar coalition were mathematically possible, the internal dynamics would shift significantly <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\nThe rise of extremist parties (PVDA-PTB and Vlaams Belang), with whom most mainstream parties refused to govern (the \"cordon sanitaire\" against Vlaams Belang being a key factor), pointed towards another potentially lengthy and complicated government formation process <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n## Background\n\nBelgium's political system is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, characterized by a complex structure designed to accommodate its linguistic and cultural diversity <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation> <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>. The country is divided into three regions (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels-Capital) and three language communities (Flemish, French, and German-speaking). This division is deeply reflected in its political landscape, with most major political parties having distinct Flemish (Dutch-speaking) and Francophone (French-speaking) counterparts <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>. The King serves as the symbolic head of state, while actual executive power resides with the Prime Minister and the federal government <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation>. Historically, Belgium has undergone several state reforms, evolving into its current federal structure, to manage regional and linguistic tensions <citation>https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federale_staat</citation>. Coalition governments are the norm, often requiring lengthy negotiations among multiple parties to form a majority in the federal parliament. This system, sometimes referred to as a \"particracy,\" underscores the significant role of political parties in governance <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>.\n\nThe period leading up to the 2024 federal election was marked by significant political fragmentation. The previous federal government, a seven-party coalition known as the \"Vivaldi\" coalition led by Prime Minister Alexander De Croo (Open VLD), took 494 days to form following the May 2019 elections <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. The 2019 election had already highlighted a divided political landscape, with Flanders voting predominantly for right-leaning parties and Wallonia for left-leaning parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. Heading into 2024, there was widespread anticipation of a further shift to the right, particularly in Flanders with the rise of the far-right Vlaams Belang party in opinion polls <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation> <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation>. Increased political polarization was also a noted trend <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election was held on June 9, 2024, coinciding with the European Parliament elections and regional elections, making it a \"triple election\" day for Belgian voters <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation>.

It was also marked by one of the lowest voter turnouts recorded since compulsory voting was introduced in 1893, despite the legal obligation to vote <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. Key themes dominating the pre-election discourse included socio-economic issues, migration, the potential for further state reform, and the persistent challenge of forming stable governing coalitions in Belgium's complex political environment <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n## Preface\n\n比利时于2024年6月9日举行了联邦选举，这一天对比利时的政治格局具有重要意义 <citation>https://research.usfq.edu.ec/en/publications/the-2024-belgian-federal-elections-a-race-to-the-right</citation> <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/belgium-2024-election.html</citation>。此次联邦选举与欧洲议会选举和地区选举同日进行，构成了比利时政治日历中一个关键的“超级星期日” <citation>http://www.huashang.be/index/news/detail/id/401.html</citation> <citation>https://www.sohu.com/a/784917024_121124414</citation>。比利时以其复杂的多党制、语言社群的分立以及由此产生的联合政府而闻名，使得每一次联邦选举都备受关注 <citation>https://www.oushinet.com/static/content/international/guojinews/2023-12-28/1189974852875879752.html</citation>。\n\n本次选举是在一个充满挑战的背景下进行的，包括后疫情时代的经济复苏、地区间的持续张力以及欧洲整体政治风向的转变。选举结果不仅将决定未来联邦政府的组成，也将对国家未来的政策走向，乃至其在欧盟中的角色产生深远影响。部分观察家认为，2024年的选举可能成为比利时政治史上的一个“转折点” <citation>https://research.usfq.edu.ec/en/publications/the-2024-belgian-federal-elections-a-race-to-the-right</citation> <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>。本报告旨在全面回顾和分析2024年比利时联邦选举的背景、主要参与方、关键议题、选举结果及其对国家政治的潜在影响。\n## Retiring Incumbents and Departures\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election cycle saw a number of established political figures depart from parliament, either through retirement, resignation, or by not being re-elected. These departures often come with significant severance packages, which have been a subject of public discussion.\n\nSeveral long-serving and prominent politicians were among those leaving their parliamentary roles. For instance:\n*   **Patrick Dewael** (Open VLD), a former Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives, concluded a political career spanning 40 years. Upon his departure, he was eligible for a severance payment of €507,024 <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.\n*   **Maggie De Block** (Open VLD), a former Minister of Health, also announced her resignation. After her years of service, she was eligible for a severance payment of €316,000 <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.\n\nBeyond these specific figures, the election results led to a broader change in parliamentary composition. Reports indicated that a significant number of deputies would not be returning. For example, one source stated that 207 Belgian deputies lost their seats in the elections <citation>https://www.levif.be/belgique/politique/les-deputes-non-reelus-vont-ils-reellement-couter-36-millions-deuros-a-letat-belge-voici-comment-fonctionnent-les-indemnites-de-sortie/</citation>. In the Brussels regional parliament alone, eighteen outgoing deputies who stood for re-election were not successful <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/bruxelles-dix-huit-deputes-bruxellois-nont-pas-ete-reelus-dimanche/2024-06-10/article/678480</citation>.\n\nThe system of severance pay for departing parliamentarians, whether they retire or are not re-elected, has drawn attention. These payments are calculated based on years of service, with one year in parliament corresponding to roughly two months of gross salary. For a federal MP, this could mean around €21,000 per year of service <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>. Some estimates suggested that the total cost of these severance packages for deputies not re-elected could reach tens of millions of euros <citation>https://www.lecho.be/dossiers/elections-en-belgique/les-deputes-non-reelus-recevront-ensemble-20-millions-d-euros-d-indemnites-de-depart/10551367.html</citation> <citation>https://www.dhnet.be/actu/belgique/2024/07/04/jackpot-pour-les-deputes-sortants-certains-toucheront-une-plantureuse-pension-ainsi-quun-demi-million-deuros-WU65XHBJVBE5RDBIN2J24WBQO4/</citation>. This system is designed in part because MPs are not entitled to standard unemployment benefits. However, there is a cap for those elected after 2014, limiting severance to 24 months of salary <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.\n\nThe departure of experienced politicians, whether by choice or electoral outcome, marks a transition period and introduces new faces and dynamics into the Belgian political landscape.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Senate\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件,要求详细全面\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election marked a significant political shift within the French-speaking constituencies, primarily Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region. A notable trend was the success of centre-right parties, particularly the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), which emerged as a dominant force in both regions <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nIn Wallonia, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) achieved a significant victory. The results indicated a clear win for right and centre-right parties, with MR securing 26 seats and Les Engagés (formerly CDH) obtaining 17 seats in the Walloon Parliament. This outcome enabled these two parties to quickly form a centre-right coalition government in the region <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>. The new Walloon Government, along with the French Community Government (also led by an MR-Les Engagés coalition), was formed by July 11, 2024, signaling a relatively swift transition driven by the electoral success of MR and Les Engagés and the electoral setback for the Socialist Party (PS) <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>. The MR party president, Georges-Louis Bouchez, interpreted the election results as a public desire for \"change and reform\" <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels-Capital Region:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region also witnessed a major political realignment among its French-speaking electorate. For the first time in 15 years, MR became the largest French-speaking party in the region. They secured just under 26% of the vote among French-speaking parties in Brussels, a significant increase from their 2019 score of 16.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>. Voters in Brussels have the unique option to vote for either French-speaking or Dutch-speaking party lists, with the French-speaking college being considerably larger, which is reflected in the seat distribution <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/EZ_eupinions_Belgium_the_War_and_the_Vote_02.2024.pdf</citation>. While MR saw overall success, local results varied; for instance, in the Anderlecht municipality of Brussels, the Belgian Worker's Party (PTB/PVDA) emerged as the most popular party, followed by the PS and then MR <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\n**Key French-speaking Parties and Dynamics:**\nSeveral parties play significant roles in the French-speaking political landscape:\n*   **Mouvement Réformateur (MR):** (Liberals) Emerged as the main victor in both Wallonia and Brussels, leading the new Walloon government with Les Engagés <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation> <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n*   **Parti Socialiste (PS):** (Social Democrats) Traditionally a dominant force, the PS experienced an electoral decline but remains a significant player, particularly at the local level in Brussels <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n*   **Les Engagés:** (Christian Democrats, formerly CDH) Partnered with MR to form the government in Wallonia and the French Community, marking a successful election for the rebranded party <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>.\n*   **Parti du Travail de Belgique (PTB/PVDA):** (Radical Left) This party, the only significant national party in Belgium, continued its breakthrough in the French-speaking community, showing strong performance in certain urban areas like Anderlecht <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160-with-the-radical-right-pushing-ahead-in-flanders-and-the-radical-left-in-wallonia-belgium-could-be-divided-after-the-elections</citation>.\n*   **Ecolo:** (Greens) Another key party in the French-speaking sphere <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n*   **DéFI (Démocrate Fédéraliste Indépendant):** A centrist party with a primary focus on Brussels <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-the-key-players-in-defi</citation> <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe election outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies indicated a shift towards the centre-right and a desire for political change, leading to new governing coalitions in Wallonia and a reshaped political hierarchy in Brussels.\n## Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls leading up to the 2024 Belgian federal election on June 9th indicated a shifting political landscape, marked by the rise of parties on the far-right and far-left, and a decline in support for several traditional mainstream parties. The overall picture suggested a potentially complex government formation process post-election.\n\n**General Trends**\nPolls consistently showed a weakening of traditional party families (liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats), who collectively garnered less than 50% of the vote in the 2019 elections for the first time since WWII <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. This trend appeared to continue, with more radical alternatives gaining traction. The far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) and the far-left Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB) both saw significant increases in support in polling compared to their 2019 results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. The Prime Minister's party, Open Vld, faced predictions of historically low results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Polling by Region**\n\n**Flanders:**\nIn Flanders, the political discourse was heavily influenced by issues of regional identity and immigration.\n*   The far-right, Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang (VB) consistently polled as one of the largest, if not the largest, party. An Ipsos poll from June 4, 2024, placed VB at 25.8% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Earlier polls in April 2024 also suggested VB would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), another right-leaning Flemish nationalist party, was typically the second-largest party in polls, with the June 4, 2024 Ipsos poll showing them at 21% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The socialist party Vooruit (formerly sp.a) had shown positive trends but saw a dip in support following controversies surrounding its former chairman, polling around 11-15% in 2024. The June 4th poll had Vooruit (VO) at 15.6% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The Christian Democrats (CD&V) were polling around 12.3% in early June 2024 <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PVDA) showed significant gains in Flanders, polling at 10.2% in early June 2024, nearly double its 2019 score <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Open Vld (OVLD), the Flemish liberal party of the Prime Minister, polled at 7%, a significant drop <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Groen (Flemish Greens) were at 6.1% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nWallonia, the French-speaking southern region, generally leaned more to the left.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) traditionally led in Wallonia. An Ipsos poll from May 20, 2024, showed PS at 22.6%, neck-and-neck with MR <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. An earlier Kantar poll from April 18, 2024, had PS leading more clearly at 25.4% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) was the second major force, polling at 22.6% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB, the francophone wing of PVDA) also showed strong support, polling at 14.5% (Ipsos, May 20) to 16% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Les Engagés (LE, formerly cdH, centrist) showed improvement, polling at 18.1% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Ecolo (Francophone Greens) were polling around 8.8% (Ipsos, May 20) to 12.7% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>, indicating a loss of support compared to previous elections <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual but largely French-speaking, presented a distinct political dynamic.\n*   Final opinion polls conducted between May 29-31, 2024, indicated that for federal voting intentions, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) held a \"healthy lead\" at 22.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. This was also reflected in earlier 2024 polls, such as an Ipsos poll from March 18, 2024, which placed MR at 21.8% in Brussels <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) was reported as \"tailing\" MR in the final May polls at 19.8%, representing a significant increase from their 2019 federal election result <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The March 18 Ipsos poll showed PVDA at 17.5% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) polled at 15.4% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Some later polls from PolitPro showed varying figures, with one May 20 Ipsos poll indicating Open VLD surprisingly high, which seemed to be an outlier compared to other data and analyses <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Ecolo, the francophone Greens, polled at 14.7% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**National Outlook and Seat Projections**\nWhile specific nationwide seat projections varied between pollsters, the LSE Europp blog in April 2024 noted that Vlaams Belang's projected support in Flanders could translate to approximately 25 seats in the 150-seat federal Chamber of Representatives, potentially making it the largest single party in parliament <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. An April 2023 poll analysis by The Brussels Times suggested that the then-current seven-party \"Vivaldi\" federal government coalition (PS, MR, Ecolo, Groen, CD&V, Open VLD, Vooruit) was projected to retain a slim majority of 81 seats, down from 87 in 2019 <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>. However, the declining fortunes of parties like Open Vld suggested that even if a similar coalition were mathematically possible, the internal dynamics would shift significantly <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\nThe rise of extremist parties (PVDA-PTB and Vlaams Belang), with whom most mainstream parties refused to govern (the \"cordon sanitaire\" against Vlaams Belang being a key factor), pointed towards another potentially lengthy and complicated government formation process <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n## Background\n\nBelgium's political system is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, characterized by a complex structure designed to accommodate its linguistic and cultural diversity <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation> <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>. The country is divided into three regions (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels-Capital) and three language communities (Flemish, French, and German-speaking). This division is deeply reflected in its political landscape, with most major political parties having distinct Flemish (Dutch-speaking) and Francophone (French-speaking) counterparts <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>. The King serves as the symbolic head of state, while actual executive power resides with the Prime Minister and the federal government <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation>. Historically, Belgium has undergone several state reforms, evolving into its current federal structure, to manage regional and linguistic tensions <citation>https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federale_staat</citation>. Coalition governments are the norm, often requiring lengthy negotiations among multiple parties to form a majority in the federal parliament. This system, sometimes referred to as a \"particracy,\" underscores the significant role of political parties in governance <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>.\n\nThe period leading up to the 2024 federal election was marked by significant political fragmentation. The previous federal government, a seven-party coalition known as the \"Vivaldi\" coalition led by Prime Minister Alexander De Croo (Open VLD), took 494 days to form following the May 2019 elections <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. The 2019 election had already highlighted a divided political landscape, with Flanders voting predominantly for right-leaning parties and Wallonia for left-leaning parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. Heading into 2024, there was widespread anticipation of a further shift to the right, particularly in Flanders with the rise of the far-right Vlaams Belang party in opinion polls <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation> <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation>. Increased political polarization was also a noted trend <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election was held on June 9, 2024, coinciding with the European Parliament elections and regional elections, making it a \"triple election\" day for Belgian voters <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation>. This election was significant as it was the first federal vote since the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also marked by one of the lowest voter turnouts recorded since compulsory voting was introduced in 1893, despite the legal obligation to vote <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. Key themes dominating the pre-election discourse included socio-economic issues, migration, the potential for further state reform, and the persistent challenge of forming stable governing coalitions in Belgium's complex political environment <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n## Preface\n\n比利时于2024年6月9日举行了联邦选举，这一天对比利时的政治格局具有重要意义 <citation>https://research.usfq.edu.ec/en/publications/the-2024-belgian-federal-elections-a-race-to-the-right</citation> <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/belgium-2024-election.html</citation>。此次联邦选举与欧洲议会选举和地区选举同日进行，构成了比利时政治日历中一个关键的“超级星期日” <citation>http://www.huashang.be/index/news/detail/id/401.html</citation> <citation>https://www.sohu.com/a/784917024_121124414</citation>。比利时以其复杂的多党制、语言社群的分立以及由此产生的联合政府而闻名，使得每一次联邦选举都备受关注 <citation>https://www.oushinet.com/static/content/international/guojinews/2023-12-28/1189974852875879752.html</citation>。\n\n本次选举是在一个充满挑战的背景下进行的，包括后疫情时代的经济复苏、地区间的持续张力以及欧洲整体政治风向的转变。选举结果不仅将决定未来联邦政府的组成，也将对国家未来的政策走向，乃至其在欧盟中的角色产生深远影响。部分观察家认为，2024年的选举可能成为比利时政治史上的一个“转折点” <citation>https://research.usfq.edu.ec/en/publications/the-2024-belgian-federal-elections-a-race-to-the-right</citation> <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>。本报告旨在全面回顾和分析2024年比利时联邦选举的背景、主要参与方、关键议题、选举结果及其对国家政治的潜在影响。\n## Retiring Incumbents and Departures\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election cycle saw a number of established political figures depart from parliament, either through retirement, resignation, or by not being re-elected. These departures often come with significant severance packages, which have been a subject of public discussion.\n\nSeveral long-serving and prominent politicians were among those leaving their parliamentary roles. For instance:\n*   **Patrick Dewael** (Open VLD), a former Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives, concluded a political career spanning 40 years. Upon his departure, he was eligible for a severance payment of €507,024 <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.\n*   **Maggie De Block** (Open VLD), a former Minister of Health, also announced her resignation. After her years of service, she was eligible for a severance payment of €316,000 <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.\n\nBeyond these specific figures, the election results led to a broader change in parliamentary composition. Reports indicated that a significant number of deputies would not be returning. For example, one source stated that 207 Belgian deputies lost their seats in the elections <citation>https://www.levif.be/belgique/politique/les-deputes-non-reelus-vont-ils-reellement-couter-36-millions-deuros-a-letat-belge-voici-comment-fonctionnent-les-indemnites-de-sortie/</citation>. In the Brussels regional parliament alone, eighteen outgoing deputies who stood for re-election were not successful <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/bruxelles-dix-huit-deputes-bruxellois-nont-pas-ete-reelus-dimanche/2024-06-10/article/678480</citation>.\n\nThe system of severance pay for departing parliamentarians, whether they retire or are not re-elected, has drawn attention. These payments are calculated based on years of service, with one year in parliament corresponding to roughly two months of gross salary. For a federal MP, this could mean around €21,000 per year of service <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>. Some estimates suggested that the total cost of these severance packages for deputies not re-elected could reach tens of millions of euros <citation>https://www.lecho.be/dossiers/elections-en-belgique/les-deputes-non-reelus-recevront-ensemble-20-millions-d-euros-d-indemnites-de-depart/10551367.html</citation> <citation>https://www.dhnet.be/actu/belgique/2024/07/04/jackpot-pour-les-deputes-sortants-certains-toucheront-une-plantureuse-pension-ainsi-quun-demi-million-deuros-WU65XHBJVBE5RDBIN2J24WBQO4/</citation>. This system is designed in part because MPs are not entitled to standard unemployment benefits. However, there is a cap for those elected after 2014, limiting severance to 24 months of salary <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.\n\nThe departure of experienced politicians, whether by choice or electoral outcome, marks a transition period and introduces new faces and dynamics into the Belgian political landscape.\n### 参议院\n\n2024年比利时联邦选举并未直接选举参议员。根据比利时宪法，参议院的组成方式有所不同。参议院由60名议员组成，其中50名参议员由社群和地区议会从其成员中任命，另外10名参议员由这50名议员根据联邦选举结果进行增选 <citation>https://www.senaat.be/www/?MIval=/index_senate&MENUID=51000&LANG=fr&PAGE=/event/20240422-elections2024/20240610-elections2024_fr.html</citation> <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/22/</citation> <citation>https://www.senate.be/english/SenateCompoEN.html</citation>。\n\n根据2024年6月9日的选举结果，新弗拉芒联盟（N-VA）成为参议院中最大的党派，拥有10个席位（包括任命和增选的参议员）<citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>。弗拉芒社会主义党Vooruit兑现了其不增选参议员的承诺 <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>。比利时工人党（PVDA/PTB）根据其在法语区的选举结果，可能会增选1名参议员 <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>。在60个参议院席位中，有59个将根据2024年6月9日的选举结果按比例分配给各政党 <citation>https://www.senate.be/event/20240422-elections2024/2024-renouvellement-Senat.pdf</citation>。\n\n值得注意的是，有组阁协议中提到了废除参议院的计划，但这需要联邦议会两院三分之二多数票的通过才能实现 <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BE/BE-LC01/election/BE-LC01-E20240609/</citation>。\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Electoral system\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

According to political analysts, the most obvious federal coalition would consist of the right-wing N-VA and MR, and centre-left Vooruit, with the centrist CD&V and Les Engagés parties to reach at least 76 seats.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: What are the dates of the elections in Belgium? - ONLZ\\nURL: https://www.onlz.com/en/blog/elections-belgium\\nCONTENT: Last Post Compsy 2025 Elections Recent Posts The Belgian municipal and provincial elections as well as the legislative, regional, community and European elections will take place in 2024.

When asked about the reasons behind the Workers' Party's breakthrough in the kingdom's French-speaking community since the previous general elections on 26 May 2019, Emilie van Haute, professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels, explains: \\\"The nature of the public debate is quite different: in Flanders, it is much more focused on migration issues, which is very favourable to Vlaams Belang, the party that has made these issues its main campaign theme.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections 2024: results and potential coalitions\\nURL: https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/\\nCONTENT: At federal level, Vivaldi II is unlikely: the outgoing centre-left “Vivaldi” coalition composed of socialists, liberals, greens (of both Dutch- and French-speaking parties) as well as CD&V (Dutch-speaking christian democrats, EPP) gathered a very narrow majority of 76 seats. In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix. On the opposite side, the right and centre-right parties harboured a landslide victory totalling 26 seats for MR and 17 seats for Les Engagés in the Walloon Parliament allowing both parties to form a centre-right coalition government.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: Elections in Belgium - Electiopedia\\nURL: https://electiopedia.com/elections-in-belgium/\\nCONTENT: Elections in Belgium – Electiopedia Facebook-f Twitter Linkedin Instagram Amazon Elections in Belgium Elections in Belgium Belgium operates as a federal parliamentary democracy and holds elections to determine its political representatives.

Passport\\n\\nProviding election data from around the world.\\n\\nBelgium\\n\\nBelgium has repeatedly tinkered with its electoral system over the past several decades.\\n\\nBELGIUM 1 (1991)\\nThis system may have also been used in previous elections.\\n\\nApportionment\\nHere is the apportionment of mandates within arrondissements (first tier) nested wtihin provinces (second tier) for 1978-91:\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst Allocation to Parties in Arrondissements\\nSeats were allocated first in arrondissements to parties for multiples of full Hare quotas (valid votes divided by the number of seats). Parties had to surpass a legal threshold of 5% of the arrondissement vote to qualify to receive any seats. Here is the 1991 allocation of seats in Dinant-Phillipeville and Namur Arrondissements of Namur Province:\\n\\nIn Dinant-Phillippeville, only the PS earned more votes than a full Hare quota (95,609 valid votes/3 seats equals a Hare quota of 31,690) and received a seat. In Namur Arrondissement, the PS gained more than 2 full Hare quotas (165,441 valid votes/6 seats equals a Hare quota of 27,574) and thus 2 seats. The PSC won a seat for exceeding more than 1 full Hare quota.\\n\\nSecond Allocation to Parties in Provinces\\nAfter allocation at the arrondissement level, any remaining seats were allocated at the provincial level based on the collective votes received by parties in all arrondissements according to the d’Hondt highest average method of proportional representation. Parties had to have received at least one-third of a Hare quota in at least one arrondissement to participate in the provincial level allocation. Here is the distribution of the remaining five seats in Namur Province in 1991:\\n\\nOnly four parties (PS, PSC, PRL, and ECOLO) received more than one-third of a Hare quota in at least one arrondissement (see previous table). The first d’Hondt quota is equal to the total number of votes received by each party. The quotas highlighted in yellow indicate the four seats already won by the PS and the PSC in the first level of allocation in the two arrondissements. The remaining seats were allocated in descending order of d’Hondt quotas as indicated by the numbers in boldface to the left of each quota.\\n\\nAllocation of Seats Won at the Provincial Level Back to Arrondissements\\nNote: I am uncertain regarding the accuracy of this part of the process. The next step is the allocation of the seats won at the provincial level back to each arrondissement. The calculation of local fractions for each party in each arrondissement that won seats at the provincial level facilitated this process. The local fraction equaled the number of seats won by the party in the arrondissement during the first allocation divided by the total number of Hare quotas that the party received in the arrondissement. The local fraction equaled 0 if the party won no seats in the arrondissement.\\n\\nThe rules for the allocation of seats won at the provincial level back to arrondissements appear to have been as follows. First, seats were allocated back to arrondissements in the order that they were won by the parties. Second, seats went to the arrondissement where the party had received a higher local fraction (or portion of a Hare quota if it had won no seats and the local fraction equaled zero). An exception is that if all of the seats in an arrondissement have already been filled, then the seat goes to the arrondissement with the next highest local fraction. Similarly, if a party has already received a provincially-won seat in an arrondissement, then its next provincially-won seat goes to the the arrondissement with the next highest local fraction.\\n\\nThe above table shows the order in which mandates were gained in Namur Province in 1991 and thus were allocated back to arrondissements. The previous table presents the local fractions greater than zero for all parties in the two arrondiseements in the province. The following table shows how the seats were allocated in this province back to arrondissements and the controlling rule. The fifth seat went to the PRL and to Namur Arrondissement as the PRL had won a higher remainder (i.e. portion of Hare quota) in that arrondissement. The sixth sent went to ECOLO in Namur following the same rule. The PSC had a higher local fraction in Dinant-Phillipeville, so it gained its seventh seat there. The PRL had already won a seat in Namur so it gained the eighth seat in Dinant-Phillipeville–the last seat in that arrondissement. The PS received the ninth and final seat in Namur where it had a higher local fraction but also the only seat left available.\\n\\nAllocation of Seats to Candidates\\nBelgian parties have to file ordered lists in each electoral constituency with no more names on the list than seats available. Voters may cast a vote for the list as ordered–called header votes–or preference votes for as many candidates as desired for their chosen party.\\n\\nCandidates need to have won preferences equal to a Droop quota–all valid ballots cast for the list divided by the number seats it won plus one (rounded up to the next whole number)–to gain a seat. Any candidates that exceed a Droop quota are elected (in descending order of the total number of preference votes received if there is more than one). If any seats remain, sufficient header votes are added to those preference votes received by other candidates so that they too can reach a Droop quota until all of the header votes have been devolved to candidates. Any seats still remaining are distributed based on the order of preference votes.\\n\\nThe following is a fictional example of the allocation process to candidates using these rules. (The names of candidates and preferences are for the New Flemish Alliance in Antwerp Province in 2014 but the allocation process was changed starting with the 2003 election.) In this case, the party won 11 of the 24 mandates.\\n\\nThe Droop quota equals 37,461 (rounded up result for 449,531 votes cast for the list divided by 12, which is one greater than number of seats won by the party). Only the leading candidate, Bart De Wever, exceeds the Droop quota and immediately wins a seat.\\n\\nAfterwards, one must begin the devolution of header votes to remaining candidates in list order. The Header Votes Devolution column shows how many are given to each candidate. The Header Votes Left column shows how many header votes are left as the devolution proceeds. The Preferences after Devolution column reveals the number of preferences for each candidate after the distribution of header votes is complete.\\n\\nThere were enough header votes for the second through fifth candidates on the list to reach full Droop quotas. Since all seats are not yet awarded, remaining seats go to candidates in order of preferences after the devolution of header votes. Rob van de Helde, the sixth on the list, wins election next as the devolution pushed his number of preference votes higher than Jan Jambon, who is last on the list. However, Jambon wins the seventh seat as he has the next highest number of preferences. The last four seats go in descending order of preferences–not in list order–as shown in the last column of the table.\\n\\nBELGIUM 2 (1995-99)\\nThe number of seats in the Chamber declined form 212 to 150 with the 1995 elections. Belgium also aggregated arrondissements together in several places to create larger first-tier electoral constituencies. Here was the apportionment for the 1995 and 1999 elections:\\n\\nThe final change was parties now needed to receive at least 2/3 of a Hare quota in one arrondissement to participate in the allocation of seats at the provincial level in that province.\\n\\nBELGIUM 3 (2003-2010)\\nBelgium simplified its electoral system for the 2003 elections. Leaving aside for the moment the now former province of Brabant, seats were allocated in a single allocation at the provincial level by the d’Hondt method.\\n\\nBrabant had been divided into three parts by the Belgian state reform: Flemish Brabant (part of Flanders), Walloon Barbant (part of Wallonia), and Brussels-Capital which was its own region separate from Flanders or Wallonia. However, the former constituencies and electoral system were maintained. So seats were first allocated for full Hare quotas in the three electoral districts–Leuven, Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde, and Walloon Brabant (Nivelles)–with seats then allocated by d’Hondt across former Brabant.\\n\\nHere is the apportionment for the 2003-2014 elections with the three linked constituencies in Brabant highlighted in yellow.\\n\\nAdditionally, Belgium altered the allocation of preference votes so that they became more likely to influence the order of the list. Specifically, the share of header votes devolved to candidates in list order was reduced from 100 to 50 percent.\\n\\nThe following shows the distribution of seats to candidates of the New Flemish Alliance in Antwerp Province in 2014 where the party won 11 of the 24 mandates. (Compare to the distribution under the old rules above.)\\n\\nThe Droop quota equaled 37,461 (rounded up result for 449,531 votes cast for the list divided by 12, which was one greater than number of seats won by the party). Only the leading candidate, Bart De Wever, exceeded the Droop quota and immediately won a seat.\\n\\nAfterwards, the devolution of header votes to remaining candidates began in list order.\\n\\nThere were enough header votes for the second and third candidates on the list to reach full Droop quotas. Since all seats were not yet awarded, remaining seats went to candidates in order of preferences after the devolution of header votes. Jan Jambon gained the fourth seat as he the most preference votes of any unreturned candidate, despite being placed last on the list. remaining seats go in descending order of preferences–not in list order–as shown in the last column of the table.\\n\\nBELGIUM 4 (2014)\\nBelgium altered the method for allocating seats in the former Province of Brabant starting with the 2014 election. There is no longer a second allocation tier.

This system allows the division of the seats among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparties in proportion to the results achieved.The pollsExcept for anticipated elections, members of the Chamber of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepresentatives and Senators are elected every 4 years.The European Parliament(*)and the community and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregional councils are elected every 5 years, the municipal and provincial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcouncils every 6 years.The ballot isobligatory and secret.In Belgium, going to the polling booth is compulsory.Valid are list votes, where the dot at the top of one political\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparty list is colored in. Also valid are preference votes or name votes, where\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton one list, dots are colored in next to the names of one or more individual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcandidates and/or replacement candidates. However, votes for different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolitical parties on one and the same ballot render the ballot invalid.Electoral districtsFor the elections of theChamber of representatives, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry is divided into 20 electoral districts. An electoral district\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorresponds to one or more administrative districts.The 150 Chamber seats are divided among the electoral districts\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to their number of population.For the election of the40 directly elected senators, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcountry is, like for the elections of the European Parliament, divided into 3\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telectoral districts : Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde.There are two electoral colleges : a Flemish one and a French one.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde, it is up to the citizen to decide to which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telectoral district he or she belongs, by voting for a Flemish or a French\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlanguage party.The Flemish electoral college elects 15 representatives.Repartition of seatsAccording to the D'Hondt method of calculation, the total number\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof ballots with votes for one single party in each electoral district is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivided successively by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc.This results in different electoral quotients per political\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart.Example of application of the D'Hondt systemAssuming that there are 12 seats to be assigned during an election\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand that there are 4 lists (A, B, C and D), 100 voters show up. Party A wins 40\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvotes, party B 30, party C 20 and party D 10.The obtained electoral quotients are then classified according to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsize until there are as many quotients as there are seats to be assigned. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlowest electoral quotient is the electoral divisor. Each list subsequently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceives as many seats as the number of times its voting number contains the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telectoral divisor.Total number of ballotsdivided byABCD140.030.020.010.0220.015.010.05.0313.310.06.63.3410.07.55.02.558.06.04.02.066.65.03.31.6The electoral divisor (= the lowest or 12th quotient eligible for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta seat) is 7,5.This gives party A 5 seats, party B receives 4 seats, party C 2\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand party D 1 seat.When the electoral divisor is the same for different parties (the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove case if there were only 7 seats to be assigned), the seat goes to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparty with the highest number of votes.In case two parties obtain the same number of votes, the seat goes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the individual candidate with the most name votes. If that number is equal,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe seat finally goes to the oldest candidate.Assignment of seats and name votesWhen each party knows the number of seats it obtained in each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telectoral district, the seats have to be assigned to individual candidates. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreference votes play an important role in this process.Are elected : the candidates who attain the eligibility number.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThis number is equal to the number of ballots containing votes for that party,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivided by the number of seats + 1 won by that party.The remaining votes are assigned to the candidates who did not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tachieve the number to be eligible according to their order on the list.The person at the bottom of the list has therefore only a small\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchance of being elected, unless he or she received enough preference votes to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tachieve the eligible number outright.*Belgium sends 14 Dutch speaking representatives,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t10 French speaking representatives, and one German speaking representative to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe European Parliament. |  | Population | those entitled to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t voteparliamentary election |  | 1831 | 4.080.000 | 46.000 | 1 % | 1848 | 4.359.000 | 79.000 | 2 % | 1894 | 6.342.000 | 1.355.000 | 21 % | 1919 | 7.577.000 | 1.761.000 | 23 % | 1949 | 8.526.000 | 5.031.000 | 59 % | 1981 | 9.849.000 | 6.877.000 | 70 % | 1995 | 10.131.000 | 7.199.000 | 71 % | 1999 | 10.128.000 | 7.305.000 | 72 % | 2003 | 10.310.000 | 7.571.000 | 75 % | 2007 | 10.585.000 | 7.721.000 | 73 % | 2010 | 10.840.000 | 7.768.000 | 72 % | Total number of ballotsdivided by | A | B | C | D | 1 | 40.0 | 30.0 | 20.0 | 10.0 | 2 | 20.0 | 15.0 | 10.0 | 5.0 | 3 | 13.3 | 10.0 | 6.6 | 3.3 | 4 | 10.0 | 7.5 | 5.0 | 2.5 | 5 | 8.0 | 6.0 | 4.0 | 2.0 | 6 | 6.6 | 5.0 | 3.3 | 1.6\\n | Population | those entitled to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t voteparliamentary election | \\n1831 | 4.080.000 | 46.000 | 1 %\\n1848 | 4.359.000 | 79.000 | 2 %\\n1894 | 6.342.000 | 1.355.000 | 21 %\\n1919 | 7.577.000 | 1.761.000 | 23 %\\n1949 | 8.526.000 | 5.031.000 | 59 %\\n1981 | 9.849.000 | 6.877.000 | 70 %\\n1995 | 10.131.000 | 7.199.000 | 71 %\\n1999 | 10.128.000 | 7.305.000 | 72 %\\n2003 | 10.310.000 | 7.571.000 | 75 %\\n2007 | 10.585.000 | 7.721.000 | 73 %\\n2010 | 10.840.000 | 7.768.000 | 72 %\\nTotal number of ballotsdivided by | A | B | C | D\\n1 | 40.0 | 30.0 | 20.0 | 10.0\\n2 | 20.0 | 15.0 | 10.0 | 5.0\\n3 | 13.3 | 10.0 | 6.6 | 3.3\\n4 | 10.0 | 7.5 | 5.0 | 2.5\\n5 | 8.0 | 6.0 | 4.0 | 2.0\\n6 | 6.6 | 5.0 | 3.3 | 1.6\\n\\nThe right to vote which was granted only to a privileged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tminority in 1830 was gradually expanded to all Belgian men and women from 18\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears of age.

        "value": "<answer>\n## Electoral system\n\nThe Belgian federal electoral system is a complex, multi-layered framework designed to ensure proportional representation across its diverse linguistic and regional communities. Key aspects of the system, particularly as they pertained to the 2024 federal election, are outlined below.\n\n**Parliamentary Structure:**\nBelgium has a bicameral Federal Parliament, consisting of:\n*   **The Chamber of Representatives (Volksvertegenwoordigers / Chambre des Représentants):** This is the lower house and the primary legislative body. It comprises 150 members directly elected by the population for a five-year term <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/22/</citation> <citation>https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federal_authorities/federal_parliament</citation>.\n*   **The Senate (Senaat / Sénat):** This is the upper house with a more limited legislative role. It has 60 members. Of these, 50 are appointed by the Parliaments of the Communities and the Regions from among their members, and the remaining 10 are co-opted by the Senate itself, also for a five-year term <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/22/</citation> <citation>https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federal_authorities/federal_parliament</citation>. The 2024 federal election directly concerned the election of members to the Chamber of Representatives.\n\n**Voting System:**\n*   **Proportional Representation:** Federal elections in Belgium utilize a system of proportional representation. This system aims to allocate seats to political parties in proportion to the number of votes they receive <citation>https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Elections_in_Belgium</citation>. This generally necessitates the formation of coalition governments, as it is rare for a single party to win an outright majority <citation>https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Elections_in_Belgium</citation>.\n*   **Flexible-List System:** For the Chamber of Representatives, a flexible-list proportional representation system is employed <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/22/</citation>. Under this system, voters can cast their vote in one of several ways:\n    *   Vote for a party list as a whole (a \"list vote\" or \"header vote\").\n    *   Vote for one or more specific candidates on a single party list (a \"preference vote\" or \"name vote\") <citation>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379418302877</citation> <citation>https://www.senate.be/english/LegElectionsEN.html</citation>.\n    Party votes generally go to the first candidate on the list until they have enough votes to be elected, after which the allocation can be influenced by the number of preference votes received by individual candidates <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>. The candidates' vote-earning capacity through preference votes is significant in determining who is elected <citation>https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96460-7_8</citation>.\n*   **D'Hondt Method:** The allocation of seats among parties is typically done using the D'Hondt method. This method involves dividing the total number of votes for each party by a series of divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) to determine quotients. Seats are then awarded to parties with the highest quotients until all seats are filled <citation>https://www.senate.be/english/LegElectionsEN.html</citation>.\n\n**Electoral Constituencies and Threshold:**\n*   **Electoral Districts:** For elections to the Chamber of Representatives, the country is divided into electoral districts, which generally correspond to the provinces. However, some specific arrangements exist, notably the division of Flemish Brabant into Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (BHV) and Leuven for electoral purposes in the past, though this has seen reforms <citation>https://www.primidi.com/belgian_chamber_of_representatives/members_and_elections</citation> <citation>https://www.electionpassport.com/electoral-systems/belgium/</citation>. For the 2024 election, there were 11 electoral districts <citation>https://www.primidi.com/belgian_chamber_of_representatives/members_and_elections</citation>.\n*   **Electoral Threshold:** Generally, there is a 5% electoral threshold in each constituency. Parties must achieve at least 5% of the vote in a constituency to be eligible for seat allocation in that district <citation>https://kids.kiddle.co/Chamber_of_Representatives_(Belgium)</citation> <citation>https://www.primidi.com/belgian_chamber_of_representatives/members_and_elections</citation>. However, there have been exceptions and legal challenges to this threshold in specific constituencies like Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde, Leuven, and Walloon Brabant in the past <citation>https://www.primidi.com/belgian_chamber_of_representatives/members_and_elections</citation>.\n\n**Voter Eligibility and Compulsory Voting:**\n*   **Voting Age:** Belgian citizens aged 18 and over have the right to vote in federal elections <citation>https://www.senate.be/english/LegElectionsEN.html</citation>. For the 2024 European elections, which were held concurrently, Belgium allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to vote, a change adopted in 2023 <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>.\n*   **Compulsory Voting:** Voting in federal elections is mandatory in Belgium <citation>https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Elections_in_Belgium</citation> <citation>https://www.senate.be/english/LegElectionsEN.html</citation>. This has historically resulted in very high turnout rates, although the 2024 elections reportedly saw one of the lowest turnouts since compulsory voting was introduced in 1893 <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\n**Election Timing:**\nFederal elections, along with regional and European Parliament elections, are generally organized simultaneously every five years <citation>https://be.brussels/en/about-region/elections-et-consultations-publiques/elections/federal-elections</citation>. The 2024 federal elections were held on June 9, 2024, concurrently with European and regional elections <citation>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391326019_The_2024_Belgian_federal_elections_a_race_to_the_right</citation>.\n\nThe Belgian electoral system reflects the country's federal structure and its commitment to representing its linguistic and political diversity, though its complexity often contributes to lengthy government formation processes.\n</answer>"

    "system": "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question. \\\nYou can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.\n\n## Tool Use Formatting\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Execute safe mathematical expressions.\\n\\nSupports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **) and common mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc.).\\nFor security reasons, only mathematical expressions are allowed, no arbitrary code execution.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Mathematical expression to calculate, e.g., \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\", \\\"sin(30 * pi / 180)\\\", \\\"sqrt(16)\\\"\"}}, \"required\": [\"expression\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n",

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件,要求详细全面\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election marked a significant political shift within the French-speaking constituencies, primarily Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region. A notable trend was the success of centre-right parties, particularly the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), which emerged as a dominant force in both regions <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nIn Wallonia, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) achieved a significant victory. The results indicated a clear win for right and centre-right parties, with MR securing 26 seats and Les Engagés (formerly CDH) obtaining 17 seats in the Walloon Parliament. This outcome enabled these two parties to quickly form a centre-right coalition government in the region <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>. The new Walloon Government, along with the French Community Government (also led by an MR-Les Engagés coalition), was formed by July 11, 2024, signaling a relatively swift transition driven by the electoral success of MR and Les Engagés and the electoral setback for the Socialist Party (PS) <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>. The MR party president, Georges-Louis Bouchez, interpreted the election results as a public desire for \"change and reform\" <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels-Capital Region:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region also witnessed a major political realignment among its French-speaking electorate. For the first time in 15 years, MR became the largest French-speaking party in the region. They secured just under 26% of the vote among French-speaking parties in Brussels, a significant increase from their 2019 score of 16.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>. Voters in Brussels have the unique option to vote for either French-speaking or Dutch-speaking party lists, with the French-speaking college being considerably larger, which is reflected in the seat distribution <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/EZ_eupinions_Belgium_the_War_and_the_Vote_02.2024.pdf</citation>. While MR saw overall success, local results varied; for instance, in the Anderlecht municipality of Brussels, the Belgian Worker's Party (PTB/PVDA) emerged as the most popular party, followed by the PS and then MR <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n\n**Key French-speaking Parties and Dynamics:**\nSeveral parties play significant roles in the French-speaking political landscape:\n*   **Mouvement Réformateur (MR):** (Liberals) Emerged as the main victor in both Wallonia and Brussels, leading the new Walloon government with Les Engagés <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation> <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n*   **Parti Socialiste (PS):** (Social Democrats) Traditionally a dominant force, the PS experienced an electoral decline but remains a significant player, particularly at the local level in Brussels <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation>.\n*   **Les Engagés:** (Christian Democrats, formerly CDH) Partnered with MR to form the government in Wallonia and the French Community, marking a successful election for the rebranded party <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1229472/100-days-after-belgiums-elections-where-are-we-now</citation>.\n*   **Parti du Travail de Belgique (PTB/PVDA):** (Radical Left) This party, the only significant national party in Belgium, continued its breakthrough in the French-speaking community, showing strong performance in certain urban areas like Anderlecht <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1086432/belgian-elections-2024-who-did-brussels-vote-for</citation> <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160-with-the-radical-right-pushing-ahead-in-flanders-and-the-radical-left-in-wallonia-belgium-could-be-divided-after-the-elections</citation>.\n*   **Ecolo:** (Greens) Another key party in the French-speaking sphere <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n*   **DéFI (Démocrate Fédéraliste Indépendant):** A centrist party with a primary focus on Brussels <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-the-key-players-in-defi</citation> <citation>https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DOWNLOAD-REPORT-ON-BELGIUM.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe election outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies indicated a shift towards the centre-right and a desire for political change, leading to new governing coalitions in Wallonia and a reshaped political hierarchy in Brussels.\n## Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls leading up to the 2024 Belgian federal election on June 9th indicated a shifting political landscape, marked by the rise of parties on the far-right and far-left, and a decline in support for several traditional mainstream parties. The overall picture suggested a potentially complex government formation process post-election.\n\n**General Trends**\nPolls consistently showed a weakening of traditional party families (liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats), who collectively garnered less than 50% of the vote in the 2019 elections for the first time since WWII <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. This trend appeared to continue, with more radical alternatives gaining traction. The far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) and the far-left Workers' Party of Belgium (PVDA-PTB) both saw significant increases in support in polling compared to their 2019 results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. The Prime Minister's party, Open Vld, faced predictions of historically low results <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Polling by Region**\n\n**Flanders:**\nIn Flanders, the political discourse was heavily influenced by issues of regional identity and immigration.\n*   The far-right, Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang (VB) consistently polled as one of the largest, if not the largest, party. An Ipsos poll from June 4, 2024, placed VB at 25.8% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Earlier polls in April 2024 also suggested VB would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), another right-leaning Flemish nationalist party, was typically the second-largest party in polls, with the June 4, 2024 Ipsos poll showing them at 21% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The socialist party Vooruit (formerly sp.a) had shown positive trends but saw a dip in support following controversies surrounding its former chairman, polling around 11-15% in 2024. The June 4th poll had Vooruit (VO) at 15.6% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   The Christian Democrats (CD&V) were polling around 12.3% in early June 2024 <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PVDA) showed significant gains in Flanders, polling at 10.2% in early June 2024, nearly double its 2019 score <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Open Vld (OVLD), the Flemish liberal party of the Prime Minister, polled at 7%, a significant drop <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Groen (Flemish Greens) were at 6.1% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**Wallonia:**\nWallonia, the French-speaking southern region, generally leaned more to the left.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) traditionally led in Wallonia. An Ipsos poll from May 20, 2024, showed PS at 22.6%, neck-and-neck with MR <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. An earlier Kantar poll from April 18, 2024, had PS leading more clearly at 25.4% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) was the second major force, polling at 22.6% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB, the francophone wing of PVDA) also showed strong support, polling at 14.5% (Ipsos, May 20) to 16% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Les Engagés (LE, formerly cdH, centrist) showed improvement, polling at 18.1% in the May 20 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   Ecolo (Francophone Greens) were polling around 8.8% (Ipsos, May 20) to 12.7% (Kantar, April 18) <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>, indicating a loss of support compared to previous elections <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\n**Brussels:**\nThe Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual but largely French-speaking, presented a distinct political dynamic.\n*   Final opinion polls conducted between May 29-31, 2024, indicated that for federal voting intentions, the Mouvement Réformateur (MR) held a \"healthy lead\" at 22.9% <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. This was also reflected in earlier 2024 polls, such as an Ipsos poll from March 18, 2024, which placed MR at 21.8% in Brussels <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) was reported as \"tailing\" MR in the final May polls at 19.8%, representing a significant increase from their 2019 federal election result <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1079133/belgium-braces-for-sundays-electoral-showdown-with-final-opinion-polls</citation>. The March 18 Ipsos poll showed PVDA at 17.5% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n*   The Socialist Party (PS) polled at 15.4% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>. Some later polls from PolitPro showed varying figures, with one May 20 Ipsos poll indicating Open VLD surprisingly high, which seemed to be an outlier compared to other data and analyses <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation> <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n*   Ecolo, the francophone Greens, polled at 14.7% in the March 18 Ipsos poll <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/2024</citation>.\n\n**National Outlook and Seat Projections**\nWhile specific nationwide seat projections varied between pollsters, the LSE Europp blog in April 2024 noted that Vlaams Belang's projected support in Flanders could translate to approximately 25 seats in the 150-seat federal Chamber of Representatives, potentially making it the largest single party in parliament <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>. An April 2023 poll analysis by The Brussels Times suggested that the then-current seven-party \"Vivaldi\" federal government coalition (PS, MR, Ecolo, Groen, CD&V, Open VLD, Vooruit) was projected to retain a slim majority of 81 seats, down from 87 in 2019 <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/440289/how-will-belgians-vote-at-the-2024-elections</citation>. However, the declining fortunes of parties like Open Vld suggested that even if a similar coalition were mathematically possible, the internal dynamics would shift significantly <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n\nThe rise of extremist parties (PVDA-PTB and Vlaams Belang), with whom most mainstream parties refused to govern (the \"cordon sanitaire\" against Vlaams Belang being a key factor), pointed towards another potentially lengthy and complicated government formation process <citation>https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/</citation>.\n## Background\n\nBelgium's political system is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, characterized by a complex structure designed to accommodate its linguistic and cultural diversity <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation> <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>. The country is divided into three regions (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels-Capital) and three language communities (Flemish, French, and German-speaking). This division is deeply reflected in its political landscape, with most major political parties having distinct Flemish (Dutch-speaking) and Francophone (French-speaking) counterparts <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>. The King serves as the symbolic head of state, while actual executive power resides with the Prime Minister and the federal government <citation>https://beentobelgium.com/belgian-government-politics/</citation>. Historically, Belgium has undergone several state reforms, evolving into its current federal structure, to manage regional and linguistic tensions <citation>https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federale_staat</citation>. Coalition governments are the norm, often requiring lengthy negotiations among multiple parties to form a majority in the federal parliament. This system, sometimes referred to as a \"particracy,\" underscores the significant role of political parties in governance <citation>https://www.best-country.com/en/europe/belgium/political_structure</citation>.\n\nThe period leading up to the 2024 federal election was marked by significant political fragmentation. The previous federal government, a seven-party coalition known as the \"Vivaldi\" coalition led by Prime Minister Alexander De Croo (Open VLD), took 494 days to form following the May 2019 elections <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. The 2019 election had already highlighted a divided political landscape, with Flanders voting predominantly for right-leaning parties and Wallonia for left-leaning parties <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/330182/belgian-politics-for-dummies-who-is-in-power-where</citation>. Heading into 2024, there was widespread anticipation of a further shift to the right, particularly in Flanders with the rise of the far-right Vlaams Belang party in opinion polls <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation> <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation>. Increased political polarization was also a noted trend <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election was held on June 9, 2024, coinciding with the European Parliament elections and regional elections, making it a \"triple election\" day for Belgian voters <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation>. This election was significant as it was the first federal vote since the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also marked by one of the lowest voter turnouts recorded since compulsory voting was introduced in 1893, despite the legal obligation to vote <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. Key themes dominating the pre-election discourse included socio-economic issues, migration, the potential for further state reform, and the persistent challenge of forming stable governing coalitions in Belgium's complex political environment <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n## Preface\n\n比利时于2024年6月9日举行了联邦选举，这一天对比利时的政治格局具有重要意义 <citation>https://research.usfq.edu.ec/en/publications/the-2024-belgian-federal-elections-a-race-to-the-right</citation> <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/world/europe/belgium-2024-election.html</citation>。此次联邦选举与欧洲议会选举和地区选举同日进行，构成了比利时政治日历中一个关键的“超级星期日” <citation>http://www.huashang.be/index/news/detail/id/401.html</citation> <citation>https://www.sohu.com/a/784917024_121124414</citation>。比利时以其复杂的多党制、语言社群的分立以及由此产生的联合政府而闻名，使得每一次联邦选举都备受关注 <citation>https://www.oushinet.com/static/content/international/guojinews/2023-12-28/1189974852875879752.html</citation>。\n\n本次选举是在一个充满挑战的背景下进行的，包括后疫情时代的经济复苏、地区间的持续张力以及欧洲整体政治风向的转变。选举结果不仅将决定未来联邦政府的组成，也将对国家未来的政策走向，乃至其在欧盟中的角色产生深远影响。部分观察家认为，2024年的选举可能成为比利时政治史上的一个“转折点” <citation>https://research.usfq.edu.ec/en/publications/the-2024-belgian-federal-elections-a-race-to-the-right</citation> <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>。本报告旨在全面回顾和分析2024年比利时联邦选举的背景、主要参与方、关键议题、选举结果及其对国家政治的潜在影响。\n## Retiring Incumbents and Departures\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election cycle saw a number of established political figures depart from parliament, either through retirement, resignation, or by not being re-elected. These departures often come with significant severance packages, which have been a subject of public discussion.\n\nSeveral long-serving and prominent politicians were among those leaving their parliamentary roles. For instance:\n*   **Patrick Dewael** (Open VLD), a former Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives, concluded a political career spanning 40 years. Upon his departure, he was eligible for a severance payment of €507,024 <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.\n*   **Maggie De Block** (Open VLD), a former Minister of Health, also announced her resignation. After her years of service, she was eligible for a severance payment of €316,000 <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.\n\nBeyond these specific figures, the election results led to a broader change in parliamentary composition. Reports indicated that a significant number of deputies would not be returning. For example, one source stated that 207 Belgian deputies lost their seats in the elections <citation>https://www.levif.be/belgique/politique/les-deputes-non-reelus-vont-ils-reellement-couter-36-millions-deuros-a-letat-belge-voici-comment-fonctionnent-les-indemnites-de-sortie/</citation>. In the Brussels regional parliament alone, eighteen outgoing deputies who stood for re-election were not successful <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/bruxelles-dix-huit-deputes-bruxellois-nont-pas-ete-reelus-dimanche/2024-06-10/article/678480</citation>.\n\nThe system of severance pay for departing parliamentarians, whether they retire or are not re-elected, has drawn attention. These payments are calculated based on years of service, with one year in parliament corresponding to roughly two months of gross salary. For a federal MP, this could mean around €21,000 per year of service <citation>https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/politique/la-composition-des-parlements-va-changer-combien-selevent-les-indemnites-de/2024-06-12/article/679300</citation>.

Key aspects of the system, particularly as they pertained to the 2024 federal election, are outlined below.\n\n**Parliamentary Structure:**\nBelgium has a bicameral Federal Parliament, consisting of:\n*   **The Chamber of Representatives (Volksvertegenwoordigers / Chambre des Représentants):** This is the lower house and the primary legislative body. It comprises 150 members directly elected by the population for a five-year term <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/22/</citation> <citation>https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federal_authorities/federal_parliament</citation>.\n*   **The Senate (Senaat / Sénat):** This is the upper house with a more limited legislative role. It has 60 members. Of these, 50 are appointed by the Parliaments of the Communities and the Regions from among their members, and the remaining 10 are co-opted by the Senate itself, also for a five-year term <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/22/</citation> <citation>https://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federal_authorities/federal_parliament</citation>. The 2024 federal election directly concerned the election of members to the Chamber of Representatives.\n\n**Voting System:**\n*   **Proportional Representation:** Federal elections in Belgium utilize a system of proportional representation. This system aims to allocate seats to political parties in proportion to the number of votes they receive <citation>https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Elections_in_Belgium</citation>. This generally necessitates the formation of coalition governments, as it is rare for a single party to win an outright majority <citation>https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Elections_in_Belgium</citation>.\n*   **Flexible-List System:** For the Chamber of Representatives, a flexible-list proportional representation system is employed <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/22/</citation>. Under this system, voters can cast their vote in one of several ways:\n    *   Vote for a party list as a whole (a \"list vote\" or \"header vote\").\n    *   Vote for one or more specific candidates on a single party list (a \"preference vote\" or \"name vote\") <citation>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379418302877</citation> <citation>https://www.senate.be/english/LegElectionsEN.html</citation>.\n    Party votes generally go to the first candidate on the list until they have enough votes to be elected, after which the allocation can be influenced by the number of preference votes received by individual candidates <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>. The candidates' vote-earning capacity through preference votes is significant in determining who is elected <citation>https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96460-7_8</citation>.\n*   **D'Hondt Method:** The allocation of seats among parties is typically done using the D'Hondt method. This method involves dividing the total number of votes for each party by a series of divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) to determine quotients. Seats are then awarded to parties with the highest quotients until all seats are filled <citation>https://www.senate.be/english/LegElectionsEN.html</citation>.\n\n**Electoral Constituencies and Threshold:**\n*   **Electoral Districts:** For elections to the Chamber of Representatives, the country is divided into electoral districts, which generally correspond to the provinces. However, some specific arrangements exist, notably the division of Flemish Brabant into Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (BHV) and Leuven for electoral purposes in the past, though this has seen reforms <citation>https://www.primidi.com/belgian_chamber_of_representatives/members_and_elections</citation> <citation>https://www.electionpassport.com/electoral-systems/belgium/</citation>. For the 2024 election, there were 11 electoral districts <citation>https://www.primidi.com/belgian_chamber_of_representatives/members_and_elections</citation>.\n*   **Electoral Threshold:** Generally, there is a 5% electoral threshold in each constituency. Parties must achieve at least 5% of the vote in a constituency to be eligible for seat allocation in that district <citation>https://kids.kiddle.co/Chamber_of_Representatives_(Belgium)</citation> <citation>https://www.primidi.com/belgian_chamber_of_representatives/members_and_elections</citation>. However, there have been exceptions and legal challenges to this threshold in specific constituencies like Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde, Leuven, and Walloon Brabant in the past <citation>https://www.primidi.com/belgian_chamber_of_representatives/members_and_elections</citation>.\n\n**Voter Eligibility and Compulsory Voting:**\n*   **Voting Age:** Belgian citizens aged 18 and over have the right to vote in federal elections <citation>https://www.senate.be/english/LegElectionsEN.html</citation>. For the 2024 European elections, which were held concurrently, Belgium allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to vote, a change adopted in 2023 <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>.\n*   **Compulsory Voting:** Voting in federal elections is mandatory in Belgium <citation>https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Elections_in_Belgium</citation> <citation>https://www.senate.be/english/LegElectionsEN.html</citation>. This has historically resulted in very high turnout rates, although the 2024 elections reportedly saw one of the lowest turnouts since compulsory voting was introduced in 1893 <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\n**Election Timing:**\nFederal elections, along with regional and European Parliament elections, are generally organized simultaneously every five years <citation>https://be.brussels/en/about-region/elections-et-consultations-publiques/elections/federal-elections</citation>. The 2024 federal elections were held on June 9, 2024, concurrently with European and regional elections <citation>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391326019_The_2024_Belgian_federal_elections_a_race_to_the_right</citation>.\n\nThe Belgian electoral system reflects the country's federal structure and its commitment to representing its linguistic and political diversity, though its complexity often contributes to lengthy government formation processes.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Aftermath\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

Rousseau has argued that, as the only left-leaning party, Vooruit cannot agree to a coalition that prioritises conservative fiscal reforms and tax cuts, fearing these measures would compromise social security and pensions.

In case Open VLD decides to join a government anyway to reach a majority, there could be a revival of the 2014-2019 centre-right “Swedish” coalition composed of the N-VA, CD&V, Open VLD and MR adding Les Engagés into the mix.

De Croo handed over his resignation as prime minister to the country’s King Philippe, a procedural step after which the king meets with leaders of Belgium’s biggest parties: N-VA’s De Wever first, Vlaams Belang’s Tom Van Grieken second and MR’s Bouchez third.

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: At Last, a Government: New Belgian Coalition Ponders Reforms\\nURL: https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/\\nCONTENT: Consolidated federal finances and tighter immigration policies take priority over Flemish self-government for the ideologically diverse coalition.

In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. As a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: 2024 Belgian federal election government formation\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: What's the latest on Belgium's Federal Government formation?\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/1132172/whats-the-latest-on-belgiums-federal-government-formation\\nCONTENT: Since the elections of 9 June, De Wever has been trying (first as an \\\"informator\\\" and for the last two weeks as \\\"preformator\\\") to form a Federal Government.

As per constitutional tradition, King Philippe commenced consultations with the leaders of the major political parties to navigate the formation of a new government. Bart De Wever, leader of the Flemish nationalist party N-VA, which emerged as a dominant force particularly in Flanders and secured the most seats overall, was appointed as \"informator\" and subsequently as \"preformator\" or \"formateur\" to spearhead the challenging coalition talks <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1087862/elections-aftermath-live-king-receives-more-visits-talks-start-on-flemish-government-tbtb</citation> <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1132172/whats-the-latest-on-belgiums-federal-government-formation</citation>.\n\nThe election results signaled a notable turn to the right in Belgian politics. The N-VA and the Francophone liberal Mouvement Réformateur (MR) were widely regarded as the primary victors <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>. While the far-right Vlaams Belang party also saw an increase in its vote share and seat count, it did not succeed in its ambition to become the largest party in Flanders, with N-VA maintaining its leading position in the region <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation> <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-far-right-election-extremist-landslide-elections-in-europe-results-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe path to forming a federal government proved to be arduous and lengthy. Bart De Wever pursued the formation of a so-called \"Arizona\" coalition, envisioned to include his N-VA, the Christian Democratic CD&V, and the socialist Vooruit from the Flemish side, along with the liberal MR and the centrist Les Engagés from the Francophone camp <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1132172/whats-the-latest-on-belgiums-federal-government-formation</citation>. These negotiations were fraught with difficulties. Deep divisions emerged, particularly concerning proposed conservative fiscal reforms and tax cuts, which led Vooruit to express concerns about the potential impact on social security and pensions <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-belgiums-federal-government-crisis-deepens-as-possible-coalition-nears-collapse</citation>. Furthermore, the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), having experienced electoral setbacks, announced its decision to enter opposition, further complicating the coalition arithmetic <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-belgiums-federal-government-crisis-deepens-as-possible-coalition-nears-collapse</citation>. The talks experienced several breakdowns; notably, on November 4, 2024, De Wever's efforts faced a major setback when Vooruit withdrew its support for a right-leaning government <citation>https://brusselssignal.eu/2024/11/belgian-federal-government-talks-collapse-again/</citation>. Earlier reports around August 2024 also indicated De Wever had resigned as \"formateur,\" underscoring the persistent challenges <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/08/23/talks-on-the-formation-of-a-federal-government-what-now/</citation>.\n\nIn stark contrast to the federal complexities, the political situation in Wallonia saw a quicker resolution. A regional government was formed by MR and Les Engagés, reflecting the centre-right momentum in the French-speaking part of the country <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1087862/elections-aftermath-live-king-receives-more-visits-talks-start-on-flemish-government-tbtb</citation> <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nAfter nearly eight months of intense negotiations and political maneuvering, a new federal government was finally established. On February 3, 2025, the \"Arizona\" coalition government was sworn in, with Bart De Wever (N-VA) assuming the office of Prime Minister <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1424985/whos-in-belgiums-new-federal-government</citation>. The new federal cabinet consists of the Prime Minister and 14 ministers, with a linguistic balance of seven Francophone and six Dutch-speaking ministers, alongside the Dutch-speaking premier <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1424985/whos-in-belgiums-new-federal-government</citation>. The coalition is understood to comprise N-VA, CD&V, and Vooruit from Flanders, and MR and Les Engagés from the Francophone side <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1132172/whats-the-latest-on-belgiums-federal-government-formation</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1424985/whos-in-belgiums-new-federal-government</citation>. Key policy priorities anticipated for the new administration include consolidating federal finances and implementing stricter immigration policies, while N-VA's traditional demands for extensive Flemish self-government appeared to be less prominent in the initial government program <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n\nAnother significant aspect of the 2024 elections was the historically low voter turnout, one of the lowest recorded since the introduction of compulsory voting in Belgium in 1893, marking the election as a noteworthy event in the nation's political landscape <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n</answer>"

Forming Belgian federal coalitions has been challenging in the last two decades due to profound ideological differences between political parties from Dutch-speaking Flanders and Francophone parties from Wallonia and the capital region of Brussels, which is officially bilingual.\\nTraditionally, Flemings tend to vote for rightwing parties, in support of lower taxation and tougher crime and migration policy. In June 2024, however, the right wing gained ground also in Francophone Belgium. In a surprise to pollsters, the left-wing parties —socialists, communists, and greens—suffered a collective defeat. George-Louis Bouchez, the leader of the centre-right Francophone liberals, managed to become the dominant political force and concluded a regional Walloon coalition with the centrist party Les Engages, thereby also committing to joining a federal coalition together.\\nIn Flanders, the centre-right N-VA, led by Antwerp mayor Bart De Wever, equally surprised pollsters by managing to remain the biggest Flemish party ahead of the right-wing populist Vlaams Belang, kept out of government with a cordon sanitaire imposed by all other political parties.\\nDe Wever’s Flemish centre-right nationalist N-VA is now governing in coalition with Francophone liberals and centrists, as well as Flemish Christian democrats and social democrats, The arrangement has been dubbed an “Arizona” coalition, mirroring the colors of the  flag of the American state: yellow for N-VA, orange for Christian democrats, red for socialists, and blue for Francophone liberals and centrists.\\nIn the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. De Wever once quipped, “From treason to treason, we achieve Flemish statehood,” mocking those in Flemish nationalist circles who view any concession as unacceptable.\\nDuring the election campaign, De Wever emphasized that consolidating Belgium’s public finances should be the top priority for the Flemish region, which accounts for about 80% of Belgian exports with only 60% of the population. The outgoing federal government, dominated by socialists and greens, left a massive budget hole, along with other irresponsible policies, such as the closure of perfectly functional nuclear power plants, despite the 2022 energy crisis.\\nThe new government programme includes a number of measures that should help consolidate the budget. All in all, the reforms are quite modest, given how a majority was only possible by including the Flemish socialist party and the left-leaning Flemish Christian Democrats. A key measure is that citizens will need to work slightly longer before being able to enjoy a full state pension. Belgian taxes on salaries—the highest in the world—will be slightly reduced. The centre-right parties had to concede the introduction of a general capital gains tax—pretty much the only tax that did not yet exist in the world’s most heavily taxed country. Furthermore, it will no longer be possible to enjoy unemployment benefits indefinitely. Belgium was one of the only countries in the world offering this arrangement.\\nThe hope is that these measures will drastically reduce the high number of working-age people who are currently not employed. This is a challenge especially in the Francophone part of the country, something De Wever has cited to argue that at least some of his policies align with his regionalist beliefs. He is not wrong. Without the Francophone socialist party—which has been blocking these sensible reforms for years—it has now become possible to introduce these measures.\\nWhen it comes to immigration policy, Belgium is about to tighten things up by no longer providing private housing to asylum seekers, but instead collective reception centers. Asylum seekers who have already been rejected by another EU country won’t be able to enjoy housing if there is a shortage. Family reunification will be limited by increasing the income threshold and requiring a language and citizenship test. The new government will also explore sending illegal immigrants who commit crimes to serve their sentences in prisons abroad. Notably, it will also unify the six police zones in Brussels into a single one, against the resistance of the 19 Brussels mayors, who are wary of losing power.\\nObservers are skeptical whether these policies will suffice to plug Belgium’s budget deficit, which, at almost 5%, is among the biggest in the Western world. In any case, PM De Wever still wants Belgium to become a “confederation.” Before the 2024 election, he even stated that if this worked well, to him, Flemish independence was no longer necessary. The government agreement includes little in this area, only committing to ongoing exploration of institutional reforms. A two-thirds majority in the Belgian Lower House is required to pass such reforms, but financial pressure could potentially help achieve these numbers over time.\\nThe Brussels region, which is struggling to form a new government, has a whopping 40 percent budget deficit. State-owned bank Belfius has warned the Walloon region it may cease refinancing, having already refused to finance several Walloon cities. The Flemish region, meanwhile, seems to be swimming in cash, as it is able to spend a massive €18 billion on subsidies.\\nAs a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\\nThe obvious solution would be to transfer competences like health care and pensions from the federal level to the regional entities—this is more or less the case in Spain and Germany—without fully transferring the budgets for this. Something along these lines already happened with the sixth big institutional reform in Belgium, passed fifteen years ago, but only for a select number of competences.\\nIf repeated on a large scale, the Flemish government would be forced to cut subsidies in order to finance its newly acquired competences. The already virtually bankrupt Francophone regional entities would then get new resources to pay for their new competences, dependent on implementing an—IMF or the euro zone Troika style—adjustment programme. It is not hard to see why Belgium’s political class is keen to postpone something like this for as long as possible, but at some point, the pressure may become too big.\\nIdeally, at the heart of future Belgian institutional reform would be to grant every policy level the taxation power required to finance whatever is within its competences. This would send the right incentives throughout the system, as politicians would know that every spending decision will also carry a requirement to impose taxes. The great model for this is Switzerland. In no other country, decentralised entities enjoy more taxing power than over there. In countries where decentralisation is only a sham, such as the UK, decentralised policy levels are mainly allowed to spend money they get from the central authority. Typically, the central authority resists giving up taxation power.\\nPieter Cleppe is the editor-in-chief of BrusselsReport.eu, an online magazine covering EU politics.

It will push Belgium into a precarious situation with few viable alternatives remaining.\\n\\nAfter the 9 June elections, many Belgians kept their hopes up for a quick federal government formation. With the right-wing N-VA, led by De Wever, emerging as the winner in Flanders and the liberal MR dethroning the socialists in Wallonia, a coalition was, according to many observers, within reach. However, the centre-right alliance De Wever tried to form - involving his own party, Les Engagés, MR, the Christian Democratic CD&V and the socialist Vooruit party - has been facing insurmountable friction over the past few weeks.\\n\\nSocialist resistance\\n\\nConner Rousseau, chairman of Vooruit, has become the key obstacle, openly rejecting the proposed framework. Rousseau has argued that, as the only left-leaning party, Vooruit cannot agree to a coalition that prioritises conservative fiscal reforms and tax cuts, fearing these measures would compromise social security and pensions.\\n\\nDe Wever’s efforts to mediate fell short, even after multiple revisions to the coalition’s “super memo,” a comprehensive draft designed to appeal across party lines. Rousseau remained unmoved, to the frustration of other party leaders such as Maxime Prévot of Les Engagés.\\n\\nOptions\\n\\nAs De Wever prepares to inform the king on Monday, speculation mounts over what could follow. Alternatives to the intended coalition are bleak. The Flemish liberals (Open VLD) could replace Vooruit, which might ease ideological tensions but would leave the coalition with a razor-thin and possibly unworkable majority. Other options would require Wallonia’s socialists to get aboard, but PS chairman Paul Magnette is adamant about staying out of government after his party’s losses in the last elections.\\n\\nEach scenario thus appears increasingly unviable, leaving the king with limited choices. If the current negotiating parties cannot overcome their differences, it seems unlikely that the current deadlock will be resolved. A crisis like in 2010-11, when Belgium needed a record 541 days to form a federal government, might be looming.\\n\\n\\n\\nFormateur Bart De Wever © BELGA PHOTO NICOLAS MAETERLINCK\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\nGet updates in your mailbox\\n\\nBy clicking \\\"Subscribe\\\" I confirm I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy.\\n\\nAbout belganewsagency.eu\\n\\nBelga News Agency delivers dependable, rapid and high-quality information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from Belgium and abroad to all Belgian media.

Credit: Belga/Nicolas Maeterlinck\\nAs the Flemish socialist party Vooruit agreed to give the talks to form the Federal Government \\\"a fair chance\\\" following a meeting on Tuesday, preformator and leader of the rightwing N-VA Bart De Wever will likely be appointed as official \\\"formator\\\" on Wednesday.\\nSince the elections of 9 June, De Wever has been trying (first as an \\\"informator\\\" and for the last two weeks as \\\"preformator\\\") to form a Federal Government. On the Flemish side this would involve his N-VA party, Vooruit and centrist CD&V on the Francophone side it would include the liberal MR and centrist Les Engagés parties.\\nThis coalition would reflect the regional government formations: N-VA, CD&V and Vooruit in Flanders; MR and Les Engagés in Wallonia. Both regions are currently carrying out intense negotiations.\\nCompromise and red lines\\nWhile very little information about the federal formation talks with De Wever is leaking to the press, a source told Belga News Agency that discussions are constructive, with De Wever making efforts to attend to the demands and red lines of all involved parties.\\nHowever, in recent weeks Vooruit has put the brakes on negotiations. As the only party of the left (without the support of its French-speaking sister party PS), Vooruit finds itself alone among centre-right partners. It would face PS, the Greens and the radical left PTB-PVDA in opposition.\\nVooruit has insisted on guarantees that no cuts will be made to the healthcare sector and protections for the purchasing power of working people. It is also pushing to ensure that those with greater financial security contribute more to State finances.\\nWhile the party leaders of the envisaged coalition have been meeting for informal information sessions over the past week, Tuesday's meeting aimed to convince the Flemish socialists to give the go-ahead, allowing full-fledged government negotiations to proceed.\\nFollowing the meeting with De Wever, Vooruit's Conner Rousseau said that \\\"an objective shift\\\" had happened, which is why the party is now ready to give the negotiations a fair chance. \\\"The party has given us the confidence for a best-efforts commitment,\\\" he explained. In other words, if things go the wrong way during the negotiations, Vooruit can still leave the table.\\nN-VA leader Bart De Wever talks to the press during the post-election meeting. Credit: Belga / Nicolas Maeterlinck\\nJan Jambon (one of N-VA negotiators) believes there is a chance that De Wever can officially start forming the government from Wednesday. \\\"I think it is doable,\\\" Jambon told reporters before the talks on Tuesday afternoon. \\\"It is a crucial moment now. I hope that every party is willing to negotiate because the country needs a government.\\\"\\nOther party leaders were also positive after the meeting. MR leader Georges-Louis Bouchez said there is more agreement between the parties currently negotiating than there were for the previous \\\"Vivaldi\\\" Federal Government. \\\"In terms of security, migration and even the labour market, they can do more with us than with the PS and the Greens. There are enough elements to move forward.\\\"\\nParty leader of Les Engagés Maxime Prévot said that his party \\\"fully agrees\\\" to start negotiations now: \\\"We are ready to form a new government as quickly as possible.\\\"\\nFormator?\\nCD&V leader Sammy Mahdi said that Tuesday's meeting was a \\\"good conversation\\\", adding that \\\"there was a constructive attitude in the room\\\". He said that all parties were eager not to go around in circles.\\nCD&V is satisfied with De Wever's concessions in the negotiations: \\\"Our priorities – fiscal reform and healthcare – have been sufficiently taken into account. We have an opportunity to do great things.\\\"\\nPreformator De Wever is expected at the Royal Palace at 10:00 on Wednesday. Now Vooruit indicated that negotiations can start, he could possibly leave his meeting with the King as formator – meaning he can officially start leading the negotiations for the coalition agreement. Should that be the case, it becomes increasingly likely that De Wever will also become Prime Minister.\\nRelated News\\n\\nThe federal coalition should be established before July 21, says Reynders\\n'Severe' cuts to Belgian healthcare budget divide government formations\\nN-VA's De Wever meets with all five parties to form Federal Government\\n\\n\\n331 top jobs in Belgium\\nResearch Associate II - NumetaBaxter InternationalProject & Events OfficerEBF - European Banking FederationCommunications TraineeLRE FoundationResearch & Innovation Project Officer (2 positions)IFOAM Organics EuropeDrupal ExpertEuropean Dynamics\\nSee all jobs Post a job\\nLatest News\\n\\nReal estate company Ghelamco lost over €320 million in 2024\\n\\nEast Flanders votes to ban headscarves from schools\\n\\nTwelve EU member States request extra room for defence spending\\n\\nPriority for Brussels tenants to buy homes up for sale\\n\\nPS leader calls for resistance to 'an increasingly radical' right wing\\n\\nIndia closes its airspace to Pakistani planes\\n\\nThis year's Baillet Latour Biomedical Award goes to ULiège's Coraline Radermecker\\n\\nAudit launched into budget overrun at express railway project\\n\\nChina lifts sanctions against European Parliament members\\n\\nAudi Brussels appoints broker for sale of Forest site\\n\\nVilvoorde-Machelen police zone to deploy drones\\n\\nDe Wever to visit the Netherlands next week\\n\\nFormer Liège footballer sentenced for rape\\n\\nArmed robbery at jewellery store in Brussels - suspect at large\\nLoad more\\nCopyright © 2025 The Brussels Times.

The King then commenced consultations with leaders of the major parties, including Bart De Wever of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), Tom Van Grieken of the far-right Vlaams Belang, and Georges-Louis Bouchez of the Francophone liberal Reformist Movement (MR) <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>. The election results signaled a \"race to the right\" <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The N-VA maintained its position as the largest party in Flanders, while MR emerged as a dominant force in Wallonia. Vlaams Belang saw an increase in its vote share but failed to overtake N-VA and remained isolated by the \"cordon sanitaire\" – an agreement among other parties not to govern with them <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation> <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>. Notably, the election recorded one of the lowest voter turnouts since the introduction of compulsory voting in 1893 <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\n**A Lengthy and Arduous Path to Government Formation**\nBart De Wever (N-VA) was appointed by the King, first as \"informateur\" and subsequently as \"formateur,\" to lead the complex task of building a federal government coalition <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1132172/whats-the-latest-on-belgiums-federal-government-formation</citation>. The process proved to be exceptionally challenging, extending for 236 days, or nearly eight months <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation> <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1424985/whos-in-belgiums-new-federal-government</citation>. Negotiations for the proposed \"Arizona\" coalition – comprising N-VA, the Christian Democratic CD&V, and the socialist Vooruit from Flanders, with MR and the centrist Les Engagés from Wallonia – faced considerable friction. A key sticking point was the reluctance of Vooruit, as the sole left-leaning party in the potential coalition, to agree to conservative fiscal reforms and tax cuts, fearing negative impacts on social security and pensions <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-belgiums-federal-government-crisis-deepens-as-possible-coalition-nears-collapse</citation>.\nTalks reached a critical impasse around November 4, 2024, when Vooruit, under leader Conner Rousseau, effectively rejected the proposed framework for a right-leaning government. This led De Wever to offer his resignation as formateur to the King, who initially postponed its acceptance, allowing a final window for a breakthrough <citation>https://brusselssignal.eu/2024/11/belgian-federal-government-talks-collapse-again/</citation> <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-belgiums-federal-government-crisis-deepens-as-possible-coalition-nears-collapse</citation>. The Francophone Socialist Party (PS), having suffered significant losses, had already declared its intention to remain in opposition <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-belgiums-federal-government-crisis-deepens-as-possible-coalition-nears-collapse</citation>.\n\n**The \"Arizona\" Coalition Takes Office**\nEventually, an agreement was reached, and the new \"Arizona\" federal government was sworn in on February 3, 2025 <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1424985/whos-in-belgiums-new-federal-government</citation> <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>. Bart De Wever (N-VA) assumed the role of Prime Minister, leading a cabinet of 14 ministers (seven Francophone and six Dutch-speaking) in addition to himself, with no state secretaries appointed <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1424985/whos-in-belgiums-new-federal-government</citation>.\nThe new government's program prioritizes consolidating Belgium’s public finances, which faced a deficit of nearly 5% <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>. Other key policy areas include implementing tighter immigration measures, such as shifting from private housing to collective reception centers for asylum seekers and limiting family reunification. Modest socio-economic reforms are also planned, including a slight increase in the working age for a full state pension, a reduction in taxes on salaries, the introduction of a capital gains tax, and the cessation of indefinite unemployment benefits <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>. Despite N-VA's Flemish nationalist origins, the immediate government program placed less emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, focusing instead on fiscal consolidation <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation> <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\n**Broader Implications and Regional Dynamics**\nThe election results and subsequent federal government formation also shaped regional politics. In Flanders, a coalition of N-VA, CD&V, and Vooruit took power, while Wallonia saw a centre-right government formed by MR and Les Engagés, mirroring the federal arrangement <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1132172/whats-the-latest-on-belgiums-federal-government-formation</citation> <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>. Despite the formation of a new government, observers remain skeptical about whether the outlined policies will be sufficient to resolve Belgium's substantial budget deficit. The underlying financial pressures may yet necessitate more extensive institutional reforms in the future <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n</answer>"

The election results confirmed a move to the right, with the Flemish right-wing New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) remaining the largest party in Flanders and the Francophone liberal Reformist Movement (MR) emerging as a major victor in Wallonia <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation> <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>. The far-right Vlaams Belang also gained seats but did not overtake N-VA, with the \"cordon sanitaire\" preventing its inclusion in government talks <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected/</citation> <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n\nKing Philippe began consultations with party leaders, appointing N-VA leader Bart De Wever first as \"informator\" and subsequently as \"preformator\" to explore potential coalition options <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1132172/whats-the-latest-on-belgiums-federal-government-formation</citation>. The focus quickly turned to forming a so-called \"Arizona\" coalition, named for the colors of the US state's flag, which would involve N-VA, the Christian Democratic CD&V, and the socialist Vooruit party from the Flemish side, and MR and the centrist Les Engagés from the Francophone side <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1132172/whats-the-latest-on-belgiums-federal-government-formation</citation> <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>. This potential coalition reflected the regional governments being formed in Flanders (N-VA, CD&V, Vooruit) and Wallonia (MR, Les Engagés) <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1132172/whats-the-latest-on-belgiums-federal-government-formation</citation> <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n\nHowever, negotiations proved difficult from the outset. Vooruit, as the only left-leaning party in the proposed federal coalition, expressed significant reservations about joining a government dominated by centre-right partners, particularly concerning conservative fiscal reforms, tax cuts, and their potential impact on social security and pensions <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-belgiums-federal-government-crisis-deepens-as-possible-coalition-nears-collapse</citation> <citation>https://brusselssignal.eu/2024/11/belgian-federal-government-talks-collapse-again/</citation>. In July 2024, Vooruit, led by Conner Rousseau, agreed to give the talks a \"fair chance\" after De Wever reportedly made efforts to address their concerns <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1132172/whats-the-latest-on-belgiums-federal-government-formation</citation>.\n\n**Collapse of Talks and Renewed Efforts**\n\nDespite initial cautious optimism, the deep-seated ideological differences, particularly regarding socio-economic policies, led to a crisis in the negotiations. On November 4, 2024, after 148 days of talks, Bart De Wever announced the collapse of the negotiations and tendered his resignation as \"formateur\" to the King <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-belgiums-federal-government-crisis-deepens-as-possible-coalition-nears-collapse</citation> <citation>https://brusselssignal.eu/2024/11/belgian-federal-government-talks-collapse-again/</citation>. The primary reason cited was Vooruit's refusal to support a right-leaning government program that they felt would compromise social protections <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-belgiums-federal-government-crisis-deepens-as-possible-coalition-nears-collapse</citation> <citation>https://brusselssignal.eu/2024/11/belgian-federal-government-talks-collapse-again/</citation>. King Philippe postponed accepting De Wever's resignation, urging further efforts to find a solution amidst fears of a prolonged period of political instability, potentially echoing the 541-day crisis of 2010-2011 <citation>https://brusselssignal.eu/2024/11/belgian-federal-government-talks-collapse-again/</citation>.\n\nThe specific details of how the deadlock was overcome in the subsequent months are not extensively publicized, but negotiations eventually resumed. After 236 days since the election, a breakthrough was achieved <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n\n**Formation of the \"Arizona\" Government**\n\nOn Monday, February 3, 2025, Belgium's new Federal \"Arizona\" Government was sworn in before King Philippe, with N-VA's Bart De Wever as the new Prime Minister <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1424985/whos-in-belgiums-new-federal-government</citation>. The coalition comprises the Flemish right-wing N-VA, Christian Democrat CD&V, and socialist Vooruit, alongside the Francophone liberal MR and centrist Les Engagés <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1424985/whos-in-belgiums-new-federal-government</citation> <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n\nThe 15-member federal cabinet includes 14 ministers (seven Francophone, six Dutch-speaking) plus the Prime Minister. Key appointments include:\n*   **Jan Jambon (N-VA):** Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Combating Fiscal Fraud, Pensions, National Lottery and Cultural Institutions.\n*   **David Clarinval (MR):** Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Works, Economy and Agriculture.\n*   **Maxime Prévot (Les Engagés):** Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Affairs and Development Cooperation.\n*   **Frank Vandenbroucke (Vooruit):** Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health and Social Affairs.\n*   **Vincent Van Peteghem (CD&V):** Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget and Administrative Simplification <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1424985/whos-in-belgiums-new-federal-government</citation>.\n\n**Policy Agenda of the New Government**\n\nThe new government's program prioritizes consolidating Belgium's strained public finances and implementing tighter immigration policies <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>. Given the ideologically diverse nature of the coalition, the reforms are described as somewhat modest. Key measures include requiring citizens to work slightly longer for a full state pension, a slight reduction in Belgium's high taxes on salaries, the introduction of a capital gains tax, and ending the indefinite provision of unemployment benefits <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n\nOn immigration, the government plans to move away from private housing for asylum seekers towards collective reception centers, limit family reunification through increased income thresholds and language/citizenship tests, and explore sending illegal immigrants who commit crimes to serve sentences abroad. It also intends to unify the six police zones in Brussels into a single entity <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n\nDespite N-VA's nationalist roots and long-term aim for Belgium's gradual dissolution into a confederation, the immediate government program places less emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government. However, the agreement includes a commitment to ongoing exploration of institutional reforms, though such changes would require a challenging two-thirds majority in parliament <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>. The significant budget deficits at regional levels, particularly in Brussels and Wallonia, are seen as potential future drivers for more substantial institutional reform <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n\nThe elections also recorded one of the lowest turnouts since compulsory voting was introduced in 1893, marking a notable feature of this political cycle <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. Observers remain skeptical about whether the announced policies will be sufficient to address Belgium's significant budget deficit and complex institutional challenges <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n</answer>"

    "system": "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question. \\\nYou can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.\n\n## Tool Use Formatting\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Execute safe mathematical expressions.\\n\\nSupports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **) and common mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc.).\\nFor security reasons, only mathematical expressions are allowed, no arbitrary code execution.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Mathematical expression to calculate, e.g., \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\", \\\"sin(30 * pi / 180)\\\", \\\"sqrt(16)\\\"\"}}, \"required\": [\"expression\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n",
