Given the previous turn is empty, and this is the beginning of the article, I will start by researching the immediate aftermath of a Botswana election and the campaign promises of the major parties. I will specifically search for information about the reactions to the election results and the key pledges made by the leading parties during the campaign to set the stage for a deeper dive into the specific 2024 election. This involves checking for reports of concessions, celebrations, and statements from key figures. Understanding the major campaign promises is vital for grasping the election's context and significance. So, I'll look for details on economic diversification plans, minimum wage proposals, and other significant policy announcements.",

Masisi said he had called Boko to inform him he was conceding defeat and said that Boko was now effectively the president-elect.Final results were expected to be announced later Friday, but the BDP had no path to a majority. It followed an equally momentous change in neighboring South Africa, where the long-ruling African National Congress lost its 30-year majority in an election in May and was forced to share power for the first time in a coalition government.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[2]:\nTITLE: General election ends Botswana Democratic Party's 58 years in power\nURL: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-01/botswana-election-ends-ruling-party-58-years-in-power/104551974\nCONTENT: Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi has conceded defeat after preliminary results showed his party lost its parliamentary majority by a landslide in this week's election, ending nearly six\n--------------------------------------------------\n[3]:\nTITLE: Botswana's ruling party loses election, ending 58-year rule\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/01/africa/botswana-party-loses-election-masisi-boko-intl/index.html\nCONTENT: Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat on Friday after preliminary results showed his party had lost its parliamentary majority by a landslide in this week's election, ending\n--------------------------------------------------\n[4]:\nTITLE: Seismic change in Botswana as party that ruled for 58 years loses power\nURL: https://apnews.com/article/botswana-election-masisi-concedes-80951b62fdb7169f073c2b13acaff1b6\nCONTENT: The party of Botswana's opposition candidate Duma Boko has been declared the election winner over incumbent President Mokgweetsi Masisi in a seismic change that ended the ruling party's 58 years in power since independence from Britain.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[5]:\nTITLE: Botswana opposition wins election; BDP ousted from power after 58 years\nURL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/botswanas-ruling-party-loses-power-after-six-decades-early-results-show\nCONTENT: Botswana votes in election amid diamond crisis: All you need to know.

Major shifts—ranging from growing economic discontent, the return of former president Khama and the BDP’s internal divisions—have turned this into an election that is up in the air. Decades-long dominance shook when Ian Khama, Seretse’s son and former president, threw his support behind the newly formed Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and the opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), leading to significant swings in favour of the opposition. Former president Ian Khama’s recent return to Botswana, after three years of self-imposed exile in South Africa, has injected fresh energy and tension into the political landscape ahead of the election.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[6]:\nTITLE: The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) 100 Days in Office: Tracking ...\nURL: https://connect.sivioinstitute.org/2025/02/17/the-umbrella-for-democratic-change-udc-100-days-in-office-tracking-government-actions-inactions-against-electoral-promises-in-botswana/\nCONTENT: The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) 100 Days in Office: Tracking Government Actions/Inactions Against Electoral Promises in Botswana – SIVIO Connect The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) 100 Days in Office: Tracking Government Actions/Inactions Against Electoral Promises in Botswana SIVIO Institute has developed the Botswana Citizens Watch Tracker to systematically track and provide evidence of actions of the UDC government under President Duma Gideon Boko to fulfil promises made during elections and other major policy pronouncements it will make during its term of office.

GABORONE, Botswana (AP) — Botswana votes in a national election this week that will decide if the ruling party extends a 58-year stretch in power in a southern African country that is a leading diamond producer and often held up as one of the most stable and least corrupt democracies on the continent. President Mokgweetsi Masisi of the ruling Botswana Democratic Party, or BDP, is seeking a second and final term in office, although Wednesday’s election isn’t directly for president. Khama, the son of Botswana’s founding president, quit the BDP and went into exile in South Africa in 2021, accusing Masisi of taking an authoritarian approach to criticism.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[10]:\nTITLE: After the election follows an era of yes-men :: Mmegi Online\nURL: https://www.mmegi.bw/opinion-amp-analysis/after-the-election-follows-an-era-of-yes-men/news\nCONTENT: Industrial relations In what may be seen as a litmus test for the UDC government’s employee relations policies, it has already exchanged fire with at least four of the country’s trade unions, being the Botswana Teachers Union (BTU) and the Botswana Sectors of Educators Trade Unions (BOSETU), the Botswana Nurses Union and the Botswana Doctors Union (BDU). More worrying announcements While the UDC has previously condemned the direct tender method, as it saw it as open to abuse, the President announced this week that his government would opt for direct tender, “for some projects.” Although, as expected, there has been criticism from the opposition, there have also been a good number of those who applauded the announcement.\n--------------------------------------------------Query: Botswana election 2024 reactions\nSearch Results:\n--------------------------------------------------\n[1]:\nTITLE: Botswana's 2024 Election Milestone and the Quest for True Representation.\nURL: https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation\nCONTENT: The 2024 Botswana general election marked a historic moment in the nation's political landscape, heralded as a triumph of democracy in Southern Africa. Since gaining independence in 1966, Botswana has maintained a consistent record of holding regular democratic elections, though the political sphere has been dominated by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) for nearly six decades.

However, opposition political parties expressed dissatisfaction with the incomplete constitutional review process and lack of state funding, arguing that it may lead to an uneven playing field and affect the credibility of the outcome of the elections. However, for future elections, the country will need to take steps to address gaps in the legal framework, especially in relation to fixing the election date, finalising the constitutional review process and reassessing the state funding of political parties, which may cause political instability.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[7]:\nTITLE: IEC reaches its target of 80% voter registrati­on - PressReader\nURL: https://www.pressreader.com/botswana/mmegi/20240705/281539411163089\nCONTENT: PressReader.com - Digital Newspaper & Magazine Subscriptions Work with us Work with us PressReader Saved Searches RESCUERS work Fri­day in Kyiv, Ukraine, at a res­id­en­tial build­ing des­troyed by Rus­sia.

Since gaining independence in 1966, Botswana has maintained a consistent record of holding regular democratic elections, though the political sphere has been dominated by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) for nearly six decades. Botswana uses the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) majority system for both National Assembly and Local Government elections.

Decades-long dominance shook when Ian Khama, Seretse’s son and former president, threw his support behind the newly formed Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and the opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), leading to significant swings in favour of the opposition.

Duma Boko is the leader of the Botswana National Front and president of an opposition coalition, the Umbrella for Democratic Change. Boko’s government is taking charge of a country with underdevelopment challenges. Secondly, Boko’s government needs to unite the nation, which became increasingly divided as the ruction between Masisi and former president Ian Khama escalated. This requires revamping institutions that ensure transparency and accountability in government, containing the rogue intelligence directorate and ending wasteful expenditure and corruption.

In the latest election, the UDC ran in direct opposition to the BDP, arguing that the long-ruling party had repeatedly failed to deliver for the 2.5 million people of Botswana on issues ranging from the economy to healthcare, made worse by allegations of corruption. The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which has ruled the country since independence in 1990, fell below a two-thirds parliamentary majority in 2019 for the first time and is facing a strong challenge from numerous opposition parties in elections scheduled for November 27.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[4]:\nTITLE: Botswana Votes 2019: Two-Party Competition and the Khama Factor\nURL: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03057070.2020.1778901\nCONTENT: The October 2019 Botswana national election, which returned the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) to power for the twelfth consecutive time, was dominated by a man whose name was not even on the ballot: former President Ian Khama. ... 52 For media analysis of Boko's future, see T.

Major shifts—ranging from growing economic discontent, the return of former president Khama and the BDP’s internal divisions—have turned this into an election that is up in the air. Decades-long dominance shook when Ian Khama, Seretse’s son and former president, threw his support behind the newly formed Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and the opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), leading to significant swings in favour of the opposition. Former president Ian Khama’s recent return to Botswana, after three years of self-imposed exile in South Africa, has injected fresh energy and tension into the political landscape ahead of the election.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[6]:\nTITLE: Election results | Botswana | IPU Parline: global data on national ...\nURL: https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/\nCONTENT: Election results | Botswana | IPU Parline: global data on national parliaments Data on parliamentary elections, including the background, candidates, voter turnout, results and the formation of the new legislature.

The electoral victory of UDC, a coalition of BDP’s historic rivals the Botswana National Front (BNF) and Botswana Peoples Party (BPP), alongside Alliance for Progressives (AP) founded largely by former BDP young turks, changed the Botswana political landscape. This seamless transition into what the incoming Vice President Mr Ndaba Gaolathe called ‘the New Botswana’ concluded an eventful year in politics.

Botswana’s political parties need to address the under-representation of women in their own structures and in the selection of candidates for elections. As Botswana enters a new era, political parties need to make deliberate and concerted efforts to increase the number of women in decision-making.\n--------------------------------------------------"

Given that the previous section introduces the election, this section needs to delve into any controversies or disputes surrounding the observation of the election, including concerns raised by opposition parties, observers, or other stakeholders. Based on my memo, I will structure this section by first addressing the general concerns about fairness and transparency, then specifically noting the legal challenges and claims of vote rigging, and concluding with the perspectives from international observer missions. This will give a balanced overview of the issues. The memo contains information about voter registration challenges, opposition concerns, and the 2019 election controversies which can also be used to contextualize the 2024 election.\n\nI have gathered sufficient information from the search results to start writing the preface section for the 2024 Botswana general election article.

Prior to the election, opposition parties voiced concerns regarding the incomplete constitutional review process and the lack of state funding, which they argued could potentially undermine the fairness of the electoral process <citation>https://www.up.ac.za/news/post_3252222-up-expert-opinion-up-expert-assesses-botswanas-state-of-readiness-for-2024-elections</citation>.

Former President Ian Khama's support for the newly formed Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and the UDC further fueled the opposition's momentum <citation>https://africaelects.com/2024/10/28/botswana-inside-the-countrys-most-competitive-election-to-date/</citation>.\n\nBoth the BDP and the UDC presented manifestos with distinct priorities.

Key promises included increasing the average salary to P10,000 or more and creating an equitable economy with an annual growth rate of at least 10% <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/udc-unveils-inclusive-growth-quality-lives-election-manifesto/</citation>.

While the IEC initially registered 736,424 prospective voters by February 3, 2023, which was only 69% of their 1.7 million target, a decline of 11,177 from the first phase of registration in previous elections when 747,601 voters were registered <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/iec-records-a-decline-in-registered-voters/news</citation>, they eventually reached over one million registered voters after the second supplementary registration, totaling 1,005,909, which was 80% of the 1.3 million target <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/iec-exceeds-historic-1-million-mark-in-voter-registration/</citation>.\n\nThe voter registration process was not without its challenges. It faced disruptions due to a court battle between the IEC and the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/iec-ready-for-voter-registration/news</citation><citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/supplementary-voters-registration-starts-monday/news</citation>. There were also reports of challenges during the initial voter registration, including late arrivals or absence of registration clerks <citation>https://guardiansun.co.bw/news/politics/voter-registration-challenges-undermine-elections-integrity</citation> .\n### Background of opposition parties before the election\n\nPrior to the 2024 Botswana general election, several opposition parties sought to challenge the long-ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP). A key player was the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), which aimed to unite several parties under one umbrella <citation>https://www.theafricareport.com/364113/botswana-elections-meet-the-parties/</citation>. The UDC's election manifesto, titled \"Inclusive Growth and Quality Lives,\" focused on addressing challenges facing the nation <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/udc-unveils-inclusive-growth-quality-lives-election-manifesto/</citation>, with promises including increasing the average salary to P10,000 or more and creating an equitable economy with a 10% annual growth rate <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/udc-unveils-inclusive-growth-quality-lives-election-manifesto/</citation>. The UDC also pledged to create a National Community Service programme with a monthly allowance of P2,500 <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/udc-unveils-inclusive-growth-quality-lives-election-manifesto/</citation>. Duma Boko, of the Umbrella for Democratic Change, is now President-elect <citation>https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/botswana-elections/</citation>.\n\nOther significant parties included the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), which gained support from former President Ian Khama after he split from the BDP <citation>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c238n5zr51yo</citation>. His support for the BPF and UDC led to significant swings toward the opposition <citation>https://africaelects.com/2024/10/28/botswana-inside-the-countrys-most-competitive-election-to-date/</citation>. The Botswana Congress Party (BCP) also played a role, securing 15 seats <citation>https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024</citation>. The Alliance for Progressives (AP) also participated in the election <citation>https://www.africa-press.net/botswana/all-news/botswanas-political-landscape-gearing-up-for-the-2024-general-election</citation>.\n### Composition of parliament\n\nThe Botswana parliament, officially known as the National Assembly, consists of 65 members. Of these, 57 are directly elected to five-year terms from single-member constituencies using the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/4357/</citation><citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/29/</citation>. In addition to the elected members, the National Assembly includes four members elected by the Assembly from a list provided by the President, as well as the President and the Attorney General <citation>https://north-africa.com/botswana-2024-elections-preview/</citation>.\n\nThe 2024 general election brought a significant shift in the political landscape, ending the Botswana Democratic Party's (BDP) 58-year rule <citation>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/seismic-change-botswana-party-ruled-58-years-loses-power-rcna178353</citation>. The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), led by Duma Boko, secured a victory, winning 26 seats in the 61-seat legislature <citation>https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/01/shock-election-outcome-ends-botswana-ruling-partys-58-year-rule</citation>.\n\nFollowing the 2024 polls, the number of female legislators increased from 7 out of 62 (11%) to 10.6% of the candidates being women <citation>https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024</citation><citation>https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/4357/</citation>.\n### Previous election\n\nThe previous general election in Botswana was held in 2019. The main candidates were Mokgweetsi Masisi of the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) and Duma Boko of the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC). Mokgweetsi Masisi won the election, allowing him to claim a five-year term <citation>https://yourbotswana.com/2019/10/27/he-mokgweetsi-masisi-bdp-wins-botswana-2019-general-election/</citation>. The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) secured 38 seats <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/52572</citation> and <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/25/botswanas-ruling-party-bdp-wins-general-election-chief-justice/</citation>, while the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) won 3 seats <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/52572</citation>. Voter turnout was 84%, with 777,943 Batswana casting their votes <citation>https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fluctuating+voting_trends+in+Botswana.-a0779611920</citation>. A total of 925,478 people had registered to vote <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/29/</citation>.\n\nThe 2019 Botswana National Election was dominated by former President Ian Khama <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03057070.2020.1778901</citation>, despite not being on the ballot. Khama defected from the BDP for the first time in Botswana's electoral democracy <citation>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342685968_Botswana_Votes_2019_Two-Party_Competition_and_the_Khama_Factor</citation>. Some claimed that the 2019 Botswana General Elections were not over legally due to petitions filed by the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) before the High Court <citation>https://www.sundaystandard.info/sadc-shelves-report-on-botswana-elections-outcome/</citation>. Opposition leader Duma Boko claimed massive vote-rigging and fraud occurred during the 2019 elections to favor Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi <citation>https://www.citizen.co.za/news/news-world/news-africa/massive-vote-rigging-uncovered-in-botswana-elections-claims-opposition-leader/</citation>. Forensics for Justice reported evidence suggesting the 2019 election was rigged in favor of the BDP with the help of intelligence services <citation>https://www.biznews.com/global-citizen/2019/12/05/botswana-election-rigged-forensics-justice</citation>. The Electoral Amendment Act of 2016, which introduced electronic voting for the 2019 general elections, caused controversy, with the Botswana Congress Party (BCP) claiming it was susceptible to manipulation <citation>https://freedomhouse.org/country/botswana/freedom-world/2019</citation>. The African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) was present for the 2019 Botswana General Elections <citation>https://au.int/sites/default/files/documents/38699-doc-report_of_the_african_union_election_observation_mission_to_the_23_october_2019_general_elections_in_the_republic_of_botswana.pdf</citation>.\n### Seat redistribution\n\nThe 2024 Botswana General Election resulted in a significant redistribution of seats within the National Assembly, marking a departure from the long-standing dominance of the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which had been in power since 1966 <citation>https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/economy/botswanas-historic-election-a-shift-from-58-years-of-bdp-dominance-ab55a9bd-a011-4b31-a95c-b72c39c1bf78</citation><citation>https://apnews.com/article/botswana-election-masisi-concedes-80951b62fdb7169f073c2b13acaff1b6</citation><citation>https://www.theafricareport.com/366164/botswanas-presidential-election-meet-the-candidates/</citation>. The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), led by Duma Boko, secured a majority in the National Assembly, winning 36 out of the 61 seats <citation>https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024</citation>, while the BDP won four seats <citation>https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024</citation>. In total, the UDC secured 26 seats in Botswana’s 61-seat legislature <citation>https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/01/shock-election-outcome-ends-botswana-ruling-partys-58-year-rule</citation>. The president in Botswana is indirectly elected by the National Assembly <citation>https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2024-elections/botswana/</citation>. The National Assembly consists of 65 members, including 57 members directly elected via the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system in single-seat constituencies, four members elected by the National Assembly from a list provided by the President, and the President and the Attorney General <citation>https://north-africa.com/botswana-2024-elections-preview/</citation>. With this election, Botswana is opening important discussions about the nature of representation and the potential for electoral reform <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>.\n### MPs not standing for re-election\n\nSeveral Members of Parliament (MPs) did not return for the 13th Parliament following the 2024 general election for various reasons <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/mps-unlikely-to-return-for-the-13th-parliament/news</citation>. These reasons included quitting, retiring, failing to win their party's primary elections, or choosing not to contest <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/mps-unlikely-to-return-for-the-13th-parliament/news</citation>. Duma Boko, President of the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), confirmed reports that he would not contest any constituency in the 2024 general election <citation>https://guardiansun.co.bw/news/udc-president-boko-not-contesting-in-2024/news</citation>. Other MPs were unlikely to return after failing to make it past their parties’ primary elections <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/mps-unlikely-to-return-for-the-13th-parliament/news</citation>.\n### Presidential nominees\n\nIn Botswana's parliamentary system, the President is not directly elected by popular vote. Instead, the Members of Parliament (MPs) elect the president <citation>https://www.africauptodate.com/botswana-general-elections-2024-begin</citation>. Candidates for the National Assembly declare which presidential candidate they support on the ballot paper, influencing the selection of the president by the newly elected MPs <citation>https://north-africa.com/botswana-2024-elections-preview/</citation>.\n\nFor the 2024 general election, the declared presidential candidates represented the leading political parties: Mokgweetsi E.K. Masisi (Botswana Democratic Party - BDP), Dumelang Saleshando (Botswana Congress Party - BCP), Duma Boko (Umbrella for Democratic Change - UDC), and Mephato Reatile (Botswana Patriotic Front - BPF) <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82038</citation>. However, Biggie Butale, leader of the Botswana Republican Party (BRP), did not qualify as a presidential candidate <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82038</citation>.\n\nEach candidate presented a distinct vision for Botswana's future. Masisi, seeking a second term, emphasized creating a thriving economy, fair wages, and a strong rule of law <citation>https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/africa/2024-09-02-botswanas-president-masisi-launches-bdp-manifesto-ahead-of-2024-elections</citation>. The BDP manifesto also included plans for advancing the health sector and improving infrastructure <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/features/botswana-democratic-party-bdp-manifesto-highlights/</citation>. Boko, leading the UDC, campaigned on a platform of \"Inclusive Growth, Quality Lives,\" promising to increase the average salary and create an equitable economy <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/udc-unveils-inclusive-growth-quality-lives-election-manifesto/</citation>. The UDC also pledged investments in 5G networks and affordable housing <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/features/umbrella-for-democratic-change-udc-manifesto-highlights/</citation>. The BCP, under Saleshando, focused on \"saving Botswana\" and offering a living wage of 4,000 pula <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/botswana-election-who-is-in-the-running-and-whats-at-stake</citation>.\n### Observation controversy\n\nThe 2024 Botswana General Election, while marking a significant moment in the nation's democratic history <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>, was not without its controversies. Prior to the election, opposition parties voiced concerns regarding the incomplete constitutional review process and the lack of state funding, which they argued could potentially undermine the fairness of the electoral process <citation>https://www.up.ac.za/news/post_3252222-up-expert-opinion-up-expert-assesses-botswanas-state-of-readiness-for-2024-elections</citation>. These concerns built upon previous elections, such as the 2019 election, where the Electoral Amendment Act of 2016, introducing electronic voting, sparked controversy, with the Botswana Congress Party (BCP) claiming it was susceptible to manipulation <citation>https://freedomhouse.org/country/botswana/freedom-world/2019</citation>.\n\nThe voter registration process also faced disruptions, including a court battle between the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/iec-ready-for-voter-registration/news</citation><citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/supplementary-voters-registration-starts-monday/news</citation>, and reports of challenges during the initial voter registration, such as late arrivals or the absence of registration clerks <citation>https://guardiansun.co.bw/news/politics/voter-registration-challenges-undermine-elections-integrity</citation>. Opposition leader Duma Boko had also claimed massive vote-rigging and fraud occurred during the 2019 elections <citation>https://www.citizen.co.za/news/news-world/news-africa/massive-vote-rigging-uncovered-in-botswana-elections-claims-opposition-leader/</citation>, and even petitioned the constituency election outcome after the 2019 elections <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/duma-boko-petitions-constituency-election-outcome/news</citation>. Claims also arose from Forensics for Justice alleging that the 2019 election was rigged in favor of the BDP with the help of intelligence services <citation>https://www.biznews.com/global-citizen/2019/12/05/botswana-election-rigged-forensics-justice</citation>. The court of appeal accepted to hear an opposition challenge to the outcome of the 2019 elections <citation>https://www.africanews.com/2020/01/09/botswana-court-to-adjudicate-2019-election-petition-case/</citation>.\n\nInternational observer missions, such as the Southern African Development Community Electoral Observation Mission (SEOM) <citation>https://www.sadc.int/latest-news/head-sadc-electoral-observation-mission-presents-preliminary-statement-following-0</citation> and the African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) <citation>https://au.int/sites/default/files/documents/38699-doc-report_of_the_african_union_election_observation_mission_to_the_23_october_2019_general_elections_in_the_republic_of_botswana.pdf</citation>, were present for previous elections like the 2019 General Elections. Their perspectives and reports often provide an independent assessment of the electoral process, which can either validate or contradict claims of irregularities and lack of transparency.",
