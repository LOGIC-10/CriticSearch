The swift offensive—initiated on November 27 by a coalition led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), along with various Turkish-backed factions, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Southern Operations Room, and other armed groups—quickly overwhelmed pro-government forces. But as the Syrian government, entangled in corruption and dependent on alliances with Russia and Iran, weakened under domestic discontent and international strain, the opposition sensed a strategic opening. On November 27, 2024, HTS announced an operation it called “Deterrence of Aggression.” Rebels attacked positions of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) in the western Aleppo countryside, claiming it was a direct response to government shelling that had killed civilians in Idlib.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an ...\\nURL: https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and\\nCONTENT: The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an opportunity for Turkey and a challenge for Russia | OSW Centre for Eastern Studies The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an opportunity for Turkey and a challenge for Russia In recent days, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reportedly visited Moscow, while the leaders of Russia and Iran engaged in telephone discussions, as did the foreign ministers of these countries and Turkey.

The official Russian news agency TASS cited the Syrian army command in a report Sunday as saying that their air forces “stepped up strikes on terrorist positions and their supply lines, with dozens killed and wounded.” The White Helmets said at least four people were killed on Sunday in airstrikes on Idlib city, a province that now appears to be entirely in rebel hands.

Both sides eventually reconciled, but even within the Astana process—a diplomatic framework launched in 2017 by Iran, Russia, and Turkey to facilitate negotiations on the Syrian conflict and de-escalation zones—they have pursued conflicting aims: Russia supports the Assad regime’s full territorial control, while Turkey backs opposition forces and maintains a military presence in northern Syria to prevent Kurdish autonomy there.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: RUSSIA'S STRATEGIC DISASTER IN SYRIA - The Military Analyst\\nURL: https://themilitaryanalyst.com/2024/12/09/russias-strategic-disaster-in-syria/\\nCONTENT: Russia used Latakia and Tartus to funnel aid to Haftar, including flying Su-34, and Su-27's there by alleged mercenaries.

It represents a critical inflection point in global power dynamics, with far-reaching consequences for regional stability, domestic politics, and Russia's global standing, write Natia Gamkrelidze and Neil MacFarlane. To understand whether Syria's developments have bearing on Russia, one must consider the implications for Moscow’s geopolitical ambitions, its military infrastructure, and its capacity to sustain influence in multiple regions.

However, the composition of the advancing force comprised a range of opposition groups with both secular and Islamist ideologies, and has rapidly broadened as former opposition fighters unaffiliated with any groups in north-west Syria have joined the growing rebel front.

        "value": "<answer>\n### Russia\n\nIn the wake of the significant offensive launched by Syrian opposition forces on November 27, 2024, Russia is facing a critical challenge to its longstanding support for the Assad regime. The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities. \n</answer>"

Yet here, too, Israelâs actions are self-defeating in that Syriaâs new government is increasingly leaning on Turkey to protect it from Israel. This may sound far-fetched, but the last time Israel launched a sustained campaign of provocations against Syria, it started an escalation spiral that ended in the âSix Day War.â Netanyahu may be betting that it can induce a similar transformative event that reshapes the regional balance of power in its favour yet again.\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: 2024 Syrian opposition military strategy\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: Syria's Post-Assad Era: Transitional Strategies, Conflict, and ...\\nURL: https://americancenter.org/2024/12/12/syrias-post-assad-era/\\nCONTENT: Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz stated on Tuesday, December 10, 2024, that he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the army to establish a demilitarized zone in southern Syria following the fall of the Assad regime.

In the early hours of Wednesday, opposition factions including the Sunni Islamist group Tahrir al-Sham launched the battles, ultimately capturing multiple villages and towns in the western Aleppo countryside. Special military sources told The Media Line that the opposition’s factions captured approximately 10 individuals, including Russian personnel, and killed or injured dozens more.

Regime forces likely hoped to regroup and organize a defensive position here, but reports suggest FM units began assaulting the town late at night on the 27th.

Government troops loyal to the president have been trying to repel the rebels, rushing reinforcements to the battlefield, launching airstrikes and getting support from Russian fighter jets, the Observatory has said.

These efforts have been marked by turmoil across the broader political landscape, including the states supporting the uprising, the various opposition armed forces, and the dynamics between these groups, Assad himself and pro-Assad factions in Syria and abroad.

However, the composition of the advancing force comprised a range of opposition groups with both secular and Islamist ideologies, and has rapidly broadened as former opposition fighters unaffiliated with any groups in north-west Syria have joined the growing rebel front.

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria.

In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance.

The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama.

        "value": "任务：写一个简短的2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n前面已写的内容：### Russia\n\nIn the wake of the significant offensive launched by Syrian opposition forces on November 27, 2024, Russia is facing a critical challenge to its longstanding support for the Assad regime. The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA).

Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Domestic\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

Government troops loyal to the president have been trying to repel the rebels, rushing reinforcements to the battlefield, launching airstrikes and getting support from Russian fighter jets, the Observatory has said.

Given Turkey’s history of military incursions and campaigns against the Syrian Democratic Forces in northern cities like Afrin and Kobani, the Kurdish group may need to align with some factions of the opposition, likely Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, should the U.S. eventually withdraw.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Renewed Syrian Conflict: Key Developments and Implications of the New ...\\nURL: https://vajiramandravi.com/upsc-daily-current-affairs/mains-articles/renewed-syrian-conflict-key-developments-and-implications-of-the-new-rebel-offensive/\\nCONTENT: Renewed Syrian Conflict: Key Developments and Implications of the New Rebel Offensive What’s in today’s article?

        "value": "任务：写一个简短的2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n前面已写的内容：### Russia\n\nIn the wake of the significant offensive launched by Syrian opposition forces on November 27, 2024, Russia is facing a critical challenge to its longstanding support for the Assad regime. The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.

As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Opening advances\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

However, the composition of the advancing force comprised a range of opposition groups with both secular and Islamist ideologies, and has rapidly broadened as former opposition fighters unaffiliated with any groups in north-west Syria have joined the growing rebel front. The stretch of the city between the Al-Muhafazah district and New Aleppo fell rapidly to opposition forces, resulting in very limited fighting in the streets and a marked degree of continuity in daily life for many residents.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: In a shock offensive, insurgents breach Syria's largest city for the ...\\nURL: https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085\\nCONTENT: Syrian opposition fighters get off a truck as they enter the village of Anjara, western outskirts of Aleppo, Syria, Thursday Nov. 28, 2024, part of their major offensive on government-controlled areas in the country’s northwestern Syria.

This may sound far-fetched, but the last time Israel launched a sustained campaign of provocations against Syria, it started an escalation spiral that ended in the âSix Day War.â Netanyahu may be betting that it can induce a similar transformative event that reshapes the regional balance of power in its favour yet again.\\n--------------------------------------------------\"</result></tool_use_result>"

On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n</answer>"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Iran\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Iran\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

        "value": "<answer>\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n</answer>"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Turkey\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Turkey\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The presence of Turkish-backed forces in northeastern Syria has increased substantially since insurgent groups ousted former President Bashar Assad late last year, and the forces have been targeting Kurdish forces more often. Turkey also views the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed military Kurdish alliance in Syria, as an extension of the PKK.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Syria: Turkey's Increasing Influence and Military Presence\\nURL: https://www.specialeurasia.com/2025/02/06/syria-turkey-military-base/\\nCONTENT: Syria: Turkey’s Growing Influence and Military Cooperation with Transitional Government The Turkish-Syrian security pact is not yet finalised, but it represents a significant step in Ankara’s increasing influence over the Middle Eastern country.

        "value": "<answer>\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle. </answer>"

        "value": "任务：写一个简短的2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n前面已写的内容：### Russia\n\nIn the wake of the significant offensive launched by Syrian opposition forces on November 27, 2024, Russia is facing a critical challenge to its longstanding support for the Assad regime. The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Closing offensives\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters.

The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Closing offensives\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

However, the composition of the advancing force comprised a range of opposition groups with both secular and Islamist ideologies, and has rapidly broadened as former opposition fighters unaffiliated with any groups in north-west Syria have joined the growing rebel front. The stretch of the city between the Al-Muhafazah district and New Aleppo fell rapidly to opposition forces, resulting in very limited fighting in the streets and a marked degree of continuity in daily life for many residents.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: Operation Deterrence of Aggression: Opposition Forces Redraw the Map in ...\\nURL: https://syrianobserver.com/syrian-actors/operation-deterrence-of-aggression-opposition-forces-redraw-the-map-in-northern-syria.html\\nCONTENT: Northern Syria is witnessing a major upheaval as opposition forces launch the ambitious Operation Deterrence of Aggression, targeting regime-held areas across Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. With unified military, political, and media operations, opposition factions aim to neutralize regime threats, reclaim displaced areas, and establish governance in liberated territories. In central Syria, opposition factions have rapidly advanced into the northern countryside of Hama, liberating key towns such as Kafr Nabuda, Qalaat al-Madiq, and Tayyibat al-Imam. With significant territorial gains, unified leadership, and a renewed sense of purpose, opposition factions have demonstrated their capacity to challenge the regime and advance their vision for a post-Assad Syria.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Reimagining Syria: A Roadmap for Peace and Prosperity Beyond Assad\\nURL: https://www.mei.edu/publications/reimagining-syria-roadmap-peace-and-prosperity-beyond-assad\\nCONTENT: 28 Orwa Ajjoub, “HTS and al-Qaeda in Syria: Reconciling the irreconcilable,” Middle East Institute, July 15, 2020, https://mei.edu/publications/hts-and-al-qaeda-syria-reconciling-irreconcilable. 29 Charles Lister and Hassan Hassan, “Is Syria Descending into Renewed Civil War?” moderated by Zeina Al-Shaib, Virtual Briefing Series, March 11, 2025, posted by the Middle East Institute, YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWAFxEDB_rw. 33 Charles Lister, “It’s Time for Syria’s Kurds to Fold,” Foreign Policy, February 20, 2025, https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/20/syria-transition-government-kurds-sdf/. 45 “Syria’s De Facto Leader Wants to Maintain ‘Respectful’ Ties with Iran, Russia,” RFE/RL, December 29, 2024, https://www.rferl.org/a/syria-russia-iran-sharaa-trump-assad/33257139.html; “Putin has a ‘constructive’ conversation in first call with Syria’s new leader, Kremlin says,” Associated Press, February 12, 2025, https://apnews.com/article/russia-syria-putin-sharaa-cc60fa41024e200cf1d0f6f8022bfb1c; “Iran tells United Nations Security Council it supports formation of inclusive gov’t in Syria,” Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, February 13, 2025, https://irangov.ir/detail/458315.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Syrian opposition advances close to Hama, piling pressure on al-Assad ...\\nURL: https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor\\nCONTENT: Anti-government fighters take possession of Syrian army military equipment and vehicles that were abandoned on the highway to Damascus, as they reach the town of Suran north of Syria's Hama city\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Why the Islamic State remains a threat in post-Assad Syria\\nURL: https://www.newarab.com/analysis/why-islamic-state-remains-threat-post-assad-syria\\nCONTENT: More broadly, she suggested that normalising Syria’s relations with Israel appeared to be part of the bargain, describing it as “likely to be straightforward,” though fraught with longer-term regional implications. “It thrives in political vacuums like the one Syria faces now.” One of the most significant political developments came in March 2025, when the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) signed an agreement to integrate into Syria’s national army. “Ensuring there are no cross-border safe havens for ISIS can only be assured if there is a simultaneous containment effort spanning both Syria and Iraq,” Tammer stressed. “The strategic key to undermining ISIS retention and future recruitment lies in the ability and rapidity of the Sharaa administration to appeal to those feeling disenfranchised politically, economically, and in religious terms,” she said.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Syria civil war bursts back into life: Ultimate guide to key players ...\\nURL: https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/world/3247387/syrian-civil-war-ultimate-guide-key-players/\\nCONTENT: Iranian-backed militia from Iraq have entered the conflict to support the Syrian efforts to maintain President Bashar Assad’s regime.

Iran’s international fighting forces, such as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, were a key factor in Assad’s ability to hold on to power despite early losses in the first four years of the Syrian civil war.

Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n</answer>"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Immediate aftermath\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria.

This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Immediate aftermath\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The abovementioned groundbreaking major ground offensive heralds a new era in the Syrian crisis and puts an end to the status quo ante established in Syria in the wake of Ankara’s ‘Operation Spring Shield’ against the regime and Iran-backed militias in March 2020. After the loss of Aleppo, the capture of the whole of Idlib, the march towards Hama province, and the seizing of Tal Rıf’at, the Syrian regime is likely to be forced to come to the negotiating table with Türkiye and indirectly Ankara-backed Syrian opposition forces.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Opposition fighters reportedly drive Syrian leader from the country ...\\nURL: https://apnews.com/article/syria-civil-war-rebels-turkey-iran-russia-0a5fddb5ee4065e93be374cbcdb01ff7\\nCONTENT: Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

But the group said in recent years it cut ties with al-Qaida, and experts say HTS has sought to remake itself in recent years by focusing on promoting civilian government in their territory as well as military action.

And Syrian troops withdrew Saturday from much of the central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, according to a pro-government outlet and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the annexed Golan Heights will remain part of Israel “forever,” following Bashar al-Assad’s fall.

The main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), has largely supported efforts to normalize relations with Assad, reflecting a rare point of consensus with Erdoğan, argues Gönül Tol. However, the opposition has also deeply criticized aspects of Ankara’s Syria policy, particularly its handling of the refugee crisis and entanglement in Syria’s convoluted war that has triggered terror attackswithin Turkey, killing many Turkish citizens. Critical factors to watch include the sustainability of Syrian opposition unity, their capacity to govern the territories under their control—particularly given their Islamist and radical roots—the effectiveness of refugee repatriation efforts, and potential shifts in the policies of major regional actors.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Reimagining Syria: A Roadmap for Peace and Prosperity Beyond Assad\\nURL: https://www.mei.edu/publications/reimagining-syria-roadmap-peace-and-prosperity-beyond-assad\\nCONTENT: 28 Orwa Ajjoub, “HTS and al-Qaeda in Syria: Reconciling the irreconcilable,” Middle East Institute, July 15, 2020, https://mei.edu/publications/hts-and-al-qaeda-syria-reconciling-irreconcilable. 29 Charles Lister and Hassan Hassan, “Is Syria Descending into Renewed Civil War?” moderated by Zeina Al-Shaib, Virtual Briefing Series, March 11, 2025, posted by the Middle East Institute, YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWAFxEDB_rw. 33 Charles Lister, “It’s Time for Syria’s Kurds to Fold,” Foreign Policy, February 20, 2025, https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/20/syria-transition-government-kurds-sdf/. 45 “Syria’s De Facto Leader Wants to Maintain ‘Respectful’ Ties with Iran, Russia,” RFE/RL, December 29, 2024, https://www.rferl.org/a/syria-russia-iran-sharaa-trump-assad/33257139.html; “Putin has a ‘constructive’ conversation in first call with Syria’s new leader, Kremlin says,” Associated Press, February 12, 2025, https://apnews.com/article/russia-syria-putin-sharaa-cc60fa41024e200cf1d0f6f8022bfb1c; “Iran tells United Nations Security Council it supports formation of inclusive gov’t in Syria,” Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, February 13, 2025, https://irangov.ir/detail/458315.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: PDF\\nURL: https://www.harmoon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Recent-Developments-in-Syria-Between-Military-Gains-and-Future-Challenges-1.pdf\\nCONTENT: Meanwhile, regime forces, Russia, Iranian militias, and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have continued to target areas controlled by the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).

From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n</answer>"

        "value": "任务：写一个简短的2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n前面已写的内容：### Russia\n\nIn the wake of the significant offensive launched by Syrian opposition forces on November 27, 2024, Russia is facing a critical challenge to its longstanding support for the Assad regime. The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>.

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior.

Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.

This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n</answer>"

        "value": "任务：写一个简短的2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n前面已写的内容：### Russia\n\nIn the wake of the significant offensive launched by Syrian opposition forces on November 27, 2024, Russia is facing a critical challenge to its longstanding support for the Assad regime. The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Fall of Damascus\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself.

The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Fall of Damascus\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n</answer>"

        "value": "任务：写一个简短的2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n前面已写的内容：### Russia\n\nIn the wake of the significant offensive launched by Syrian opposition forces on November 27, 2024, Russia is facing a critical challenge to its longstanding support for the Assad regime. The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Israel\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Israel\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

This may sound far-fetched, but the last time Israel launched a sustained campaign of provocations against Syria, it started an escalation spiral that ended in the âSix Day War.â Netanyahu may be betting that it can induce a similar transformative event that reshapes the regional balance of power in its favour yet again.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: Israel's defense chiefs discuss Syria fighting as rebel advance said to ...\\nURL: https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/\\nCONTENT: Israel's defense chiefs discuss Syria fighting as rebel advance said to exceed expectations Official says it's in Jerusalem's interest both sides fight, weaken each other, stresses Israel\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: Israel role in Syria conflict 2024\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: Syria's current conflict and its implications for Israel\\nURL: https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/\\nCONTENT: View of the border fence between Israel and Syria, northern Israel, Oct. 18, 2024.

The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n</answer>"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### International\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### International\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The abovementioned groundbreaking major ground offensive heralds a new era in the Syrian crisis and puts an end to the status quo ante established in Syria in the wake of Ankara’s ‘Operation Spring Shield’ against the regime and Iran-backed militias in March 2020. After the loss of Aleppo, the capture of the whole of Idlib, the march towards Hama province, and the seizing of Tal Rıf’at, the Syrian regime is likely to be forced to come to the negotiating table with Türkiye and indirectly Ankara-backed Syrian opposition forces.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: The Gulf Shifts Policies in Response to the \\\"New\\\" Syria\\nURL: https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en\\nCONTENT: Although Riyadh resumed its diplomatic relations with Tehran following a successful Chinese mediation, and both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi cooperated with the Iranian government to deescalate in Yemen and end hostilities there, Saudi and UAE foreign policies remained wary of the destructive role of Iran in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. The HTS government has confirmed Saudi and Emirati hopes by issuing the aforementioned decree banning Iranians from traveling to Syria and embracing good relations with Türkiye and the Gulf states as its strategic choice. This assertive foreign policy, which is apparent in Gaza, Lebanon as well as in Syria, can also make both Saudi Arabia and the UAE more prominent in regional security questions and more relevant for the great powers interested in stabilizing the Middle East in collaboration with regional actors.\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: current international involvement in Syrian conflict 2024\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: The Syria crisis explained: 5 things to know in 2024\\nURL: https://www.concern.org.uk/news/syria-crisis-explained-5-things-know-2024\\nCONTENT: A March 2019 report by UNICEF suggests that 40% of Syria's school infrastructure was destroyed in the conflict, creating huge gaps in the provision of education, and adverse protection risks.

        "value": "<answer>\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n</answer>"

        "value": "任务：写一个简短的2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n前面已写的内容：### Russia\n\nIn the wake of the significant offensive launched by Syrian opposition forces on November 27, 2024, Russia is facing a critical challenge to its longstanding support for the Assad regime. The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Analysis\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Analysis\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

Government troops loyal to the president have been trying to repel the rebels, rushing reinforcements to the battlefield, launching airstrikes and getting support from Russian fighter jets, the Observatory has said.

The operations enabled the factions of HTS and the National Army to achieve rapid territorial gains, allowing them to seize control of vast areas across the prov­ inces of Aleppo, Hama, and Idlib.

The offensive, coordinated primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, targeted regime positions surrounding the city of Aleppo, resulting in the rapid capture of numerous towns and strategic areas. By early December 2024, these forces had reportedly advanced to within a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself, showcasing their ability to reclaim territory previously lost to government forces <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe operation, dubbed \"Deter Aggression,\" was characterized by a unified front among various opposition factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This coalition reflected a strategic shift amidst a backdrop of declining Assad regime capabilities, especially as external support from Russia and Iranian forces faced strain due to the shifting local dynamics. The Turkish government’s influence has been pivotal, with its enforcement of no-fly zones aiding opposition advances and preventing retaliatory strikes from the regime <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nAs the conflict intensified, over 178,000 individuals were displaced due to the hostilities, highlighting the dire humanitarian impact of the recent military operations. Major cities, particularly in the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, continue to experience strife as opposition forces seek to consolidate their gains and shift the balance of power within Syria. The implications of these developments may extend beyond local control, influencing regional relations and drawing the attention of international actors invested in the Syrian theater <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe fall of the Assad regime on December 8, 2024, after over 50 years of Baath Party rule, signals a potential turning point in the Syrian civil war. This new landscape poses both opportunities and challenges for the opposition as they navigate governance and military strategy in a post-Assad environment. The stakes of these shifts are high, as they could lead to the reconfiguration of power not just in Syria, but across the broader Middle Eastern region <citation>https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/syria</citation>.\n</answer>"

        "value": "任务：写一个简短的2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n前面已写的内容：### Russia\n\nIn the wake of the significant offensive launched by Syrian opposition forces on November 27, 2024, Russia is facing a critical challenge to its longstanding support for the Assad regime. The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n## Analysis\n\nIn late November 2024, opposition forces in Syria launched a significant military offensive, marking one of the largest escalations in the ongoing conflict. The offensive, coordinated primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, targeted regime positions surrounding the city of Aleppo, resulting in the rapid capture of numerous towns and strategic areas. By early December 2024, these forces had reportedly advanced to within a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself, showcasing their ability to reclaim territory previously lost to government forces <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe operation, dubbed \"Deter Aggression,\" was characterized by a unified front among various opposition factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This coalition reflected a strategic shift amidst a backdrop of declining Assad regime capabilities, especially as external support from Russia and Iranian forces faced strain due to the shifting local dynamics. The Turkish government’s influence has been pivotal, with its enforcement of no-fly zones aiding opposition advances and preventing retaliatory strikes from the regime <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nAs the conflict intensified, over 178,000 individuals were displaced due to the hostilities, highlighting the dire humanitarian impact of the recent military operations. Major cities, particularly in the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, continue to experience strife as opposition forces seek to consolidate their gains and shift the balance of power within Syria. The implications of these developments may extend beyond local control, influencing regional relations and drawing the attention of international actors invested in the Syrian theater <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe fall of the Assad regime on December 8, 2024, after over 50 years of Baath Party rule, signals a potential turning point in the Syrian civil war. This new landscape poses both opportunities and challenges for the opposition as they navigate governance and military strategy in a post-Assad environment. The stakes of these shifts are high, as they could lead to the reconfiguration of power not just in Syria, but across the broader Middle Eastern region <citation>https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/syria</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Battle of Aleppo\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n## Analysis\n\nIn late November 2024, opposition forces in Syria launched a significant military offensive, marking one of the largest escalations in the ongoing conflict. The offensive, coordinated primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, targeted regime positions surrounding the city of Aleppo, resulting in the rapid capture of numerous towns and strategic areas. By early December 2024, these forces had reportedly advanced to within a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself, showcasing their ability to reclaim territory previously lost to government forces <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe operation, dubbed \"Deter Aggression,\" was characterized by a unified front among various opposition factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This coalition reflected a strategic shift amidst a backdrop of declining Assad regime capabilities, especially as external support from Russia and Iranian forces faced strain due to the shifting local dynamics. The Turkish government’s influence has been pivotal, with its enforcement of no-fly zones aiding opposition advances and preventing retaliatory strikes from the regime <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nAs the conflict intensified, over 178,000 individuals were displaced due to the hostilities, highlighting the dire humanitarian impact of the recent military operations. Major cities, particularly in the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, continue to experience strife as opposition forces seek to consolidate their gains and shift the balance of power within Syria.

Government troops loyal to the president have been trying to repel the rebels, rushing reinforcements to the battlefield, launching airstrikes and getting support from Russian fighter jets, the Observatory has said.

The offensive, launched by opposition fighters from the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), primarily comprised elements of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other allied factions, rapidly advanced into Aleppo, capturing dozens of towns and crucial military installations within days <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nBeginning on November 27, 2024, the offensive surprised government forces, leading to a swift collapse of previously established battle lines. By November 30, numerous reports confirmed that opposition forces had gained control over large parts of Aleppo city, including the airport, marking a drastic shift in territorial control across the northwest, notably in provinces like Hama and Idlib <citation>https://www.ryanjhite.com/2024/12/03/the-fall-of-aleppo-2024-a-turning-point-in-the-syrian-conflict/</citation>.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events prompted a hasty response from the Assad regime, which reinforced its positions around Aleppo and launched aerial bombardments in attempts to repel the insurgents. However, many inside the city reported minimal resistance from government troops during the initial clashes, suggesting that the regime was caught off guard <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/middleeast/syrian-rebels-control-aleppo-city-intl/index.html</citation>.\n\nThe wider implications of this offensive are profound. Rebel control over Aleppo reshapes the balance of power in Syria, challenging the long-standing dominance of the Assad regime, which has relied heavily on Russian air support and Iranian-backed militias. The latest developments indicate that the fighting could extend beyond Aleppo, with opposition forces pushing towards nearby provinces amidst ongoing fears of escalation from Assad and his allies, particularly Russia and Iran <citation>https://aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/29/rebel-groups-launch-attacks-on-syrias-aleppo-city</citation>.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2024 Battle of Aleppo is not merely a local conflict; it signals a potential resurgence in the capabilities of Syrian opposition forces and a critical juncture in the ongoing civil war, redefining territorial and political landscapes in a region marked by ongoing strife and shifting allegiances <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n</answer>"

        "value": "任务：写一个简短的2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n前面已写的内容：### Russia\n\nIn the wake of the significant offensive launched by Syrian opposition forces on November 27, 2024, Russia is facing a critical challenge to its longstanding support for the Assad regime. The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n## Analysis\n\nIn late November 2024, opposition forces in Syria launched a significant military offensive, marking one of the largest escalations in the ongoing conflict. The offensive, coordinated primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, targeted regime positions surrounding the city of Aleppo, resulting in the rapid capture of numerous towns and strategic areas. By early December 2024, these forces had reportedly advanced to within a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself, showcasing their ability to reclaim territory previously lost to government forces <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe operation, dubbed \"Deter Aggression,\" was characterized by a unified front among various opposition factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This coalition reflected a strategic shift amidst a backdrop of declining Assad regime capabilities, especially as external support from Russia and Iranian forces faced strain due to the shifting local dynamics. The Turkish government’s influence has been pivotal, with its enforcement of no-fly zones aiding opposition advances and preventing retaliatory strikes from the regime <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nAs the conflict intensified, over 178,000 individuals were displaced due to the hostilities, highlighting the dire humanitarian impact of the recent military operations. Major cities, particularly in the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, continue to experience strife as opposition forces seek to consolidate their gains and shift the balance of power within Syria. The implications of these developments may extend beyond local control, influencing regional relations and drawing the attention of international actors invested in the Syrian theater <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe fall of the Assad regime on December 8, 2024, after over 50 years of Baath Party rule, signals a potential turning point in the Syrian civil war. This new landscape poses both opportunities and challenges for the opposition as they navigate governance and military strategy in a post-Assad environment. The stakes of these shifts are high, as they could lead to the reconfiguration of power not just in Syria, but across the broader Middle Eastern region <citation>https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/syria</citation>.\n### Battle of Aleppo\n\nThe Battle of Aleppo in late November 2024 represents a significant turning point in the Syrian conflict, marking the first major rebel offensive that succeeded in breaching the city since its recapture by government forces in late 2016. The offensive, launched by opposition fighters from the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), primarily comprised elements of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other allied factions, rapidly advanced into Aleppo, capturing dozens of towns and crucial military installations within days <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nBeginning on November 27, 2024, the offensive surprised government forces, leading to a swift collapse of previously established battle lines. By November 30, numerous reports confirmed that opposition forces had gained control over large parts of Aleppo city, including the airport, marking a drastic shift in territorial control across the northwest, notably in provinces like Hama and Idlib <citation>https://www.ryanjhite.com/2024/12/03/the-fall-of-aleppo-2024-a-turning-point-in-the-syrian-conflict/</citation>.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events prompted a hasty response from the Assad regime, which reinforced its positions around Aleppo and launched aerial bombardments in attempts to repel the insurgents. However, many inside the city reported minimal resistance from government troops during the initial clashes, suggesting that the regime was caught off guard <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/middleeast/syrian-rebels-control-aleppo-city-intl/index.html</citation>.\n\nThe wider implications of this offensive are profound. Rebel control over Aleppo reshapes the balance of power in Syria, challenging the long-standing dominance of the Assad regime, which has relied heavily on Russian air support and Iranian-backed militias. The latest developments indicate that the fighting could extend beyond Aleppo, with opposition forces pushing towards nearby provinces amidst ongoing fears of escalation from Assad and his allies, particularly Russia and Iran <citation>https://aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/29/rebel-groups-launch-attacks-on-syrias-aleppo-city</citation>.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2024 Battle of Aleppo is not merely a local conflict; it signals a potential resurgence in the capabilities of Syrian opposition forces and a critical juncture in the ongoing civil war, redefining territorial and political landscapes in a region marked by ongoing strife and shifting allegiances <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Government withdrawal and SDF advances\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n## Analysis\n\nIn late November 2024, opposition forces in Syria launched a significant military offensive, marking one of the largest escalations in the ongoing conflict. The offensive, coordinated primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, targeted regime positions surrounding the city of Aleppo, resulting in the rapid capture of numerous towns and strategic areas. By early December 2024, these forces had reportedly advanced to within a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself, showcasing their ability to reclaim territory previously lost to government forces <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe operation, dubbed \"Deter Aggression,\" was characterized by a unified front among various opposition factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This coalition reflected a strategic shift amidst a backdrop of declining Assad regime capabilities, especially as external support from Russia and Iranian forces faced strain due to the shifting local dynamics. The Turkish government’s influence has been pivotal, with its enforcement of no-fly zones aiding opposition advances and preventing retaliatory strikes from the regime <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nAs the conflict intensified, over 178,000 individuals were displaced due to the hostilities, highlighting the dire humanitarian impact of the recent military operations. Major cities, particularly in the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, continue to experience strife as opposition forces seek to consolidate their gains and shift the balance of power within Syria. The implications of these developments may extend beyond local control, influencing regional relations and drawing the attention of international actors invested in the Syrian theater <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe fall of the Assad regime on December 8, 2024, after over 50 years of Baath Party rule, signals a potential turning point in the Syrian civil war. This new landscape poses both opportunities and challenges for the opposition as they navigate governance and military strategy in a post-Assad environment. The stakes of these shifts are high, as they could lead to the reconfiguration of power not just in Syria, but across the broader Middle Eastern region <citation>https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/syria</citation>.\n### Battle of Aleppo\n\nThe Battle of Aleppo in late November 2024 represents a significant turning point in the Syrian conflict, marking the first major rebel offensive that succeeded in breaching the city since its recapture by government forces in late 2016. The offensive, launched by opposition fighters from the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), primarily comprised elements of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other allied factions, rapidly advanced into Aleppo, capturing dozens of towns and crucial military installations within days <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nBeginning on November 27, 2024, the offensive surprised government forces, leading to a swift collapse of previously established battle lines. By November 30, numerous reports confirmed that opposition forces had gained control over large parts of Aleppo city, including the airport, marking a drastic shift in territorial control across the northwest, notably in provinces like Hama and Idlib <citation>https://www.ryanjhite.com/2024/12/03/the-fall-of-aleppo-2024-a-turning-point-in-the-syrian-conflict/</citation>.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events prompted a hasty response from the Assad regime, which reinforced its positions around Aleppo and launched aerial bombardments in attempts to repel the insurgents. However, many inside the city reported minimal resistance from government troops during the initial clashes, suggesting that the regime was caught off guard <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/middleeast/syrian-rebels-control-aleppo-city-intl/index.html</citation>.\n\nThe wider implications of this offensive are profound. Rebel control over Aleppo reshapes the balance of power in Syria, challenging the long-standing dominance of the Assad regime, which has relied heavily on Russian air support and Iranian-backed militias. The latest developments indicate that the fighting could extend beyond Aleppo, with opposition forces pushing towards nearby provinces amidst ongoing fears of escalation from Assad and his allies, particularly Russia and Iran <citation>https://aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/29/rebel-groups-launch-attacks-on-syrias-aleppo-city</citation>.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2024 Battle of Aleppo is not merely a local conflict; it signals a potential resurgence in the capabilities of Syrian opposition forces and a critical juncture in the ongoing civil war, redefining territorial and political landscapes in a region marked by ongoing strife and shifting allegiances <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Government withdrawal and SDF advances\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

As the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition is already due to be disbanded in Iraq, Turkish officials have been encouraging Syria's new leadership also to eventually take control of ISIS prisons and camps in Syria from the SDF.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: The Coming Fight for Syria | Royal United Services Institute\\nURL: https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/coming-fight-syria\\nCONTENT: 404: Page not found | Royal United Services Institute 404: Page not found Unfortunately the page you are looking for cannot be found.

As opposition forces, including the Kurdish-led SDF, gained momentum against President Bashar al-Assad's troops, the government's capacity to maintain control over key regions waned. This shift came amidst rapid advances by Syrian opposition fighters, notably in areas such as Aleppo and Hama, resulting in strategic withdrawals by regime forces.\n\nOn November 30, 2024, the Syrian military announced a temporary withdrawal of its troops from Aleppo in response to the opposition's surprise offensive led by rebel factions, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/syria-army-announce-temporary-troop-withdrawal-aleppo-rebel-assault-islamist-hayat-tahrir-al-sham/</citation>. Following this, by early December, opposition forces had succeeded in capturing significant territories, including complete control of Damascus for the first time in over a decade of conflict <citation>https://www.betterworld.info/politics/middle-east/syria/2024-opposition-attacks</citation>. This strategic collapse of government control has led to significant territorial gains for rebels, pushing the Assad regime further toward potential collapse.\n\nSimultaneously, the SDF has capitalized on the government's retreat, advancing into the eastern Deir ez-Zor province and areas previously dominated by Assad’s forces <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/syria-updates-assad-forces-lose-ground-on-multiple-fronts/live-70987337</citation>. U.S.-backed SDF forces have worked to secure their hold on northeastern Syria, frequently clashing with remaining government troops while simultaneously targeting remnants of the Islamic State <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/middle-east/diwan/2024/12/eastern-syria-after-assad?lang=en</citation>.\n\nThe combination of these factors illustrates a rapidly shifting landscape in the Syrian conflict, with the government increasingly faced with territorial losses and growing pressure from both opposition forces and the SDF. As 2024 progresses, the future of Assad’s regime hangs in the balance, with opposition advances threatening to alter the trajectory of the civil war significantly <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/assad-on-brink-of-collapse-as-opposition-advances-on-all-fronts/a-55226136</citation>.\n</answer>"

Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6.

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n## Analysis\n\nIn late November 2024, opposition forces in Syria launched a significant military offensive, marking one of the largest escalations in the ongoing conflict. The offensive, coordinated primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, targeted regime positions surrounding the city of Aleppo, resulting in the rapid capture of numerous towns and strategic areas. By early December 2024, these forces had reportedly advanced to within a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself, showcasing their ability to reclaim territory previously lost to government forces <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe operation, dubbed \"Deter Aggression,\" was characterized by a unified front among various opposition factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This coalition reflected a strategic shift amidst a backdrop of declining Assad regime capabilities, especially as external support from Russia and Iranian forces faced strain due to the shifting local dynamics. The Turkish government’s influence has been pivotal, with its enforcement of no-fly zones aiding opposition advances and preventing retaliatory strikes from the regime <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nAs the conflict intensified, over 178,000 individuals were displaced due to the hostilities, highlighting the dire humanitarian impact of the recent military operations. Major cities, particularly in the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, continue to experience strife as opposition forces seek to consolidate their gains and shift the balance of power within Syria. The implications of these developments may extend beyond local control, influencing regional relations and drawing the attention of international actors invested in the Syrian theater <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe fall of the Assad regime on December 8, 2024, after over 50 years of Baath Party rule, signals a potential turning point in the Syrian civil war. This new landscape poses both opportunities and challenges for the opposition as they navigate governance and military strategy in a post-Assad environment. The stakes of these shifts are high, as they could lead to the reconfiguration of power not just in Syria, but across the broader Middle Eastern region <citation>https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/syria</citation>.\n### Battle of Aleppo\n\nThe Battle of Aleppo in late November 2024 represents a significant turning point in the Syrian conflict, marking the first major rebel offensive that succeeded in breaching the city since its recapture by government forces in late 2016. The offensive, launched by opposition fighters from the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), primarily comprised elements of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other allied factions, rapidly advanced into Aleppo, capturing dozens of towns and crucial military installations within days <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nBeginning on November 27, 2024, the offensive surprised government forces, leading to a swift collapse of previously established battle lines. By November 30, numerous reports confirmed that opposition forces had gained control over large parts of Aleppo city, including the airport, marking a drastic shift in territorial control across the northwest, notably in provinces like Hama and Idlib <citation>https://www.ryanjhite.com/2024/12/03/the-fall-of-aleppo-2024-a-turning-point-in-the-syrian-conflict/</citation>.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events prompted a hasty response from the Assad regime, which reinforced its positions around Aleppo and launched aerial bombardments in attempts to repel the insurgents. However, many inside the city reported minimal resistance from government troops during the initial clashes, suggesting that the regime was caught off guard <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/middleeast/syrian-rebels-control-aleppo-city-intl/index.html</citation>.\n\nThe wider implications of this offensive are profound. Rebel control over Aleppo reshapes the balance of power in Syria, challenging the long-standing dominance of the Assad regime, which has relied heavily on Russian air support and Iranian-backed militias. The latest developments indicate that the fighting could extend beyond Aleppo, with opposition forces pushing towards nearby provinces amidst ongoing fears of escalation from Assad and his allies, particularly Russia and Iran <citation>https://aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/29/rebel-groups-launch-attacks-on-syrias-aleppo-city</citation>.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2024 Battle of Aleppo is not merely a local conflict; it signals a potential resurgence in the capabilities of Syrian opposition forces and a critical juncture in the ongoing civil war, redefining territorial and political landscapes in a region marked by ongoing strife and shifting allegiances <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n### Government Withdrawal and SDF Advances\n\nIn the ongoing conflict in Syria, 2024 has marked a significant turning point, particularly for the Syrian government forces and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). As opposition forces, including the Kurdish-led SDF, gained momentum against President Bashar al-Assad's troops, the government's capacity to maintain control over key regions waned. This shift came amidst rapid advances by Syrian opposition fighters, notably in areas such as Aleppo and Hama, resulting in strategic withdrawals by regime forces.\n\nOn November 30, 2024, the Syrian military announced a temporary withdrawal of its troops from Aleppo in response to the opposition's surprise offensive led by rebel factions, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/syria-army-announce-temporary-troop-withdrawal-aleppo-rebel-assault-islamist-hayat-tahrir-al-sham/</citation>. Following this, by early December, opposition forces had succeeded in capturing significant territories, including complete control of Damascus for the first time in over a decade of conflict <citation>https://www.betterworld.info/politics/middle-east/syria/2024-opposition-attacks</citation>. This strategic collapse of government control has led to significant territorial gains for rebels, pushing the Assad regime further toward potential collapse.\n\nSimultaneously, the SDF has capitalized on the government's retreat, advancing into the eastern Deir ez-Zor province and areas previously dominated by Assad’s forces <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/syria-updates-assad-forces-lose-ground-on-multiple-fronts/live-70987337</citation>. U.S.-backed SDF forces have worked to secure their hold on northeastern Syria, frequently clashing with remaining government troops while simultaneously targeting remnants of the Islamic State <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/middle-east/diwan/2024/12/eastern-syria-after-assad?lang=en</citation>.\n\nThe combination of these factors illustrates a rapidly shifting landscape in the Syrian conflict, with the government increasingly faced with territorial losses and growing pressure from both opposition forces and the SDF. As 2024 progresses, the future of Assad’s regime hangs in the balance, with opposition advances threatening to alter the trajectory of the civil war significantly <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/assad-on-brink-of-collapse-as-opposition-advances-on-all-fronts/a-55226136</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Background\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n## Analysis\n\nIn late November 2024, opposition forces in Syria launched a significant military offensive, marking one of the largest escalations in the ongoing conflict. The offensive, coordinated primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, targeted regime positions surrounding the city of Aleppo, resulting in the rapid capture of numerous towns and strategic areas. By early December 2024, these forces had reportedly advanced to within a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself, showcasing their ability to reclaim territory previously lost to government forces <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe operation, dubbed \"Deter Aggression,\" was characterized by a unified front among various opposition factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This coalition reflected a strategic shift amidst a backdrop of declining Assad regime capabilities, especially as external support from Russia and Iranian forces faced strain due to the shifting local dynamics. The Turkish government’s influence has been pivotal, with its enforcement of no-fly zones aiding opposition advances and preventing retaliatory strikes from the regime <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nAs the conflict intensified, over 178,000 individuals were displaced due to the hostilities, highlighting the dire humanitarian impact of the recent military operations. Major cities, particularly in the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, continue to experience strife as opposition forces seek to consolidate their gains and shift the balance of power within Syria. The implications of these developments may extend beyond local control, influencing regional relations and drawing the attention of international actors invested in the Syrian theater <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe fall of the Assad regime on December 8, 2024, after over 50 years of Baath Party rule, signals a potential turning point in the Syrian civil war. This new landscape poses both opportunities and challenges for the opposition as they navigate governance and military strategy in a post-Assad environment. The stakes of these shifts are high, as they could lead to the reconfiguration of power not just in Syria, but across the broader Middle Eastern region <citation>https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/syria</citation>.\n### Battle of Aleppo\n\nThe Battle of Aleppo in late November 2024 represents a significant turning point in the Syrian conflict, marking the first major rebel offensive that succeeded in breaching the city since its recapture by government forces in late 2016. The offensive, launched by opposition fighters from the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), primarily comprised elements of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other allied factions, rapidly advanced into Aleppo, capturing dozens of towns and crucial military installations within days <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nBeginning on November 27, 2024, the offensive surprised government forces, leading to a swift collapse of previously established battle lines. By November 30, numerous reports confirmed that opposition forces had gained control over large parts of Aleppo city, including the airport, marking a drastic shift in territorial control across the northwest, notably in provinces like Hama and Idlib <citation>https://www.ryanjhite.com/2024/12/03/the-fall-of-aleppo-2024-a-turning-point-in-the-syrian-conflict/</citation>.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events prompted a hasty response from the Assad regime, which reinforced its positions around Aleppo and launched aerial bombardments in attempts to repel the insurgents. However, many inside the city reported minimal resistance from government troops during the initial clashes, suggesting that the regime was caught off guard <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/middleeast/syrian-rebels-control-aleppo-city-intl/index.html</citation>.\n\nThe wider implications of this offensive are profound. Rebel control over Aleppo reshapes the balance of power in Syria, challenging the long-standing dominance of the Assad regime, which has relied heavily on Russian air support and Iranian-backed militias. The latest developments indicate that the fighting could extend beyond Aleppo, with opposition forces pushing towards nearby provinces amidst ongoing fears of escalation from Assad and his allies, particularly Russia and Iran <citation>https://aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/29/rebel-groups-launch-attacks-on-syrias-aleppo-city</citation>.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2024 Battle of Aleppo is not merely a local conflict; it signals a potential resurgence in the capabilities of Syrian opposition forces and a critical juncture in the ongoing civil war, redefining territorial and political landscapes in a region marked by ongoing strife and shifting allegiances <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n### Government Withdrawal and SDF Advances\n\nIn the ongoing conflict in Syria, 2024 has marked a significant turning point, particularly for the Syrian government forces and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). As opposition forces, including the Kurdish-led SDF, gained momentum against President Bashar al-Assad's troops, the government's capacity to maintain control over key regions waned. This shift came amidst rapid advances by Syrian opposition fighters, notably in areas such as Aleppo and Hama, resulting in strategic withdrawals by regime forces.\n\nOn November 30, 2024, the Syrian military announced a temporary withdrawal of its troops from Aleppo in response to the opposition's surprise offensive led by rebel factions, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/syria-army-announce-temporary-troop-withdrawal-aleppo-rebel-assault-islamist-hayat-tahrir-al-sham/</citation>. Following this, by early December, opposition forces had succeeded in capturing significant territories, including complete control of Damascus for the first time in over a decade of conflict <citation>https://www.betterworld.info/politics/middle-east/syria/2024-opposition-attacks</citation>. This strategic collapse of government control has led to significant territorial gains for rebels, pushing the Assad regime further toward potential collapse.\n\nSimultaneously, the SDF has capitalized on the government's retreat, advancing into the eastern Deir ez-Zor province and areas previously dominated by Assad’s forces <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/syria-updates-assad-forces-lose-ground-on-multiple-fronts/live-70987337</citation>. U.S.-backed SDF forces have worked to secure their hold on northeastern Syria, frequently clashing with remaining government troops while simultaneously targeting remnants of the Islamic State <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/middle-east/diwan/2024/12/eastern-syria-after-assad?lang=en</citation>.\n\nThe combination of these factors illustrates a rapidly shifting landscape in the Syrian conflict, with the government increasingly faced with territorial losses and growing pressure from both opposition forces and the SDF. As 2024 progresses, the future of Assad’s regime hangs in the balance, with opposition advances threatening to alter the trajectory of the civil war significantly <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/assad-on-brink-of-collapse-as-opposition-advances-on-all-fronts/a-55226136</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Background\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

By the beginning of the weekend, antigovernment forces had captured most of the major city of Aleppo, and by Sunday, they were in control of a broad stretch of land across the provinces of Hama, Idlib and Aleppo, in the west and northwest of Syria, according to the rebel-linked administration and a British-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Government troops loyal to the president have been trying to repel the rebels, rushing reinforcements to the battlefield, launching airstrikes and getting support from Russian fighter jets, the Observatory has said.

Resolving this dilemma requires the new Syrian government to take several steps, including: providing international guarantees not to deal with groups designated as terrorists; implementing effective policies to combat violent extremism and ensure the state’s monopoly on weapons; enhancing transparency in the management of international aid; and opening up to individuals from the civil political and opposition forces that have a role in running the government to rebuild international confidence and gradually lift economic sanctions.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: Israel's Actions 'Threaten Syria's Fragile Political Transition ...\\nURL: https://press.un.org/en/2025/sc16042.doc.htm\\nCONTENT: Israel’s Actions ‘Threaten Syria’s Fragile Political Transition’, Senior Official Tells Security Council, Calling on All States to Respect Country’s Sovereignty | Meetings Coverage and Press Releases Israel’s Actions ‘Threaten Syria’s Fragile Political Transition’, Senior Official Tells Security Council, Calling on All States to Respect Country’s Sovereignty “They are undoubtedly a threat to the peace and security of the entire region,” he stressed, calling on the international community — particularly the Council — to shoulder its legal and moral responsibility to pressure Israel to immediately cease its aggression and withdraw from all Syrian territory.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: What Comes Next?

This move represents the most substantial military action in the region in over four years, signaling a possible shift in the dynamics of the ongoing conflict. The offensive was led by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, primarily consisting of the Syrian National Army (SNA) and allied Islamist factions such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed to reclaim territory and challenge the Assad regime's hold, which had remained relatively stable following earlier offensives. By early December 2024, opposition forces had reportedly captured significant areas in the Aleppo countryside and were nearing the outskirts of Aleppo city itself <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/article/syria-civil-war.html</citation>. The ensuing clashes have resulted in substantial human displacement, with approximately 178,000 people reported to have fled due to the escalating hostilities <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe motivations for the timing of this offensive stem from weeks of escalating tensions characterized by daily skirmishes and aerial bombardments, indicating a breakdown of the fragile ceasefire that had been in place. The offensive not only seeks to change the current battlefield realities but also sends a strategic message to regional actors such as Turkey and Russia regarding the shifting power dynamics in Syria <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>. In addition, the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the need for food security amidst reduced market access have become paramount issues, complicating the situation further <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe international response has included renewed dialogues among Russia, Turkey, and Iran, highlighting the complex geopolitical landscape that accompanies the armed conflict. As the opposition gains ground, the stability of the Assad regime is increasingly in question, setting the stage for significant shifts in the Syrian political landscape as 2024 progresses <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n</answer>"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n## Analysis\n\nIn late November 2024, opposition forces in Syria launched a significant military offensive, marking one of the largest escalations in the ongoing conflict. The offensive, coordinated primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, targeted regime positions surrounding the city of Aleppo, resulting in the rapid capture of numerous towns and strategic areas. By early December 2024, these forces had reportedly advanced to within a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself, showcasing their ability to reclaim territory previously lost to government forces <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe operation, dubbed \"Deter Aggression,\" was characterized by a unified front among various opposition factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This coalition reflected a strategic shift amidst a backdrop of declining Assad regime capabilities, especially as external support from Russia and Iranian forces faced strain due to the shifting local dynamics. The Turkish government’s influence has been pivotal, with its enforcement of no-fly zones aiding opposition advances and preventing retaliatory strikes from the regime <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nAs the conflict intensified, over 178,000 individuals were displaced due to the hostilities, highlighting the dire humanitarian impact of the recent military operations. Major cities, particularly in the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, continue to experience strife as opposition forces seek to consolidate their gains and shift the balance of power within Syria. The implications of these developments may extend beyond local control, influencing regional relations and drawing the attention of international actors invested in the Syrian theater <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe fall of the Assad regime on December 8, 2024, after over 50 years of Baath Party rule, signals a potential turning point in the Syrian civil war. This new landscape poses both opportunities and challenges for the opposition as they navigate governance and military strategy in a post-Assad environment. The stakes of these shifts are high, as they could lead to the reconfiguration of power not just in Syria, but across the broader Middle Eastern region <citation>https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/syria</citation>.\n### Battle of Aleppo\n\nThe Battle of Aleppo in late November 2024 represents a significant turning point in the Syrian conflict, marking the first major rebel offensive that succeeded in breaching the city since its recapture by government forces in late 2016. The offensive, launched by opposition fighters from the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), primarily comprised elements of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other allied factions, rapidly advanced into Aleppo, capturing dozens of towns and crucial military installations within days <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nBeginning on November 27, 2024, the offensive surprised government forces, leading to a swift collapse of previously established battle lines. By November 30, numerous reports confirmed that opposition forces had gained control over large parts of Aleppo city, including the airport, marking a drastic shift in territorial control across the northwest, notably in provinces like Hama and Idlib <citation>https://www.ryanjhite.com/2024/12/03/the-fall-of-aleppo-2024-a-turning-point-in-the-syrian-conflict/</citation>.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events prompted a hasty response from the Assad regime, which reinforced its positions around Aleppo and launched aerial bombardments in attempts to repel the insurgents. However, many inside the city reported minimal resistance from government troops during the initial clashes, suggesting that the regime was caught off guard <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/middleeast/syrian-rebels-control-aleppo-city-intl/index.html</citation>.\n\nThe wider implications of this offensive are profound. Rebel control over Aleppo reshapes the balance of power in Syria, challenging the long-standing dominance of the Assad regime, which has relied heavily on Russian air support and Iranian-backed militias. The latest developments indicate that the fighting could extend beyond Aleppo, with opposition forces pushing towards nearby provinces amidst ongoing fears of escalation from Assad and his allies, particularly Russia and Iran <citation>https://aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/29/rebel-groups-launch-attacks-on-syrias-aleppo-city</citation>.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2024 Battle of Aleppo is not merely a local conflict; it signals a potential resurgence in the capabilities of Syrian opposition forces and a critical juncture in the ongoing civil war, redefining territorial and political landscapes in a region marked by ongoing strife and shifting allegiances <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n### Government Withdrawal and SDF Advances\n\nIn the ongoing conflict in Syria, 2024 has marked a significant turning point, particularly for the Syrian government forces and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). As opposition forces, including the Kurdish-led SDF, gained momentum against President Bashar al-Assad's troops, the government's capacity to maintain control over key regions waned. This shift came amidst rapid advances by Syrian opposition fighters, notably in areas such as Aleppo and Hama, resulting in strategic withdrawals by regime forces.\n\nOn November 30, 2024, the Syrian military announced a temporary withdrawal of its troops from Aleppo in response to the opposition's surprise offensive led by rebel factions, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/syria-army-announce-temporary-troop-withdrawal-aleppo-rebel-assault-islamist-hayat-tahrir-al-sham/</citation>. Following this, by early December, opposition forces had succeeded in capturing significant territories, including complete control of Damascus for the first time in over a decade of conflict <citation>https://www.betterworld.info/politics/middle-east/syria/2024-opposition-attacks</citation>. This strategic collapse of government control has led to significant territorial gains for rebels, pushing the Assad regime further toward potential collapse.\n\nSimultaneously, the SDF has capitalized on the government's retreat, advancing into the eastern Deir ez-Zor province and areas previously dominated by Assad’s forces <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/syria-updates-assad-forces-lose-ground-on-multiple-fronts/live-70987337</citation>. U.S.-backed SDF forces have worked to secure their hold on northeastern Syria, frequently clashing with remaining government troops while simultaneously targeting remnants of the Islamic State <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/middle-east/diwan/2024/12/eastern-syria-after-assad?lang=en</citation>.\n\nThe combination of these factors illustrates a rapidly shifting landscape in the Syrian conflict, with the government increasingly faced with territorial losses and growing pressure from both opposition forces and the SDF. As 2024 progresses, the future of Assad’s regime hangs in the balance, with opposition advances threatening to alter the trajectory of the civil war significantly <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/assad-on-brink-of-collapse-as-opposition-advances-on-all-fronts/a-55226136</citation>.\n## Background\n\nIn late November 2024, the Syrian opposition launched a significant offensive in the northwest, marked by their advance towards key cities including Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. This move represents the most substantial military action in the region in over four years, signaling a possible shift in the dynamics of the ongoing conflict. The offensive was led by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, primarily consisting of the Syrian National Army (SNA) and allied Islamist factions such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed to reclaim territory and challenge the Assad regime's hold, which had remained relatively stable following earlier offensives. By early December 2024, opposition forces had reportedly captured significant areas in the Aleppo countryside and were nearing the outskirts of Aleppo city itself <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/article/syria-civil-war.html</citation>. The ensuing clashes have resulted in substantial human displacement, with approximately 178,000 people reported to have fled due to the escalating hostilities <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe motivations for the timing of this offensive stem from weeks of escalating tensions characterized by daily skirmishes and aerial bombardments, indicating a breakdown of the fragile ceasefire that had been in place. The offensive not only seeks to change the current battlefield realities but also sends a strategic message to regional actors such as Turkey and Russia regarding the shifting power dynamics in Syria <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>. In addition, the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the need for food security amidst reduced market access have become paramount issues, complicating the situation further <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe international response has included renewed dialogues among Russia, Turkey, and Iran, highlighting the complex geopolitical landscape that accompanies the armed conflict. As the opposition gains ground, the stability of the Assad regime is increasingly in question, setting the stage for significant shifts in the Syrian political landscape as 2024 progresses <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Capture of Hama\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The rapid advances of rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have resulted in substantial territorial losses for the regime, including the pivotal city of Aleppo, prompting a notable shift in military operations and diplomatic engagements within the region.\n\nHistorically, Russia's military intervention in Syria, initiated in 2015, was aimed at stabilizing the Assad government and curbing the influence of Western powers in the region. However, the recent offensive, branded as “Operation Deterring Aggression,” has dramatically altered the battlefield dynamics. The coalition of opposition forces, including both Islamist and secular groups, mobilized a large number of fighters, overwhelming pro-government positions and effectively forcing the Assad regime into a defensive posture <citation>https://themedialine.org/top-stories/syrian-rebels-announce-fall-of-assad-regime-following-rapid-offensive/</citation>.\n\nIn response to the deteriorating situation, Russian military operations have intensified, with aerial bombardments increasing on rebel positions in northern Syria. Reports indicate that Syrian and Russian jets began a coordinated effort to regain lost ground, implementing airstrikes on opposition strongholds <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the opposition advance presents a daunting challenge. Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier assurances of long-term support for Assad are now being tested, as the Kremlin must reassess its strategic posture amidst rising tensions with Turkey and the shifting balance of power <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nThe implications of the opposition's offensive extend beyond immediate military concerns; they threaten to undermine Russia's broader geopolitical influence in the Middle East. There are indications that the loss of territory in Syria could negatively impact Moscow's leverage in negotiations with the United States and its relationships with regional powers, particularly Turkey and Iran, whose support is crucial for navigating the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/02/syria-aleppo-russia-hts-hezbollah-iran/</citation>. In summary, while Russia attempts to maintain its foothold in Syria amidst these troubling developments, the ongoing conflict underscores a pivotal inflection point for its strategic ambitions in the region and poses long-term questions about the future of its relationship with Syria's new political entities.\n## Offensive\n\nIn late 2024, the Syrian opposition launched one of the most significant military offensives in recent years, marking a turning point in the long-standing conflict. This extensive attack commenced on November 27, 2024, led primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), which encompasses various factions including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The aim was to reclaim territory in northwestern Syria, particularly around Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, areas that were crucial for both strategic and humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe offensive's early successes included the rapid capture of more than a dozen towns and villages, bringing opposition forces within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city. This advance was characterized by a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed regime positions along the western front of Aleppo. Observers noted that the regime forces, which had previously been fortified by Russian air support and reinforcements, struggled to mount a cohesive defense against the unexpectedly vigorous opposition maneuvers <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this military escalation coincided with a broader geopolitical landscape where the Assad regime's allies—Russia and Iran—were preoccupied with other regional commitments, thus limiting their ability to provide immediate assistance. The new levels of coordination among opposition factions demonstrated greater military capability and morale <citation>https://kajnews.com/requirements-evidence-at-periods/pm-index0.html</citation>.\n\nHumanitarian concerns have also been exacerbated by this escalation. Over 178,000 individuals have been displaced due to the renewed violence, leading to increased food insecurity as access to markets dwindled <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As opposition forces continue to exert pressure on regime-controlled territories, the ramifications for regional stability and humanitarian conditions in Syria remain critical.\n\nOverall, the 2024 offensive by the Syrian opposition signifies a bold move to change the status quo amidst a shifting balance of power, aiming not just for territorial gains but also to reassert influence and negotiate a new political reality in the post-Assad landscape <citation>https://www.hill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-what-to-know-about-sudden-rebel-gains-in-syrias-13-year-war-and-why-it-matters/</citation>.\n### 2024年叙利亚反对派进攻概述\n\n2024年，叙利亚的反对派力量发起了自2016年以来最大规模的军事进攻，旨在重新夺回被阿萨德政府控制的领土。此次进攻名为“震慑侵略行动”，于11月27日开始，参与的主要力量包括叙利亚国家军（SNA）、阿赫拉尔·沙姆（Ahrar al-Sham）和与基地组织有关的组织等，约有15,000名反对派战斗人员集结于西部的阿勒颇周边。反对派很快便占领了多个城镇，并迫近阿勒颇市，激烈的战斗导致了数十人伤亡 <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>。\n\n反对派的军事行动并没有受到单一力量的支持，而是利用了其间的不稳定局势。报道指出，随着袭击的展开，政府军试图通过空袭和增援部队来防止反对派的进一步推进。同时，由于以色列和其他外部力量的介入，叙利亚政府面临着前所未有的压力 <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>。\n\n到12月初，反对派已成功控制了阿勒颇的大部分区域，并在哈马和伊德利卜的部分地区也取得了进展。从人道主义角度来看，冲突的加剧导致了大约178,000人被迫离开家园，许多国际人道组织暂停了在阿勒颇的运营，从而 exacerbated 的生活条件 <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>。\n\n此次进攻不仅改变了叙利亚东北部地区的力量对比，也引起了包括土耳其和俄罗斯在内的多国的关注与干预。与阿萨德政权的关系愈发紧张，反对派的进展可能会导致地区力量的重大变化 <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>。同时，有评论指出，反对派的行动不仅是为了改变地面的力量对比，更是对未来叙利亚政局的重大宣示。\n\n总的来说，2024年的反对派进攻标志着叙利亚内战一个新的转折点，局势的进一步发展将对叙利亚的未来产生深远影响。\n### Clashes between SDF and opposition forces\n\nIn 2024, the conflict in Syria experienced a significant intensification, particularly involving clashes between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and various opposition factions, notably the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The dynamics of these confrontations were profoundly influenced by the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, including the recent collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nOne of the major flashpoints occurred in late November, particularly in the strategic city of Manbij, where SDF and SNA forces engaged in heavy fighting. Reports indicated that SDF-linked fighters attempted to repel advances from the SNA, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides; for instance, 16 SDF fighters were killed during the clashes according to military sources (<citation>https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/241220241</citation>). These skirmishes were particularly severe given the backdrop of ongoing SNA offensives in northern Syria, which sought to exploit the power vacuum following Assad's weakening.\n\nAdditionally, on December 8, 2024, clashes erupted again in Manbij, leading to a significant development where a local prison facility was breached, leading to the release of prisoners amidst the chaos (<citation>https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/814270</citation>). The situation was further complicated by an increase in ISIS activities in the region, as SDF commander Mazloum Abdi warned that the group's resurgence posed an acute threat in the context of these intra-opposition clashes and shifting alliances.\n\nThe preceding weeks had seen a broader offensive launched by opposition forces, which included elements from HTS, advancing towards Aleppo and Hama. The situation escalated dramatically as the SDF engaged not only with opposition fighters but also faced pressure from pro-government forces and Iranian-backed militias, primarily in Deir ez-Zor, where conflicting territorial claims led to violent encounters (<citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/clashes-between-arab-tribes-sdf-forces-syria-pose-challenge-us</citation>).\n\nThese clashes illustrate the fracturing landscape of Syrian warfare, highlighting how various factions are vying for control in a post-Assad era, often clashing with one another as they attempt to assert dominance over strategic territories. The ongoing violence underscores the complexity of the situation, where allegiances shift rapidly, and the potential for further escalations remains high, complicating efforts for any sustainable peace or stability in the region.\n### Domestic\n\nIn 2024, the Syrian opposition launched its largest offensive in years, significantly shifting the dynamics of the ongoing civil war. Spearheaded by diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the offensive commenced on November 27. Within days, these forces rapidly advanced, capturing key areas primarily in the northwestern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, with reports indicating the complete capture of Aleppo city by early December <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed not only to reclaim territories lost over the years but also to challenge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have been weakened amid ongoing conflicts with external powers and various other crises <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>. This bold maneuver forces Assad's allies, notably Russia and Iran, to reassess their strategies, as they are concurrently engaged in other regional conflicts <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nDespite initial successes, the regime has retaliated with intensified airstrikes against opposition-held areas, particularly targeting supply lines and re-establishing control over critical military installations <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl</citation>. Humanitarian conditions have deteriorated with mounting displacement, as approximately 178,000 people were forced to flee their homes due to the latest surge in violence, straining already limited resources and access to food <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe developments reflect a complex interplay of military strategies, external influences, and humanitarian crises, suggesting that the current phase of the Syrian conflict may lead to broader geopolitical ramifications, potentially altering the balance of power in the region <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n### Opening advances\n\nIn late November 2024, Syrian opposition forces launched a significant offensive dubbed \"Operation Deterring Aggression,\" marking one of the most ambitious efforts against the Assad regime in years. On November 27, a coalition of approximately 15,000 fighters comprised of various opposition groups initiated widespread attacks across multiple front-line positions, particularly in the western countryside of Aleppo <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nThe operational focus was on the strategic Aleppo region, where opposition forces quickly captured areas like New Aleppo and the Al-Muhafazah district, with relatively limited resistance from pro-regime fighters. This advance was characterized by quick tactical maneuvers, which limited street fighting and allowed some semblance of normal life to persist for local residents <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>.\n\nBy November 28, reports indicated that opposition fighters had breached the outskirts of Aleppo, entering the village of Anjara, which further illustrated the momentum of their advance <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-attack-clashes-aleppo-9c07da6f83036f34d4b18a479de9d085</citation>. The offensive was bolstered by various factions, including the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which played a crucial role in the strategic gains made across the region <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nAs the situation evolved, it became evident that the offensive indicated a shift in the balance of power, with the potential for significant regime losses and challenges to Assad’s administration. U.S. analysts speculated that this rapid advance of rebel forces could lead to a collapse of the Assad regime within days, a scenario that would dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/07/politics/assad-regime-syrian-civil-war/index</citation>.\n\nOverall, the opening advances of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive reflect a critical moment in the ongoing civil war, showcasing both the resilience of the opposition and the precarious position of the Assad regime as it faces unprecedented challenges from a united front of insurgent forces.\n### Iran\n\nAs of December 2024, Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict has undergone significant changes, particularly in light of recent military offensives by the Syrian opposition. Historically, Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, providing military support and backing through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and various allied militia groups. However, recent developments indicate a shift in dynamics as opposition forces have achieved significant advances, including the capture of key regions such as Aleppo and the northern areas of Syria.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, reports emerged confirming that Iran has pledged to continue its support for the Syrian government in response to opposition advances. Iranian leaders articulated their commitment to assist Assad's regime militarily, indicating that Tehran remains crucial in the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Syrian government amidst escalating pressure from opposition forces. Russian officials have also echoed this sentiment, declaring \"unconditional support\" for Assad, highlighting the intertwined interests of both nations in maintaining the regime's authority in Syria <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/7/where-does-iran-stand-on-syrias-fast-moving-conflict</citation>.\n\nDespite this backing, the effectiveness of Iran's support has come into question as its proxy forces have faced challenges on the battlefield. The withdrawal of many Iranian military personnel from Syria has raised concerns about Iran's ability to project power as it had previously done. Notably, recent media updates indicate that all Iranian military forces, including key civilian components, are in the process of being evacuated from Syria as opposition factions continue their offensive <citation>https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-december-11-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting following the escalation of rebel activities and the weakening of Iranian proxies. The Syrian opposition has effectively exploited weaknesses in Iranian-aligned forces, leading to gains that challenge Iran's long-standing influence in the region. As the opposition continues to capitalize on these developments, the consequences for Iranian interests in Syria could be profound, potentially reshaping the broader power dynamics in the Middle East <citation>https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/russia-syria-iran-israel-us-hezbollah/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, Iran remains committed to supporting the Assad regime despite facing mounting challenges due to the opposition's military successes and its own strategic withdrawals. The future of Iran's influence in Syria will depend not only on its immediate military interventions but also on how effectively it can adapt to the rapidly evolving situation in the region.\n### Turkey\n\nIn 2024, Turkey has positioned itself as a significant player in the evolving Syrian landscape, particularly following the recent rebel offensive that launched on November 27 against the Assad regime. This offensive, primarily led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and aligned groups, signifies a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, with Turkey's support representing both a strategic commitment and a calculated risk. Analysts describe this move as a \"gamble\" for Turkey, with potential rewards including greater influence over northern Syria and the ability to manage the complex dynamics of Kurdish forces along its border <citation>https://www.newarab.com/opinion/rebel-roulette-turkeys-gamble-syrian-opposition-offensive</citation>.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Syrian opposition since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011. Following the rapid advances of opposition forces, Turkey's political narrative has shifted to one where it can assert significant influence over the fate of Syria. As Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has weakened, the Turkish government sees this as an opportunity to reshape post-war Syria in alignment with its interests, which include curbing Kurdish autonomy and addressing its Syrian refugee crisis <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/amid-syrias-upheaval-how-will-turkey-benefit/a-71017654</citation>.\n\nTurkey's military presence in Syria remains substantial, particularly in areas previously held by various local factions. The Turkish forces have been increasingly active, primarily targeting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are viewed as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that Turkey designates as a terrorist organization <citation>https://apnews.com/article/syria-security-conference-turkey-pkk-sdf-kurds-ceac41eca1aed0f49975c897637d07e1</citation>. Despite not directly intervening in the latest offensive, Turkey's backing of rebel groups is evident and serves to consolidate its influence in newly liberated territories, particularly in the significant strongholds such as Aleppo and Hama <citation>https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-erdogan-backs-rebel-offensive-syria</citation>.\n\nLooking forward, Turkey is poised to play a pivotal role in Syria’s reconstruction and stability. Its leadership has called for a reconciliation between the Assad government and opposition forces, a strategy aimed at fostering a more manageable political environment, which may include facilitating dialogue between opposing factions <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html</citation>. Ultimately, Turkey’s involvement in the Syrian conflict in 2024 serves not only its national interest but also aims to establish a new order in Syria as the dust from this long-standing war finally begins to settle.\n### Closing Offensives\n\nAs 2024 came to a close, the landscape of the Syrian conflict shifted dramatically with the resurgence of opposition offensives targeting regime-held areas. Two primary operations, named Operation Deter Aggression and Operation Dawn of Freedom, facilitated the capture of over 237 locations, including key cities, towns, and military installations across northern Syria, particularly in Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama <citation>https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/special-syria-nov-26-dec-3-2024</citation>. This marked one of the most significant conquests by the Syrian opposition in years, fueled by a coalition of diverse factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and Islamist groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n\nThe offensives showcased a newly united front among rebel groups, capitalizing on vulnerabilities within the Assad regime's defensive capabilities. Reports indicated that as pro-regime forces struggled to maintain control, opposition fighters advanced with surprising coordination, capturing critical military assets and territory with relatively few clashes <citation>https://etanasyria.org/north-west-offensive-update-1-1-december-2024/</citation>. This effective strategy not only dealt a blow to regime forces but also aimed to alter the regional power dynamics, as evidenced by heightened diplomatic exchanges between Russia, Turkey, and Iran in response to the shifts on the ground <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nBy early December, the offensive had layered renewed pressure on Assad's regime, prompting retaliatory measures from Russia and Iranian militias, who were determined to reclaim lost ground <citation>https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/12/03/armed-opposition-forces-battle-syria-troops-near-key-city-of-hama-monitor</citation>. With ongoing clashes reported around significant regions such as Hama and Aleppo, the possibility of a fortified opposition presence became increasingly clear, setting the stage for an uncertain but pivotal chapter in Syria's protracted conflict <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>.\n\nThese developments attest to a critical moment for the Syrian opposition, one that could redefine governance and stability in areas previously dominated by the Assad regime. The implications, both regionally and globally, underscore the complexity of the ongoing conflict, as external actors like Turkey, Iran, and Russia jockey for influence amid a rapidly changing battlefield <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>.\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive marks a significant turning point in the ongoing civil conflict, characterized by the rapid territorial gains made by various opposition groups. From late November to early December 2024, opposition forces, predominantly led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), launched an aggressive campaign that resulted in the capture of key territories, including portions of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama provinces. These successes displaced approximately 178,000 individuals due to the hostilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the region <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe offensive effectively dismantled the status quo that had persisted since the Assad regime regained control over these areas several years prior. It is perceived not only as a military achievement but also as a challenge to the Assad regime's legitimacy as it exposes vulnerabilities in its control mechanisms. The loss of territorial control has compelled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to reconsider negotiations with both Turkey and the opposition, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape of the region <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/02/the-aleppo-offensive-the-shattering-of-the-status-quo-in-syria/</citation>.\n\nSimultaneously, the military success of the opposition has created a geopolitical vacuum that external actors, particularly Turkey and Russia, are keen to exploit. For Turkey, the offensive presents an opportunity to strengthen its influence in northern Syria while challenging Kurdish groups aligned with the U.S. On the other hand, Russia faces a strategic dilemma as its support for the Assad regime becomes increasingly complicated in light of the opposition's restored momentum <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and-challenge-russia</citation>.\n\nDespite these gains, the aftermath is marred by ongoing humanitarian concerns. Many humanitarian organizations have had to suspend operations in affected areas such as Aleppo due to security fears and logistical challenges, further straining the already critical food security situation <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>. As the dynamics of control shift and new fronts emerge, the implications of this offensive will resonate beyond Syria's borders, influencing regional stability and international relations in the Middle East.\n## Preface\n\nThe year 2024 marked a significant turning point in the ongoing Syrian conflict, characterized by a dramatic resurgence of opposition forces against the Assad regime. This year saw the commencement of a large-scale offensive initiated by various opposition factions, including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). On November 27, 2024, these groups launched what they termed Operation \"Deterring Aggression,\" initiating a rapid military campaign that successfully captured strategic territories across the northern provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. \n\nThe offensive unfolded with remarkable speed, enabling the opposition to capture pivotal locations and ultimately pushing to within just a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself. Reports indicated that regime forces, caught off-guard, struggled to mount an effective defense and were forced to regroup hastily amidst heavy losses. This newfound momentum among the opposition not only marked a significant territorial shift but also highlighted the evolving dynamics of international relations in the region, particularly concerning Russian and Iranian support for the Assad regime, which faced increasing challenges as diplomatic discussions intensified.\n\nBy early December, approximately 178,000 civilians had been displaced due to the renewed hostilities, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the region. Aid organizations reported a suspension of operations in many conflict-affected areas, particularly in Aleppo, due to the intensifying violence and reduced accessibility to crucial supplies. The strategic advancements made by the opposition have raised concerns among international observers, who warn that the repercussions of these developments could destabilize the fragile geopolitical balance in the region, prompting renewed military engagement from external actors.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2024, it is essential to understand the implications of these military offensives, not only for the immediate stakeholders within Syria but also for broader geopolitical relations as various powers reassess their strategies and commitments within this multifaceted conflict. The outcome of this struggle could potentially redefine the future of Syria and shape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East for years to come.\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus on December 8, 2024, marked a significant turning point in the Syrian Civil War and the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime, which had ruled for over 24 years. The offensive was led by a coalition of Syrian opposition forces, prominently featuring the Syrian Free Army and Islamist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The assault commenced in late November 2024 and proceeded with rapid advances towards the capital, ultimately culminating in the capture of Damascus after a brief but intense campaign.\n\nBeginning in the northern provinces, the opposition groups coordinated a strategic offensive that swiftly captured key cities and encircled remaining regime strongholds. By early December, Assad's forces were reported to be in retreat as opposition fighters penetrated the suburbs of Damascus and conducted assaults on the regime's defenses. On December 8, celebrations erupted across the city as rebels declared it \"liberated,\" marking the end of decades of authoritarian rule under the Assad family <citation>https://ummid.com/news/2024/december/08-12-2024/damascus-falls-bashar-al-assad-flees-syrian-opposition.html</citation>.\n\nReports indicated that Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia amidst the chaotic collapse of his government <citation>https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-civil-war-live-updates-rebels-damascus-president-bashar-al-assad-us-russia-101733615690016.html</citation>. In the aftermath of the fall, the new leadership from the opposition faces the monumental task of stabilizing the country, which is left in ruins from over a decade of conflict and violence. The situation remains fluid as various factions vie for control, and the international community watches closely to gauge the future of Syria following such a historic shift in power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis event not only signals a change in political power within Syria but also poses significant implications for the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Analysts have drawn parallels to other historic regime changes in the region, highlighting the potential for both stability and further conflict as various groups pursue their interests in the newly liberated Syria <citation>https://timelinedaily.com/west-asia/damascus-has-fallen-10-points</citation>.\n### Israel\n\nIn 2024, the conflict dynamics in Syria dramatically evolved as opposition forces launched significant offensives against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, affecting Israel's strategic interests in the region. The rebels, primarily organized under the banners of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA), undertook a lightning offensive that resulted in the capture of key territories, including areas in the northern city of Aleppo <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-in-syria-take-advantage-of-israels-successes-against-a-weakened-iran-axis/</citation>.\n\nIsrael has been monitoring these developments closely, understanding that the weakening of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Syria into Lebanon presented both an opportunity and a threat. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified their operations against Iranian and Hezbollah positions within Syria, claiming that their actions have inadvertently aided the opposition by destabilizing Assad’s allied forces <citation>https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/israel-monitors-syrian-offensive-as-rebels-advance/</citation>.\n\nDespite these developments, experts caution that Israel has a complex relationship with the various factions within the Syrian opposition. Israel has been historically apprehensive about supporting jihadist groups, which complicates its strategic calculations. However, as the Assad regime faces increasing threats, Israeli officials have expressed that it is in their interest to see both the regime and opposition forces weaken each other, thereby promoting a form of regional stability advantageous to Israeli security <citation>https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-chiefs-discuss-syria-fighting-as-rebel-advance-said-to-exceed-expectations/</citation>. \n\nMoreover, the dynamics of the conflict in Syria have raised concerns that an unstable and fragmented Syrian state could lead to increased hostility towards Israel from various factions, potentially rekindling direct hostilities <citation>https://www.jns.org/analysis-of-syrias-current-conflict-and-its-implications-for-israel/</citation>. As the year progresses, Israel is not only concerned with the immediate implications of these offensives but also with the long-term geopolitical shift occurring in Syria, which could significantly adjust their strategy in the region <citation>https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/why-israel-escalating-its-strikes-against-syria</citation>.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensive on Israel remains to be seen, but the current trajectory suggests that the conflict will continued to shape Israeli defense policies and military strategies in the near future.\n### International\n\nThe recent offensive by Syrian opposition forces in 2024 has significantly altered the geopolitical landscape in Syria, drawing varied international responses. Following the unexpected capture of Damascus on December 8, 2024, by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a series of discussions and actions by major global players ensued, reflecting their interests in the evolving dynamics of the region.\n\nTurkey has played a pivotal role in supporting opposition forces, particularly the Syrian National Army (SNA), amidst its historical animosity toward the Assad regime. As the conflict escalated, Turkish officials engaged diplomatically with Russia and Iran, signaling an attempt to balance their strategic interests while ensuring the security of Turkey’s southern border against Kurdish forces and potential resurgence of Assad-aligned factions <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, faces a dilemma as its long-standing support for the Assad regime is threatened by the rapid gains of opposition forces. In the face of these developments, Moscow’s response has included intensified military cooperation with Iran and Hezbollah to bolster the regime <citation>https://www.csis.org/analysis/syrian-rebels-surprise-offensive-highlights-assad-regimes-weakness</citation>. The shifting dynamics may compel Russia to reassess its strategies, particularly with its resources stretched thin due to conflicts elsewhere, such as the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States, while still maintaining a military presence in northeastern Syria, has been cautious in its approach. This new phase of the conflict may open avenues for negotiations that could pressure the Assad regime to engage in dialogue regarding governance and humanitarian concerns, potentially aligning U.S. interests with those of regional actors seeking stability and a reduction in hostilities <citation>https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2024/12/08/syrias-civil-war-what-is-going-on-and-who-is-involved-in-this-rapidly-changing-situation/</citation>.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Gulf states have begun recalibrating their foreign policies in response to this new reality in Syria. With the HTS asserting greater control and diplomatic efforts from countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE aimed at establishing better relations with the opposition, the regional balance of power is shifting <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/the-gulf-shifts-policies-in-response-to-the-new-syria?lang=en</citation>.\n\nAs Syria stands at a crossroads, the international response will be crucial in determining not only the immediate outcome of the conflict but also the long-term governance and reconstruction efforts in a post-Assad era. The complexity of the situation demands nuanced strategies from all involved parties to navigate the uncertain future of Syria and its impact on regional and global stability <citation>https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158021</citation>.\n## Analysis\n\nIn late November 2024, opposition forces in Syria launched a significant military offensive, marking one of the largest escalations in the ongoing conflict. The offensive, coordinated primarily by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, targeted regime positions surrounding the city of Aleppo, resulting in the rapid capture of numerous towns and strategic areas. By early December 2024, these forces had reportedly advanced to within a few kilometers of Aleppo city itself, showcasing their ability to reclaim territory previously lost to government forces <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe operation, dubbed \"Deter Aggression,\" was characterized by a unified front among various opposition factions, including the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This coalition reflected a strategic shift amidst a backdrop of declining Assad regime capabilities, especially as external support from Russia and Iranian forces faced strain due to the shifting local dynamics. The Turkish government’s influence has been pivotal, with its enforcement of no-fly zones aiding opposition advances and preventing retaliatory strikes from the regime <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nAs the conflict intensified, over 178,000 individuals were displaced due to the hostilities, highlighting the dire humanitarian impact of the recent military operations. Major cities, particularly in the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, continue to experience strife as opposition forces seek to consolidate their gains and shift the balance of power within Syria. The implications of these developments may extend beyond local control, influencing regional relations and drawing the attention of international actors invested in the Syrian theater <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe fall of the Assad regime on December 8, 2024, after over 50 years of Baath Party rule, signals a potential turning point in the Syrian civil war. This new landscape poses both opportunities and challenges for the opposition as they navigate governance and military strategy in a post-Assad environment. The stakes of these shifts are high, as they could lead to the reconfiguration of power not just in Syria, but across the broader Middle Eastern region <citation>https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/syria</citation>.\n### Battle of Aleppo\n\nThe Battle of Aleppo in late November 2024 represents a significant turning point in the Syrian conflict, marking the first major rebel offensive that succeeded in breaching the city since its recapture by government forces in late 2016. The offensive, launched by opposition fighters from the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room (FM), primarily comprised elements of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other allied factions, rapidly advanced into Aleppo, capturing dozens of towns and crucial military installations within days <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nBeginning on November 27, 2024, the offensive surprised government forces, leading to a swift collapse of previously established battle lines. By November 30, numerous reports confirmed that opposition forces had gained control over large parts of Aleppo city, including the airport, marking a drastic shift in territorial control across the northwest, notably in provinces like Hama and Idlib <citation>https://www.ryanjhite.com/2024/12/03/the-fall-of-aleppo-2024-a-turning-point-in-the-syrian-conflict/</citation>.\n\nThis unexpected turn of events prompted a hasty response from the Assad regime, which reinforced its positions around Aleppo and launched aerial bombardments in attempts to repel the insurgents. However, many inside the city reported minimal resistance from government troops during the initial clashes, suggesting that the regime was caught off guard <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/middleeast/syrian-rebels-control-aleppo-city-intl/index.html</citation>.\n\nThe wider implications of this offensive are profound. Rebel control over Aleppo reshapes the balance of power in Syria, challenging the long-standing dominance of the Assad regime, which has relied heavily on Russian air support and Iranian-backed militias. The latest developments indicate that the fighting could extend beyond Aleppo, with opposition forces pushing towards nearby provinces amidst ongoing fears of escalation from Assad and his allies, particularly Russia and Iran <citation>https://aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/29/rebel-groups-launch-attacks-on-syrias-aleppo-city</citation>.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2024 Battle of Aleppo is not merely a local conflict; it signals a potential resurgence in the capabilities of Syrian opposition forces and a critical juncture in the ongoing civil war, redefining territorial and political landscapes in a region marked by ongoing strife and shifting allegiances <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/syria-opposition-forces-bases.html</citation>.\n### Government Withdrawal and SDF Advances\n\nIn the ongoing conflict in Syria, 2024 has marked a significant turning point, particularly for the Syrian government forces and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). As opposition forces, including the Kurdish-led SDF, gained momentum against President Bashar al-Assad's troops, the government's capacity to maintain control over key regions waned. This shift came amidst rapid advances by Syrian opposition fighters, notably in areas such as Aleppo and Hama, resulting in strategic withdrawals by regime forces.\n\nOn November 30, 2024, the Syrian military announced a temporary withdrawal of its troops from Aleppo in response to the opposition's surprise offensive led by rebel factions, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/syria-army-announce-temporary-troop-withdrawal-aleppo-rebel-assault-islamist-hayat-tahrir-al-sham/</citation>. Following this, by early December, opposition forces had succeeded in capturing significant territories, including complete control of Damascus for the first time in over a decade of conflict <citation>https://www.betterworld.info/politics/middle-east/syria/2024-opposition-attacks</citation>. This strategic collapse of government control has led to significant territorial gains for rebels, pushing the Assad regime further toward potential collapse.\n\nSimultaneously, the SDF has capitalized on the government's retreat, advancing into the eastern Deir ez-Zor province and areas previously dominated by Assad’s forces <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/syria-updates-assad-forces-lose-ground-on-multiple-fronts/live-70987337</citation>. U.S.-backed SDF forces have worked to secure their hold on northeastern Syria, frequently clashing with remaining government troops while simultaneously targeting remnants of the Islamic State <citation>https://carnegieendowment.org/middle-east/diwan/2024/12/eastern-syria-after-assad?lang=en</citation>.\n\nThe combination of these factors illustrates a rapidly shifting landscape in the Syrian conflict, with the government increasingly faced with territorial losses and growing pressure from both opposition forces and the SDF. As 2024 progresses, the future of Assad’s regime hangs in the balance, with opposition advances threatening to alter the trajectory of the civil war significantly <citation>https://www.dw.com/en/assad-on-brink-of-collapse-as-opposition-advances-on-all-fronts/a-55226136</citation>.\n## Background\n\nIn late November 2024, the Syrian opposition launched a significant offensive in the northwest, marked by their advance towards key cities including Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama. This move represents the most substantial military action in the region in over four years, signaling a possible shift in the dynamics of the ongoing conflict. The offensive was led by the Fatah Mubin Joint Operations Room, primarily consisting of the Syrian National Army (SNA) and allied Islamist factions such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) <citation>https://www.syriarevisited.com/p/deterrence-of-aggression-implications</citation>.\n\nThe offensive aimed to reclaim territory and challenge the Assad regime's hold, which had remained relatively stable following earlier offensives. By early December 2024, opposition forces had reportedly captured significant areas in the Aleppo countryside and were nearing the outskirts of Aleppo city itself <citation>https://www.nytimes.com/article/syria-civil-war.html</citation>. The ensuing clashes have resulted in substantial human displacement, with approximately 178,000 people reported to have fled due to the escalating hostilities <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe motivations for the timing of this offensive stem from weeks of escalating tensions characterized by daily skirmishes and aerial bombardments, indicating a breakdown of the fragile ceasefire that had been in place. The offensive not only seeks to change the current battlefield realities but also sends a strategic message to regional actors such as Turkey and Russia regarding the shifting power dynamics in Syria <citation>https://gcclub.org/2024/12/02/syrias-rebel-offensive-why-now-and-what-could-happen-next/</citation>. In addition, the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the need for food security amidst reduced market access have become paramount issues, complicating the situation further <citation>https://www.acaps.org/fileadmin/Data_Product/Main_media/20241206_ACAPS_Briefing_note_Syria_escalation_of_conflict_in_the_northwest.pdf</citation>.\n\nThe international response has included renewed dialogues among Russia, Turkey, and Iran, highlighting the complex geopolitical landscape that accompanies the armed conflict. As the opposition gains ground, the stability of the Assad regime is increasingly in question, setting the stage for significant shifts in the Syrian political landscape as 2024 progresses <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Capture of Hama\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

This offensive, which began with a rapid series of assaults, saw opposition fighters entering Hama on December 3, following their prior success in seizing Aleppo just days earlier. The capture of Hama represents a considerable blow to Assad's control, as the city had been a stronghold of his government for over a decade.\n\nThe offensive was spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist militia that has become a leading force in the Syrian opposition. On December 6, the group announced their successful entry into the central districts of Hama, emphasizing the strategic importance of the city, located approximately 110 kilometers south of Aleppo and historically significant in the context of the Syrian conflict. HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani framed the capture as a mission to \"cleanse the wound that has persisted in Syria for forty years,\" alluding to the longstanding rule of the Assad family and the repression experienced by opposition forces over the years <citation>https://kansaspublicradio.org/npr-news/2024-12-05/syrian-opposition-forces-enter-the-key-city-of-hama-in-a-new-blow-to-assads-regime</citation>.\n\nIn swift coordination, various rebel factions pooled their resources, resulting in the government's forces retreating under pressure. The opposition's victory in Hama underscores how recent military strategies, along with changing dynamics on the ground, have shifted the balance in the conflict. International observers noted that the fall of Hama could herald significant implications for the regime's stability, with speculation about its potential collapse gaining traction <citation>https://www.newsweek.com/hama-falls-insurgents-major-blow-assad-regime-1995936</citation><citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/5/syrian-opposition-fighters-claim-to-have-entered-the-crucial-city-of-hama</citation>.\n\nThe battle for Hama involved fierce confrontations as government forces attempted to mount a determined defense but ultimately could not contain the opposition's rapid advance. This loss not only diminishes Assad's territorial control but also emboldens opposition groups, furthering their quest to challenge the regime decisively <citation>https://www.bbc.org/news/articles/cql5r2px4yyo</citation><citation>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/syria-insurgents-hama-capture_n_67527927e4b0a7189dd8ce71</citation>. \n\nIn summary, the capture of Hama signals a critical juncture in the Syrian civil war. It highlights the shifting tide against the Assad regime and could potentially lead to further destabilization in Syria as opposition forces gain momentum and territory.<citation>https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/world/middleeast/syria-rebel-offensive-hama.html</citation>\n</answer>"

    "system": "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question. \\\nYou can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.\n\n## Tool Use Formatting\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Execute safe mathematical expressions.\\n\\nSupports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **) and common mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc.).\\nFor security reasons, only mathematical expressions are allowed, no arbitrary code execution.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Mathematical expression to calculate, e.g., \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\", \\\"sin(30 * pi / 180)\\\", \\\"sqrt(16)\\\"\"}}, \"required\": [\"expression\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n",
