The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) conducts voter registration, often announcing general registration periods <citation>https://www.gov.bw/voting/voter-registration</citation>. During these periods, citizens can visit a Registration Officer with their Omang, who will then complete a registration form <citation>https://www.gov.bw/voting/voter-registration</citation>.\n\nFor the 2024 general elections, voter registration commenced on January 5 and concluded on February 3, 2024 <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/iec-records-a-decline-in-registered-voters/news</citation>, <citation>https://newsinvasion24.com/botswana-wraps-up-voter-registration-for-2024-elections/</citation>.

The election marked the first time Mokgweetsi Masisi led the BDP as president, having succeeded Ian Khama in 2018 <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20191023/</citation>.\n\nThe BDP's popular vote surged from 46.7% to 66.66% in the 2019 election <citation>https://www.politicalanalysis.co.za/botswanas-ruling-party-wins-37-of-the-57-parliamentary-seats/</citation>, allowing them to retain a majority in the 65-member National Assembly with 38 of the 57 seats at stake <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20191023/</citation>.\n\nThe 2019 election was significantly influenced by former President Ian Khama <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03057070.2020.1778901</citation>. In the run-up to the election, a power struggle erupted within the ruling BDP <citation>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/botswana/politics-2019.htm</citation>, and Khama, who left the ruling party, backed the opposition <citation>https://mg.co.za/article/2019-10-17-khamas-hand-still-rocks-botswana/</citation>.\n\nThe 2019 Botswana elections were marred by allegations of irregularity <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/udc-working-on-strategies-to-prevent-election-rigging/news</citation>. Forensics for Justice claimed to have evidence that the election was fraudulently rigged to favor the BDP, allegedly assisted by intelligence services <citation>https://www.biznews.com/global-citizen/2019/12/05/botswana-election-rigged-forensics-justice</citation>. The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) also made claims of poll rigging ahead of the election <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-electoral-body-warns-opposition-about-rigging-claims/7826626.html</citation>. Following the elections, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) faced numerous legal challenges in the form of election petitions due to the non-acceptance of election results <citation>https://www.iec.gov.bw/images/Stakeholders+REPORT_Feb+26+2021.pdf</citation>. The UDC challenged the election results in court for 16 parliamentary constituencies won by the BDP <citation>https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/botswana-opposition-challenges-election-result-in-court-2019-11-26</citation>.\n\nThe African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) was deployed to Botswana for the 2019 general election <citation>https://www.eisa.org/pdf/bot2019au.pdf</citation> and commended the IEC for providing voter information on Election Day, such as displaying names and symbols of contesting parties and independent candidates at polling stations <citation>https://www.eisa.org/pdf/bot2019au.pdf</citation>.\n</answer>"

This task is carried out by the Delimitation Commission, which is appointed by the Judicial Service Commission following the receipt of the National Population Census Report <citation>https://enews.mmegi.bw/article/281535114590127</citation>.\n\nThe Delimitation Commission, established on May 13, 2022, and sworn in on May 27, 2022 <citation>https://www.botswanayouth.com/delimination-commission-hands-over-report-to-president-masisi/</citation>, undertakes extensive consultations to gather input from various stakeholders.

The presidential nomination court convened on September 28, 2024, at the Gaborone High Court <citation>https://povonews.com/botswanas-2024-general-elections-to-be-held-on-october-30/</citation>. The Chief Justice of Botswana serves as the returning officer for presidential elections, as stipulated by Sections 32 and 38 of the Constitution and Section 2 of the Presidential Elections Act <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/77718</citation>.\n\nHowever, Biggie Butale, leader of the Botswana Republican Party (BRP), failed to meet the legal requirements for nomination and was therefore not confirmed as a presidential candidate <citation>https://yourbotswana.com/2024/10/01/botswana-leader-3-from-opposition-confirmed-as-presidential-candidates/</citation>, <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82038</citation>.\n</answer>"

This will also create a cohesive narrative about the integrity of the electoral process. I will also need to include the presence of the African Union Election Observation Mission to ensure a fair election.</thought>\n<answer>\n### Observation controversy\n\nThe 2024 Botswana general election was not without controversy, particularly concerning the observation of the electoral process. The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) took the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to court, which led to postponements of voter registration in November, as the UDC sought permission to deploy registration observers <citation>https://trendsnafrica.com/voter-registration-for-2024-general-elections-starts-in-botswana/</citation>. This legal challenge underscores the importance the UDC placed on ensuring transparency and preventing potential irregularities during voter registration.\n\nClaims of poll rigging have also been a recurring concern. In 2019, the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) made claims of poll rigging ahead of the general election, which Botswana’s election commission warned against <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-electoral-body-warns-opposition-about-rigging-claims/7826626.html</citation>. These allegations highlight the need for robust oversight and impartial monitoring to maintain public trust in the electoral system.\n\nTo ensure a fair and transparent election, the African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) was deployed to Botswana for the 2019 general election following an invitation from the Government of Botswana and the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) <citation>https://www.eisa.org/pdf/bot2019au.pdf</citation>. The AUEOM's presence and engagement with various stakeholders, including the IEC, political parties, candidates, and civil society, played a crucial role in promoting confidence in the electoral process.\n</answer>"
