Overall, the political landscape shows significant shifts, indicating a more fragmented and polarized electoral environment compared to previous elections.\n\nThe opposing right-wing parties, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and Vlaams Belang (VB), have emerged as dominant forces in the Flemish region. Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang is vying for the top position, with estimates indicating they could capture approximately 27% of the vote, potentially outpacing N-VA, which is projected to secure around 20.9%<citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>. This rise for Vlaams Belang is attributed to its strong stance on migration issues, resonating particularly well with Flemish voters<citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>.\n\nIn the Francophone regions, the Reformist Movement (MR) and the Socialist Party (PS) are similarly engaged in a competitive race, reflecting dynamics influenced heavily by local issues and party strategies. Recent polling data indicate MR with around 27.4% and PS at 24.6%, signaling a tight contest for dominance in Wallonia and Brussels<citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/institute/ipsos</citation>.\n\nThe growing influence of populist radical parties is noteworthy. Both Vlaams Belang and the Workers' Party of Belgium (PTB/PVDA) are seen as significant political players, with the latter attracting attention for its appealing platform among left-leaning voters. A poll indicated that PTB is securing approximately 12.9% of the vote nationally, showcasing its strength in the context of the broader leftist political coalition< citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls</citation>.\n\nAs election day nears, the results from these polls will play a crucial role in shaping the strategies of the major parties. Coalition-building efforts post-election are expected to be complex, as various parties will need to negotiate effectively to form a stable government amidst a potentially fragmented parliament.<citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1086236/belgium-in-brief-election-upsets-and-what-happens-next</citation> \n\nIn summary, the opinion polls illustrate a changing political landscape in Belgium, marked by a rising right, particularly in Flanders, and a competitive race among the traditional major parties in the Francophone regions, setting the stage for the upcoming federal elections."

Various organizations conduct surveys to gauge voter intentions, offering a snapshot of the political sentiments prevalent in different regions of Belgium.\n\n### Current Polling Data\n\nRecent polling data indicate a strong showing for the far-right party, Vlaams Belang (VB), which has emerged as a significant force in the Flemish region. As of the latest surveys, VB is projected to capture approximately **26%** of the Flemish vote, closely followed by the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) with **20.9%** and the Workers' Party (PTB/PVDA) at **12.2%** <citation>https://robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>. This marks a notable shift in voter sentiment, particularly in a landscape that has historically favored more centrist parties.\n\nIn Brussels, the Reformist Movement (MR) is showing promising results, with a polling percentage around **27.4%**, placing it ahead of the Socialist Party (PS) at **24.6%** <citation>https://brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1023133/bouchezs-liberals-surge-back-ahead-in-brussels-in-latest-polls</citation>.\n\n### Implications of the Polls\n\nThe results of these polls suggest a potential realignment of political power within Belgium. If VB and N-VA can maintain their momentum, they may significantly influence the formation of the federal government post-elections. The rise in support for populist and right-wing parties reflects broader trends seen across Europe, where similar parties are gaining traction.\n\nMoreover, with the upcoming elections being pivotal not only for the federal level but also for regional and European parliamentary seats, the implications of these polling results extend far beyond national boundaries. They may reshape coalition possibilities and governance in Belgium for years to come, especially amid the backdrop of pressing issues such as migration and economic recovery.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs Belgium heads towards the June 2024 federal elections, the landscape indicated by opinion polls suggests a competitive and potentially transformative electoral process. Key parties like VB and N-VA are positioned to play influential roles, and the dynamic nature of voter preferences will likely drive coalition negotiations in the aftermath of the election. Continuous monitoring of polling data will be essential in understanding the evolving political scene in Belgium <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls</citation>.\n</answer>"

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件，要求简单清晰即可\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election will see the French-speaking constituency play a critical role in the political landscape of Belgium. Comprising the Walloon region and certain Brussels municipalities, the French-speaking electoral college will elect representatives based on the preferences of its constituents.\n\nIn this election, there are a total of 8 seats allocated to the French-speaking constituency. The voting dynamics are notably influenced by the demographics of the region, where multiple French-speaking parties vie for influence. Key players include the Francophone Liberal Reformist Party (MR) and the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), which are expected to compete fiercely for voter support. Recent polling indicates that these parties are neck-and-neck, each capturing close to 22% of the electoral preferences, suggesting a highly competitive environment leading up to the election <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n\nBrussels, which has a significant French-speaking population, adds another layer to the electoral process, as voters from six municipalities can choose candidates from French-speaking lists. This unique characteristic of the electoral system allows for a nuanced representation of the French-speaking community and reflects Belgium's linguistic diversity <citation>https://elections.europa.eu/en/how-to-vote/be/</citation>.\n\nThe results of the election may lead to significant implications for coalition formations at the federal level. The previous coalition, comprising major French-speaking parties, is under scrutiny as both the political context and voter sentiments evolve. The potential return of a right-leaning coalition is also a factor to be considered <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nAs such, the French-speaking constituencies' outcomes are pivotal not only for local governance but also for the broader political direction of Belgium in the coming years.\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal elections approach, opinion polls are playing a crucial role in shaping the political landscape. Various organizations conduct surveys to gauge voter intentions, offering a snapshot of the political sentiments prevalent in different regions of Belgium.\n\n### Current Polling Data\n\nRecent polling data indicate a strong showing for the far-right party, Vlaams Belang (VB), which has emerged as a significant force in the Flemish region. As of the latest surveys, VB is projected to capture approximately **26%** of the Flemish vote, closely followed by the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) with **20.9%** and the Workers' Party (PTB/PVDA) at **12.2%** <citation>https://robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>. This marks a notable shift in voter sentiment, particularly in a landscape that has historically favored more centrist parties.\n\nIn Brussels, the Reformist Movement (MR) is showing promising results, with a polling percentage around **27.4%**, placing it ahead of the Socialist Party (PS) at **24.6%** <citation>https://brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1023133/bouchezs-liberals-surge-back-ahead-in-brussels-in-latest-polls</citation>.\n\n### Implications of the Polls\n\nThe results of these polls suggest a potential realignment of political power within Belgium. If VB and N-VA can maintain their momentum, they may significantly influence the formation of the federal government post-elections. The rise in support for populist and right-wing parties reflects broader trends seen across Europe, where similar parties are gaining traction.\n\nMoreover, with the upcoming elections being pivotal not only for the federal level but also for regional and European parliamentary seats, the implications of these polling results extend far beyond national boundaries. They may reshape coalition possibilities and governance in Belgium for years to come, especially amid the backdrop of pressing issues such as migration and economic recovery.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs Belgium heads towards the June 2024 federal elections, the landscape indicated by opinion polls suggests a competitive and potentially transformative electoral process. Key parties like VB and N-VA are positioned to play influential roles, and the dynamic nature of voter preferences will likely drive coalition negotiations in the aftermath of the election. Continuous monitoring of polling data will be essential in understanding the evolving political scene in Belgium <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Background\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

This election was characterized by notably low voter turnout, the lowest recorded since compulsory voting was established in 1893, reflecting a growing disconnect between the electorate and the political framework <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn the lead-up to the elections, a significant shift was observed towards the right in the political spectrum. The far-right party, Vlaams Belang (VB), was anticipated to perform strongly, with projections suggesting they could secure around 27% of the votes in Flanders. This was indicative of a broader trend across Europe where populist and nationalist sentiments have surged <citation>https://apnews.com/article/eu-belgium-elections-far-right-left-151765c619da911898b058e83f2f8ea4</citation>.\n\nThe primary issues that dominated the campaign included migration, socio-economic reforms, and public financial management. The nature of public discourse, especially in Flanders, was heavily focused on migration, which benefitted the Vlaams Belang as it has positioned itself as a staunch opponent of immigration <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>. Concurrently, the Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) gained traction among the French-speaking population, reflecting a divergence in priorities between the two linguistic regions <citation>https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/16/in-belgium-stupefaction-after-federal-parliamentary-elections_6674912_4.html</citation>.\n\nThe aftermath of the elections saw complex coalition negotiations unfold, typical in Belgian politics, due to the fragmented parliamentary landscape. Various coalitions were suggested, including a revival of the centre-right \"Swedish\" coalition and the potential for more unorthodox alliances given the shift in party strengths <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the 2024 elections showcased a pivotal and contentious period in Belgian politics, with rising right-wing sentiments and significant challenges in coalition building, setting the stage for how the government will address pressing national issues moving forward.\n</answer>"

Various organizations conduct surveys to gauge voter intentions, offering a snapshot of the political sentiments prevalent in different regions of Belgium.\n\n### Current Polling Data\n\nRecent polling data indicate a strong showing for the far-right party, Vlaams Belang (VB), which has emerged as a significant force in the Flemish region. As of the latest surveys, VB is projected to capture approximately **26%** of the Flemish vote, closely followed by the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) with **20.9%** and the Workers' Party (PTB/PVDA) at **12.2%** <citation>https://robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>. This marks a notable shift in voter sentiment, particularly in a landscape that has historically favored more centrist parties.\n\nIn Brussels, the Reformist Movement (MR) is showing promising results, with a polling percentage around **27.4%**, placing it ahead of the Socialist Party (PS) at **24.6%** <citation>https://brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1023133/bouchezs-liberals-surge-back-ahead-in-brussels-in-latest-polls</citation>.\n\n### Implications of the Polls\n\nThe results of these polls suggest a potential realignment of political power within Belgium. If VB and N-VA can maintain their momentum, they may significantly influence the formation of the federal government post-elections. The rise in support for populist and right-wing parties reflects broader trends seen across Europe, where similar parties are gaining traction.\n\nMoreover, with the upcoming elections being pivotal not only for the federal level but also for regional and European parliamentary seats, the implications of these polling results extend far beyond national boundaries. They may reshape coalition possibilities and governance in Belgium for years to come, especially amid the backdrop of pressing issues such as migration and economic recovery.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs Belgium heads towards the June 2024 federal elections, the landscape indicated by opinion polls suggests a competitive and potentially transformative electoral process. Key parties like VB and N-VA are positioned to play influential roles, and the dynamic nature of voter preferences will likely drive coalition negotiations in the aftermath of the election.

This election was characterized by notably low voter turnout, the lowest recorded since compulsory voting was established in 1893, reflecting a growing disconnect between the electorate and the political framework <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn the lead-up to the elections, a significant shift was observed towards the right in the political spectrum.

The elections are particularly noteworthy as they occur against a backdrop of shifting political dynamics in a country long characterized by a complex multi-party system and regional tensions between Flanders and Wallonia. \n\nPolling leading up to the elections indicates a notable shift to the right, with the populist radical right Vlaams Belang (VB) expected to secure a substantial share of the Flemish vote, potentially making it the largest party in the Chamber of Representatives. According to recent surveys, Vlaams Belang is poised to gain around 27% of the votes in Flanders, with the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) closely following. This shift reflects broader trends seen across Europe, where far-right parties have gained traction by focusing on issues such as migration and national identity <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>.\n\nThe elections will also see participation from a diverse pool of over 6,500 candidates, representing various political agendas across the spectrum <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/04/16/elections-24-6-550-candidates-standing-for-election-on-9-june/</citation>.

Comprising the Walloon region and certain Brussels municipalities, the French-speaking electoral college will elect representatives based on the preferences of its constituents.\n\nIn this election, there are a total of 8 seats allocated to the French-speaking constituency. The voting dynamics are notably influenced by the demographics of the region, where multiple French-speaking parties vie for influence. Key players include the Francophone Liberal Reformist Party (MR) and the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), which are expected to compete fiercely for voter support. Recent polling indicates that these parties are neck-and-neck, each capturing close to 22% of the electoral preferences, suggesting a highly competitive environment leading up to the election <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n\nBrussels, which has a significant French-speaking population, adds another layer to the electoral process, as voters from six municipalities can choose candidates from French-speaking lists. This unique characteristic of the electoral system allows for a nuanced representation of the French-speaking community and reflects Belgium's linguistic diversity <citation>https://elections.europa.eu/en/how-to-vote/be/</citation>.\n\nThe results of the election may lead to significant implications for coalition formations at the federal level. The previous coalition, comprising major French-speaking parties, is under scrutiny as both the political context and voter sentiments evolve. The potential return of a right-leaning coalition is also a factor to be considered <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nAs such, the French-speaking constituencies' outcomes are pivotal not only for local governance but also for the broader political direction of Belgium in the coming years.\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal elections approach, opinion polls are playing a crucial role in shaping the political landscape.

Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament. Another coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Elections 2024: Belgium's federal government crisis deepens as possible ...\\nURL: https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-belgiums-federal-government-crisis-deepens-as-possible-coalition-nears-collapse\\nCONTENT: After the 9 June elections, many Belgians kept their hopes up for a quick federal government formation. With the right-wing N-VA, led by De Wever, emerging as the winner in Flanders and the liberal MR dethroning the socialists in Wallonia, a coalition was, according to many observers, within reach.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Federal elections: Belgium shifts to the right, prime minister set to ...\\nURL: https://www.thebulletin.be/federal-elections-belgium-shifts-right-prime-minister-set-resign\\nCONTENT: Federal elections: Belgium shifts to the right, prime minister set to resign Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo announced his resignation on Sunday evening following his liberal party Open VLD‘s battering in Sunday’s national elections. Nationalist party N-VA now has the largest majority with 16.7% (a 0.7 percentage point rise), which means its leader Bart De Wever (pictured) is set to become Belgium’s next prime minister. Abstainers therefore represent virtually the second party in the country, not that far behind the N-VA and its 1.165 million voters. In the European Parliament elections, which also took place on Sunday, Flemish right-wing parties Vlaams Belang and N-VA each held on to their three seats in parliament.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: The 2024 Belgian federal elections: a race to the right\\nURL: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986\\nCONTENT: The Belgian federal elections held on 9 June 2024 marked a turning point in the country's political history.

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[7]:\\nTITLE: The 2024 Belgian federal elections: a race to the right\\nURL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391326019_The_2024_Belgian_federal_elections_a_race_to_the_right\\nCONTENT: Apr 2025): The 2024 Belgian federal elections: a race to the right, West Eur opean Politics, DOI:\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: 2024 Belgian federal election resignations\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: Belgium's PM De Croo resigns after election defeat - DW - 06/10/2024\\nURL: https://www.dw.com/en/belgian-pm-announces-resignation-after-difficult-evening/a-69318069\\nCONTENT: Belgium's PM De Croo resigns after election defeat 06/10/2024 Belgian PM Alexander De Croo announces resignation after his party's heavy defeat in federal and regional elections.

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders.

In Flanders, the centre-right N-VA, led by Antwerp mayor Bart De Wever, equally surprised pollsters by managing to remain the biggest Flemish party ahead of the right-wing populist Vlaams Belang, kept out of government with a cordon sanitaire imposed by all other political parties. In the new federal government program negotiated by Prime Minister De Wever, there is little emphasis on strengthening Flemish self-government, despite the N-VA’s nationalist roots, aiming for Belgium’s gradual dissolution. As a consequence, consolidating the fiscal situation of Belgium’s federal and regional policy levels most likely requires large-scale institutional reform.\\n--------------------------------------------------Query: 2024 elections Belgium incumbents stepping down\\nSearch Results:\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[1]:\\nTITLE: Looking ahead: The road to reinvention for Belgium's struggling ...\\nURL: https://www.belganewsagency.eu/looking-ahead-the-road-to-reinvention-for-belgiums-struggling-political-parties\\nCONTENT: Belgium’s 2024 elections exposed significant challenges for several political parties, from the Flemish liberals to the francophone socialists. To reconnect with its base and attract new supporters, the party will need to find a balance between traditional liberal principles and new solutions to issues like affordable housing, energy policy and social mobility. Critics, both within and outside the party, argue that Groen has become too much like traditional political organisations by focusing on power dynamics and internal disputes rather than bold, transformative solutions. To address these challenges, PS leader Paul Magnette has announced a “refoundation” of the party, a deep introspection aimed at rebuilding the party’s core identity and relevance in a political landscape that increasingly seems resistant to left-wing ideals of solidarity and collective responsibility.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[2]:\\nTITLE: Belgian government talks at a standstill after resignation of key ...\\nURL: https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/23/belgian-government-talks-at-a-standstill-after-resignation-of-key-negotiator\\nCONTENT: Euronews Tech Talks goes beyond discussions to explore the impact of new technologies on our lives.

De Croo handed over his resignation as prime minister to the country’s King Philippe, a procedural step after which the king meets with leaders of Belgium’s biggest parties: N-VA’s De Wever first, Vlaams Belang’s Tom Van Grieken second and MR’s Bouchez third.

Belgium has not voted for 4 years, the longest period without a ballot in peacetime since 1830, as Jean Faniel, Director General of the Centre de recherche et d'information socio-politiques (CRISP), has pointed out.\\nThe country has been governed since 30 September 2020 by the so-called Vivaldi coalition. Led by Alexander De Croo (Flemish Liberals and Democrats, Open VLD), it includes the Reform Movement (MR), the Flemish Christian Democrats (CD&V), the Socialist Party (PS), Vooruit (formerly the Flemish Socialist Party), Groen and Ecolo! This coalition of 7 parties is a first in the country. Its heterogeneity is significant, making agreements difficult.\\nAccording to an opinion poll carried out by the Kantar Institute for RTBF and the daily La Libre Belgique, the Vlaams Belang (VB) is expected to come out ahead in the general elections in Flanders with 26% of the vote, followed by the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) with 20.9% and the Workers’ Party (PTVB/PVDA) with 12.2%. The CD&V is expected to win 11.6%, Vooruit 11.5% and Open-VLD, the party of outgoing Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, 10.6%.\\nIn Wallonia, the Socialist Party (PS) is forecast to attract a quarter of the electorate and win 25.4% of the vote, ahead of the MR, with 20.8%. The Workers' Party is projected to take 3rd place with 16%. It is due to be followed by Les Engagés (formerly the Humanist Democratic Centre), with 13.9%, and Ecolo, with 12.7%.\\nFinally, in Brussels, the MR is in the lead with 22.9% of the vote. Ecolo is in 2nd place with 15.5%, ahead of the PS (14.2%) and the Workers' Party (14%).\\nOutgoing Prime Minister Alexander De Croo is one of the country's most popular figures in all three regions (Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels-Capital). However, his party is struggling to make any headway. The majority of voters in Flanders would like to see NVA leader Bart De Wever at Belgium’s helm, while Wallonia and Brussels prefer former Prime Minister (2019-2020) Sophie Wilmès (MR).\\nPre-election polls show a rise in radical forces, both left and right, in Belgium. This protest vote is characteristic of the low level of confidence that citizens have in their political representatives. According to Benjamin Biard, a political scientist at CRISP, voters for Vlaams Belang and the Workers' Party are those with the least confidence in democracy.\\nThe victory of parties on opposite sides of the political spectrum makes it difficult to form a federal government. The record is 541 days in 2010-2011. For Carl Devos, professor of political science at Ghent University, the next Belgian coalition government is bound to be formed by parties that are among the losers in the 9 June vote, given the large number of parties that were members of the outgoing government.\\nSocialist leader Paul Magnette could well see himself as the leader of a Vivaldi 2.0 coalition: \\\"Paul Magnette is a candidate, his political family will be the biggest on election night, and so will his party within that family. He has experience, he knows his groundwork, he knows Flanders well, he speaks Dutch and he enjoys international popularity and influence (...) But his very left-wing approach, to counter the Workers' Party, is not going down well in a Flanders that will vote right-wing\\\", said Carl Devos.\\nHow far will the Workers’ Party go?\\nThe match between the Socialist Party and the Workers' Party is central to the elections in Wallonia. The programme of the radical left party, whose spokesman is Raoul Hedebouw, focuses on tax justice (defending the taxation of wealth), the defence of purchasing power, the fight against \\\"political privileges\\\" and support for a socially just climate policy. It remains ambiguous about its support for NATO strategy and defends the idea that the West is responsible for the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.\\nAccording to opinion polls, the Workers' Party is attracting people who voted for both the Socialist Party and Ecolo in the previous general election on 26 May 2019.\\nThe Socialists criticise the radical activists for proposing the most generous social measures, as long as they refuse to rub shoulders with those in power. \\\"You have to vote for the parties that take their responsibilities\\\", Paul Magnette repeats. Raoul Hedebouw nevertheless maintained that his party's position of principle was not to remain in opposition, and that it was ready to participate in a government in which it could apply its programme for a break with the past, i.e. introducing a retirement age of 65, freeing up salaries, taxing large fortunes and putting an end to the policy of austerity.\\nWhen asked about the reasons behind the Workers' Party's breakthrough in the kingdom's French-speaking community since the previous general elections on 26 May 2019, Emilie van Haute, professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels, explains: \\\"The nature of the public debate is quite different: in Flanders, it is much more focused on migration issues, which is very favourable to Vlaams Belang, the party that has made these issues its main campaign theme. Conversely, on the French-speaking side, the public debate focuses on economic, social and environmental issues\\\". Unlike the situation in Flanders for the radical right, there is no cordon sanitaire to prevent the radical left from taking office in Wallonia.\\nThe MR, led by Georges-Louis Bouchez, who has been in every government since 1999, is the only right-wing force in Wallonia. Former Prime Minister (2019-2020) Sophie Wilmès is leading the fight against the radical left. \\\"We have to be much less indulgent about the programme offered by the Workers' Party. It's a programme of rejection, finger-pointing and total irresponsibility. Their magic recipes don't work anywhere. These are recipes for impoverishment\\\", she declared.\\nThe party has recently become more right-wing, particularly in socio-cultural matters. This direction is criticised by some members.\\nEcolo is losing ground in opinion polls because of speeches questioning its programme for defending an overly punitive ecology.\\nThe CD&V advocates a model with four entities (Flanders, Wallonia, Brussels and the eastern cantons, which include the German-speaking community), which would be a sort of mini-entity due to its small size and population. The French community would disappear in favour of Wallonia and Brussels. The party wants to give the federated entities greater fiscal autonomy, and to transfer to them competences that are the responsibility of the federal level, such as health and labour market policy.\\nVlaams Belang expected to come first in Flanders\\nIn Flanders, the match is between the NVA and Vlaams Belang. The latter is leading in opinion polls, a first in Belgian history. Tom Van Grieken's party, whose slogan is \\\"Eigen volk eerst\\\" (Our people first), is riding high on an election campaign focused on immigration issues, a subject on which it is seen by Flemish voters as the party offering the best solutions. The main issue put forward by NVA voters is separatism and the introduction of confederalism. \\\"Vlaams Belang is an anti-system party, and a vote for it is a way of kicking politics and centrist parties in the butt. It is a Flemish nationalist party for an independent Flanders. It has also adopted socio-economic positions that make it look like a left-wing party in this area, but the factor in Vlaams Belang's success is clearly its programme on immigration,\\\" said Vincent de Coorebyter, President of the Centre for Sociopolitical Research and Information (CRISP) and holder of the Chair of Contemporary Social and Political Philosophy at the Free University of Belgium (ULB).\\n\\\"Vlaams Belang is the only party that has no part in the present government: we are seeing a rise in discontent among voters, a lot of negative emotion, and the party is managing to channel this anger and embody a solution to the mistrust of the political class in Flanders. Polls show that fe[TOO LONG, END]\\n\\n---\\nURL: https://misplaced.pages.dev/2024_Belgian_federal_election\\nTitle: Untitled\\nContent:\\nNo content available\\n\\n---\\nError for URL https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986: HTTP 403: Forbidden\\n\"</result></tool_use_result>"

In the run-up to the elections, the radical-right VB dominated the news because it was heading the polls and seemed to dethrone the N-VA as largest party in Flanders. Though N-VA was part of several coalitions since its inception and never governed with VB, during the campaign the party was often asked to provide clarity on its stance toward the cordon – not least because both parties have ideological overlap, for example toward an autonomous Flanders and migration.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections guide: What Belgium's parties stand for\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/1010080/belgian-elections-guide-2024\\nCONTENT: Sister party in French-speaking Belgium: MR Sister party in French-speaking Belgium: Les Engagés European Parliament group: European People’s Party (EPP) History: Founded in 1968 as the Christian People's Party (Christelijke Volkspartij, CVP), the party changed its name to Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V) in 2001.

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件，要求简单清晰即可\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal election will see the French-speaking constituency play a critical role in the political landscape of Belgium. Comprising the Walloon region and certain Brussels municipalities, the French-speaking electoral college will elect representatives based on the preferences of its constituents.\n\nIn this election, there are a total of 8 seats allocated to the French-speaking constituency. The voting dynamics are notably influenced by the demographics of the region, where multiple French-speaking parties vie for influence. Key players include the Francophone Liberal Reformist Party (MR) and the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), which are expected to compete fiercely for voter support. Recent polling indicates that these parties are neck-and-neck, each capturing close to 22% of the electoral preferences, suggesting a highly competitive environment leading up to the election <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n\nBrussels, which has a significant French-speaking population, adds another layer to the electoral process, as voters from six municipalities can choose candidates from French-speaking lists. This unique characteristic of the electoral system allows for a nuanced representation of the French-speaking community and reflects Belgium's linguistic diversity <citation>https://elections.europa.eu/en/how-to-vote/be/</citation>.\n\nThe results of the election may lead to significant implications for coalition formations at the federal level. The previous coalition, comprising major French-speaking parties, is under scrutiny as both the political context and voter sentiments evolve. The potential return of a right-leaning coalition is also a factor to be considered <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nAs such, the French-speaking constituencies' outcomes are pivotal not only for local governance but also for the broader political direction of Belgium in the coming years.\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal elections approach, opinion polls are playing a crucial role in shaping the political landscape. Various organizations conduct surveys to gauge voter intentions, offering a snapshot of the political sentiments prevalent in different regions of Belgium.\n\n### Current Polling Data\n\nRecent polling data indicate a strong showing for the far-right party, Vlaams Belang (VB), which has emerged as a significant force in the Flemish region. As of the latest surveys, VB is projected to capture approximately **26%** of the Flemish vote, closely followed by the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) with **20.9%** and the Workers' Party (PTB/PVDA) at **12.2%** <citation>https://robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>. This marks a notable shift in voter sentiment, particularly in a landscape that has historically favored more centrist parties.\n\nIn Brussels, the Reformist Movement (MR) is showing promising results, with a polling percentage around **27.4%**, placing it ahead of the Socialist Party (PS) at **24.6%** <citation>https://brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1023133/bouchezs-liberals-surge-back-ahead-in-brussels-in-latest-polls</citation>.\n\n### Implications of the Polls\n\nThe results of these polls suggest a potential realignment of political power within Belgium. If VB and N-VA can maintain their momentum, they may significantly influence the formation of the federal government post-elections. The rise in support for populist and right-wing parties reflects broader trends seen across Europe, where similar parties are gaining traction.\n\nMoreover, with the upcoming elections being pivotal not only for the federal level but also for regional and European parliamentary seats, the implications of these polling results extend far beyond national boundaries. They may reshape coalition possibilities and governance in Belgium for years to come, especially amid the backdrop of pressing issues such as migration and economic recovery.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs Belgium heads towards the June 2024 federal elections, the landscape indicated by opinion polls suggests a competitive and potentially transformative electoral process. Key parties like VB and N-VA are positioned to play influential roles, and the dynamic nature of voter preferences will likely drive coalition negotiations in the aftermath of the election. Continuous monitoring of polling data will be essential in understanding the evolving political scene in Belgium <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls</citation>.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections took place on June 9, 2024, marking a significant moment in the nation’s political landscape, particularly as it was the first federal vote following the COVID-19 pandemic. This election was characterized by notably low voter turnout, the lowest recorded since compulsory voting was established in 1893, reflecting a growing disconnect between the electorate and the political framework <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn the lead-up to the elections, a significant shift was observed towards the right in the political spectrum. The far-right party, Vlaams Belang (VB), was anticipated to perform strongly, with projections suggesting they could secure around 27% of the votes in Flanders. This was indicative of a broader trend across Europe where populist and nationalist sentiments have surged <citation>https://apnews.com/article/eu-belgium-elections-far-right-left-151765c619da911898b058e83f2f8ea4</citation>.\n\nThe primary issues that dominated the campaign included migration, socio-economic reforms, and public financial management. The nature of public discourse, especially in Flanders, was heavily focused on migration, which benefitted the Vlaams Belang as it has positioned itself as a staunch opponent of immigration <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>. Concurrently, the Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) gained traction among the French-speaking population, reflecting a divergence in priorities between the two linguistic regions <citation>https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/16/in-belgium-stupefaction-after-federal-parliamentary-elections_6674912_4.html</citation>.\n\nThe aftermath of the elections saw complex coalition negotiations unfold, typical in Belgian politics, due to the fragmented parliamentary landscape. Various coalitions were suggested, including a revival of the centre-right \"Swedish\" coalition and the potential for more unorthodox alliances given the shift in party strengths <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the 2024 elections showcased a pivotal and contentious period in Belgian politics, with rising right-wing sentiments and significant challenges in coalition building, setting the stage for how the government will address pressing national issues moving forward.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, scheduled for June 9, 2024, promise to be a significant event in the political landscape of Belgium. This election marks the first major federal vote post-pandemic, and it comes amid unprecedented social and economic changes. The elections are particularly noteworthy as they occur against a backdrop of shifting political dynamics in a country long characterized by a complex multi-party system and regional tensions between Flanders and Wallonia. \n\nPolling leading up to the elections indicates a notable shift to the right, with the populist radical right Vlaams Belang (VB) expected to secure a substantial share of the Flemish vote, potentially making it the largest party in the Chamber of Representatives. According to recent surveys, Vlaams Belang is poised to gain around 27% of the votes in Flanders, with the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) closely following. This shift reflects broader trends seen across Europe, where far-right parties have gained traction by focusing on issues such as migration and national identity <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>.\n\nThe elections will also see participation from a diverse pool of over 6,500 candidates, representing various political agendas across the spectrum <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/04/16/elections-24-6-550-candidates-standing-for-election-on-9-june/</citation>. This level of candidacy indicates a robust democratic engagement, despite expectations of one of the lowest voter turnouts since mandatory voting was established in 1893 <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nAs Belgium navigates its complex governance structure, the results of this election could have significant implications, potentially reshaping coalition dynamics and future governance strategies. The outcomes may also influence Belgium's role within the European Union, as it balances national interests with broader continental policies <citation>https://www.brussels.be/european-federal-and-regional-elections</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to be a pivotal moment in the nation's political history, with potential for substantial change in both domestic and European contexts. As voters prepare for the polls, the implications of their choices will resonate well beyond the immediate electoral outcomes.\n无法生成章节内容\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Senate\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

        "value": "<answer>\n### Senate\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, which took place on June 9, 2024, led to significant developments in the Belgian Senate. Key outcomes of these elections revealed a marked shift in the political landscape, driven by rising voter support for nationalist and right-leaning parties.\n\nThe Belgian Senate is composed of 60 members: 50 senators are appointed by regional parliaments, while the remaining 10 are co-opted based on party representation outcomes in the federal elections. In the latest election results, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), a Flemish nationalist party, emerged as the largest party in the Senate, securing 10 seats. This shift emphasizes the growth of nationalist sentiment in the northern region of Flanders, evident from the N-VA's strong electoral performance where it garnered about 23.9% of the votes in Flanders, narrowly edging out the populist Vlaams Belang, which captured approximately 22.7% <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>.\n\nPost-election, the coalition dynamics face challenges, particularly with the government’s agenda to abolish the Senate altogether. Such a change is complicated, requiring a supermajority constitutional amendment supported by two-thirds of both chambers of parliament. Given the current political context, with opposition parties likely to resist this move, the future of the Senate remains uncertain <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2025/05/15/abolition-senate-de-wever-talks/</citation>.\n\nThe 2024 elections recorded one of the lowest voter turnouts in history, attributed partly to pandemic fatigue and political polarization affecting public engagement <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The Senate's role in shaping Belgian governance is pivotal as it reflects the diverse political views of the country, highlighting ongoing tensions and potential reforms in the coming years.\n\nOverall, the elections not only solidified the N-VA’s position in the Senate but also set the stage for significant political reforms, including the contentious proposal to abolish the Senate, which could reshape the future governance of Belgium <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n</answer>"

Comprising the Walloon region and certain Brussels municipalities, the French-speaking electoral college will elect representatives based on the preferences of its constituents.\n\nIn this election, there are a total of 8 seats allocated to the French-speaking constituency. The voting dynamics are notably influenced by the demographics of the region, where multiple French-speaking parties vie for influence. Key players include the Francophone Liberal Reformist Party (MR) and the Francophone Socialist Party (PS), which are expected to compete fiercely for voter support. Recent polling indicates that these parties are neck-and-neck, each capturing close to 22% of the electoral preferences, suggesting a highly competitive environment leading up to the election <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n\nBrussels, which has a significant French-speaking population, adds another layer to the electoral process, as voters from six municipalities can choose candidates from French-speaking lists. This unique characteristic of the electoral system allows for a nuanced representation of the French-speaking community and reflects Belgium's linguistic diversity <citation>https://elections.europa.eu/en/how-to-vote/be/</citation>.\n\nThe results of the election may lead to significant implications for coalition formations at the federal level. The previous coalition, comprising major French-speaking parties, is under scrutiny as both the political context and voter sentiments evolve. The potential return of a right-leaning coalition is also a factor to be considered <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nAs such, the French-speaking constituencies' outcomes are pivotal not only for local governance but also for the broader political direction of Belgium in the coming years.\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal elections approach, opinion polls are playing a crucial role in shaping the political landscape. Various organizations conduct surveys to gauge voter intentions, offering a snapshot of the political sentiments prevalent in different regions of Belgium.\n\n### Current Polling Data\n\nRecent polling data indicate a strong showing for the far-right party, Vlaams Belang (VB), which has emerged as a significant force in the Flemish region. As of the latest surveys, VB is projected to capture approximately **26%** of the Flemish vote, closely followed by the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) with **20.9%** and the Workers' Party (PTB/PVDA) at **12.2%** <citation>https://robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>. This marks a notable shift in voter sentiment, particularly in a landscape that has historically favored more centrist parties.\n\nIn Brussels, the Reformist Movement (MR) is showing promising results, with a polling percentage around **27.4%**, placing it ahead of the Socialist Party (PS) at **24.6%** <citation>https://brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1023133/bouchezs-liberals-surge-back-ahead-in-brussels-in-latest-polls</citation>.\n\n### Implications of the Polls\n\nThe results of these polls suggest a potential realignment of political power within Belgium. If VB and N-VA can maintain their momentum, they may significantly influence the formation of the federal government post-elections. The rise in support for populist and right-wing parties reflects broader trends seen across Europe, where similar parties are gaining traction.\n\nMoreover, with the upcoming elections being pivotal not only for the federal level but also for regional and European parliamentary seats, the implications of these polling results extend far beyond national boundaries. They may reshape coalition possibilities and governance in Belgium for years to come, especially amid the backdrop of pressing issues such as migration and economic recovery.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs Belgium heads towards the June 2024 federal elections, the landscape indicated by opinion polls suggests a competitive and potentially transformative electoral process. Key parties like VB and N-VA are positioned to play influential roles, and the dynamic nature of voter preferences will likely drive coalition negotiations in the aftermath of the election. Continuous monitoring of polling data will be essential in understanding the evolving political scene in Belgium <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls</citation>.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections took place on June 9, 2024, marking a significant moment in the nation’s political landscape, particularly as it was the first federal vote following the COVID-19 pandemic. This election was characterized by notably low voter turnout, the lowest recorded since compulsory voting was established in 1893, reflecting a growing disconnect between the electorate and the political framework <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn the lead-up to the elections, a significant shift was observed towards the right in the political spectrum. The far-right party, Vlaams Belang (VB), was anticipated to perform strongly, with projections suggesting they could secure around 27% of the votes in Flanders. This was indicative of a broader trend across Europe where populist and nationalist sentiments have surged <citation>https://apnews.com/article/eu-belgium-elections-far-right-left-151765c619da911898b058e83f2f8ea4</citation>.\n\nThe primary issues that dominated the campaign included migration, socio-economic reforms, and public financial management. The nature of public discourse, especially in Flanders, was heavily focused on migration, which benefitted the Vlaams Belang as it has positioned itself as a staunch opponent of immigration <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>. Concurrently, the Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) gained traction among the French-speaking population, reflecting a divergence in priorities between the two linguistic regions <citation>https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/16/in-belgium-stupefaction-after-federal-parliamentary-elections_6674912_4.html</citation>.\n\nThe aftermath of the elections saw complex coalition negotiations unfold, typical in Belgian politics, due to the fragmented parliamentary landscape. Various coalitions were suggested, including a revival of the centre-right \"Swedish\" coalition and the potential for more unorthodox alliances given the shift in party strengths <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the 2024 elections showcased a pivotal and contentious period in Belgian politics, with rising right-wing sentiments and significant challenges in coalition building, setting the stage for how the government will address pressing national issues moving forward.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, scheduled for June 9, 2024, promise to be a significant event in the political landscape of Belgium. This election marks the first major federal vote post-pandemic, and it comes amid unprecedented social and economic changes. The elections are particularly noteworthy as they occur against a backdrop of shifting political dynamics in a country long characterized by a complex multi-party system and regional tensions between Flanders and Wallonia. \n\nPolling leading up to the elections indicates a notable shift to the right, with the populist radical right Vlaams Belang (VB) expected to secure a substantial share of the Flemish vote, potentially making it the largest party in the Chamber of Representatives. According to recent surveys, Vlaams Belang is poised to gain around 27% of the votes in Flanders, with the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) closely following. This shift reflects broader trends seen across Europe, where far-right parties have gained traction by focusing on issues such as migration and national identity <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>.\n\nThe elections will also see participation from a diverse pool of over 6,500 candidates, representing various political agendas across the spectrum <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/04/16/elections-24-6-550-candidates-standing-for-election-on-9-june/</citation>. This level of candidacy indicates a robust democratic engagement, despite expectations of one of the lowest voter turnouts since mandatory voting was established in 1893 <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nAs Belgium navigates its complex governance structure, the results of this election could have significant implications, potentially reshaping coalition dynamics and future governance strategies. The outcomes may also influence Belgium's role within the European Union, as it balances national interests with broader continental policies <citation>https://www.brussels.be/european-federal-and-regional-elections</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to be a pivotal moment in the nation's political history, with potential for substantial change in both domestic and European contexts. As voters prepare for the polls, the implications of their choices will resonate well beyond the immediate electoral outcomes.\n无法生成章节内容\n### Senate\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, which took place on June 9, 2024, led to significant developments in the Belgian Senate. Key outcomes of these elections revealed a marked shift in the political landscape, driven by rising voter support for nationalist and right-leaning parties.\n\nThe Belgian Senate is composed of 60 members: 50 senators are appointed by regional parliaments, while the remaining 10 are co-opted based on party representation outcomes in the federal elections. In the latest election results, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), a Flemish nationalist party, emerged as the largest party in the Senate, securing 10 seats. This shift emphasizes the growth of nationalist sentiment in the northern region of Flanders, evident from the N-VA's strong electoral performance where it garnered about 23.9% of the votes in Flanders, narrowly edging out the populist Vlaams Belang, which captured approximately 22.7% <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>.\n\nPost-election, the coalition dynamics face challenges, particularly with the government’s agenda to abolish the Senate altogether. Such a change is complicated, requiring a supermajority constitutional amendment supported by two-thirds of both chambers of parliament. Given the current political context, with opposition parties likely to resist this move, the future of the Senate remains uncertain <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2025/05/15/abolition-senate-de-wever-talks/</citation>.\n\nThe 2024 elections recorded one of the lowest voter turnouts in history, attributed partly to pandemic fatigue and political polarization affecting public engagement <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The Senate's role in shaping Belgian governance is pivotal as it reflects the diverse political views of the country, highlighting ongoing tensions and potential reforms in the coming years.\n\nOverall, the elections not only solidified the N-VA’s position in the Senate but also set the stage for significant political reforms, including the contentious proposal to abolish the Senate, which could reshape the future governance of Belgium <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Electoral system\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

        "value": "<answer>\n## Electoral System\n\nThe electoral system employed in Belgium for federal elections is a complex proportional representation system, primarily characterized by an open-list format. This means that voters can select candidates from party lists rather than voting for party lists alone. Each party presents a list of candidates, and voters have the option to either vote for individual candidates or simply for the party.\n\n### Key Features of the Electoral System\n\n1. **Proportional Representation**: Belgium uses a flexible-list proportional representation system for federal elections. This ensures that the number of seats each party gains in the Chamber of Representatives corresponds closely to the percentage of votes they receive.\n\n2. **Voting Process**: During elections, voters receive an electoral envelope containing a ballot paper, which lists the political parties along with their candidates. Voters can mark their preferred candidates or vote for an entire party, ensuring that party votes are firstly allocated to the top candidates until they secure enough votes to be elected.\n\n3. **Multi-Level Elections**: The federal elections, which occur every five years, are typically held simultaneously with regional elections and elections for the European Parliament. This multi-layered voting structure requires voters to participate in several elections on the same day, which was notably scheduled for June 9, 2024.\n\n4. **Electoral Quotas and Districts**: Seats in the Chamber of Representatives are allocated based on electoral districts using the D'Hondt divisional method. This involves calculating electoral quotas to ensure representation is proportionate to the votes obtained by each party in various districts. Parties must secure a minimum threshold of votes within a district to gain representation.\n\n5. **Compulsory Voting**: Voting in Belgium is compulsory for all citizens aged 18 and over. This legal requirement is intended to enhance civic participation and ensure higher voter turnout, although turnouts can vary significantly from one election to another.\n\n### Recent Developments\n\nThe 2024 elections are particularly significant as they mark the first federal election post-pandemic. Recent changes to voting laws also allow 16- and 17-year-olds to participate in European elections, reflecting a progressive shift in the electorate demographics that may influence the political landscape. Nonetheless, Belgium remains a multi-lingual nation with a complex federal structure, which is reflected in its unique electoral dynamics and party representation strategies<citation>https://electiopedia.com/elections-in-belgium/</citation><citation>https://www.reuters.com/article/world/factbox-key-facts-about-belgiums-electoral-system-idUSL10246183/</citation><citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/991247/proportional-representation-in-belgium-how-does-it-work/</citation>.\n</answer>"

Recent polling indicates that these parties are neck-and-neck, each capturing close to 22% of the electoral preferences, suggesting a highly competitive environment leading up to the election <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n\nBrussels, which has a significant French-speaking population, adds another layer to the electoral process, as voters from six municipalities can choose candidates from French-speaking lists. This unique characteristic of the electoral system allows for a nuanced representation of the French-speaking community and reflects Belgium's linguistic diversity <citation>https://elections.europa.eu/en/how-to-vote/be/</citation>.\n\nThe results of the election may lead to significant implications for coalition formations at the federal level. The previous coalition, comprising major French-speaking parties, is under scrutiny as both the political context and voter sentiments evolve. The potential return of a right-leaning coalition is also a factor to be considered <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nAs such, the French-speaking constituencies' outcomes are pivotal not only for local governance but also for the broader political direction of Belgium in the coming years.\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal elections approach, opinion polls are playing a crucial role in shaping the political landscape. Various organizations conduct surveys to gauge voter intentions, offering a snapshot of the political sentiments prevalent in different regions of Belgium.\n\n### Current Polling Data\n\nRecent polling data indicate a strong showing for the far-right party, Vlaams Belang (VB), which has emerged as a significant force in the Flemish region. As of the latest surveys, VB is projected to capture approximately **26%** of the Flemish vote, closely followed by the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) with **20.9%** and the Workers' Party (PTB/PVDA) at **12.2%** <citation>https://robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>. This marks a notable shift in voter sentiment, particularly in a landscape that has historically favored more centrist parties.\n\nIn Brussels, the Reformist Movement (MR) is showing promising results, with a polling percentage around **27.4%**, placing it ahead of the Socialist Party (PS) at **24.6%** <citation>https://brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1023133/bouchezs-liberals-surge-back-ahead-in-brussels-in-latest-polls</citation>.\n\n### Implications of the Polls\n\nThe results of these polls suggest a potential realignment of political power within Belgium. If VB and N-VA can maintain their momentum, they may significantly influence the formation of the federal government post-elections. The rise in support for populist and right-wing parties reflects broader trends seen across Europe, where similar parties are gaining traction.\n\nMoreover, with the upcoming elections being pivotal not only for the federal level but also for regional and European parliamentary seats, the implications of these polling results extend far beyond national boundaries. They may reshape coalition possibilities and governance in Belgium for years to come, especially amid the backdrop of pressing issues such as migration and economic recovery.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs Belgium heads towards the June 2024 federal elections, the landscape indicated by opinion polls suggests a competitive and potentially transformative electoral process. Key parties like VB and N-VA are positioned to play influential roles, and the dynamic nature of voter preferences will likely drive coalition negotiations in the aftermath of the election. Continuous monitoring of polling data will be essential in understanding the evolving political scene in Belgium <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls</citation>.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections took place on June 9, 2024, marking a significant moment in the nation’s political landscape, particularly as it was the first federal vote following the COVID-19 pandemic. This election was characterized by notably low voter turnout, the lowest recorded since compulsory voting was established in 1893, reflecting a growing disconnect between the electorate and the political framework <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nIn the lead-up to the elections, a significant shift was observed towards the right in the political spectrum. The far-right party, Vlaams Belang (VB), was anticipated to perform strongly, with projections suggesting they could secure around 27% of the votes in Flanders. This was indicative of a broader trend across Europe where populist and nationalist sentiments have surged <citation>https://apnews.com/article/eu-belgium-elections-far-right-left-151765c619da911898b058e83f2f8ea4</citation>.\n\nThe primary issues that dominated the campaign included migration, socio-economic reforms, and public financial management. The nature of public discourse, especially in Flanders, was heavily focused on migration, which benefitted the Vlaams Belang as it has positioned itself as a staunch opponent of immigration <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>. Concurrently, the Workers' Party (PTB-PVDA) gained traction among the French-speaking population, reflecting a divergence in priorities between the two linguistic regions <citation>https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/16/in-belgium-stupefaction-after-federal-parliamentary-elections_6674912_4.html</citation>.\n\nThe aftermath of the elections saw complex coalition negotiations unfold, typical in Belgian politics, due to the fragmented parliamentary landscape. Various coalitions were suggested, including a revival of the centre-right \"Swedish\" coalition and the potential for more unorthodox alliances given the shift in party strengths <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the 2024 elections showcased a pivotal and contentious period in Belgian politics, with rising right-wing sentiments and significant challenges in coalition building, setting the stage for how the government will address pressing national issues moving forward.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, scheduled for June 9, 2024, promise to be a significant event in the political landscape of Belgium. This election marks the first major federal vote post-pandemic, and it comes amid unprecedented social and economic changes. The elections are particularly noteworthy as they occur against a backdrop of shifting political dynamics in a country long characterized by a complex multi-party system and regional tensions between Flanders and Wallonia. \n\nPolling leading up to the elections indicates a notable shift to the right, with the populist radical right Vlaams Belang (VB) expected to secure a substantial share of the Flemish vote, potentially making it the largest party in the Chamber of Representatives. According to recent surveys, Vlaams Belang is poised to gain around 27% of the votes in Flanders, with the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) closely following. This shift reflects broader trends seen across Europe, where far-right parties have gained traction by focusing on issues such as migration and national identity <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>.\n\nThe elections will also see participation from a diverse pool of over 6,500 candidates, representing various political agendas across the spectrum <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/04/16/elections-24-6-550-candidates-standing-for-election-on-9-june/</citation>. This level of candidacy indicates a robust democratic engagement, despite expectations of one of the lowest voter turnouts since mandatory voting was established in 1893 <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nAs Belgium navigates its complex governance structure, the results of this election could have significant implications, potentially reshaping coalition dynamics and future governance strategies. The outcomes may also influence Belgium's role within the European Union, as it balances national interests with broader continental policies <citation>https://www.brussels.be/european-federal-and-regional-elections</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to be a pivotal moment in the nation's political history, with potential for substantial change in both domestic and European contexts. As voters prepare for the polls, the implications of their choices will resonate well beyond the immediate electoral outcomes.\n无法生成章节内容\n### Senate\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, which took place on June 9, 2024, led to significant developments in the Belgian Senate. Key outcomes of these elections revealed a marked shift in the political landscape, driven by rising voter support for nationalist and right-leaning parties.\n\nThe Belgian Senate is composed of 60 members: 50 senators are appointed by regional parliaments, while the remaining 10 are co-opted based on party representation outcomes in the federal elections. In the latest election results, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), a Flemish nationalist party, emerged as the largest party in the Senate, securing 10 seats. This shift emphasizes the growth of nationalist sentiment in the northern region of Flanders, evident from the N-VA's strong electoral performance where it garnered about 23.9% of the votes in Flanders, narrowly edging out the populist Vlaams Belang, which captured approximately 22.7% <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>.\n\nPost-election, the coalition dynamics face challenges, particularly with the government’s agenda to abolish the Senate altogether. Such a change is complicated, requiring a supermajority constitutional amendment supported by two-thirds of both chambers of parliament. Given the current political context, with opposition parties likely to resist this move, the future of the Senate remains uncertain <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2025/05/15/abolition-senate-de-wever-talks/</citation>.\n\nThe 2024 elections recorded one of the lowest voter turnouts in history, attributed partly to pandemic fatigue and political polarization affecting public engagement <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The Senate's role in shaping Belgian governance is pivotal as it reflects the diverse political views of the country, highlighting ongoing tensions and potential reforms in the coming years.\n\nOverall, the elections not only solidified the N-VA’s position in the Senate but also set the stage for significant political reforms, including the contentious proposal to abolish the Senate, which could reshape the future governance of Belgium <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n## Electoral System\n\nThe electoral system employed in Belgium for federal elections is a complex proportional representation system, primarily characterized by an open-list format. This means that voters can select candidates from party lists rather than voting for party lists alone. Each party presents a list of candidates, and voters have the option to either vote for individual candidates or simply for the party.\n\n### Key Features of the Electoral System\n\n1. **Proportional Representation**: Belgium uses a flexible-list proportional representation system for federal elections. This ensures that the number of seats each party gains in the Chamber of Representatives corresponds closely to the percentage of votes they receive.\n\n2. **Voting Process**: During elections, voters receive an electoral envelope containing a ballot paper, which lists the political parties along with their candidates. Voters can mark their preferred candidates or vote for an entire party, ensuring that party votes are firstly allocated to the top candidates until they secure enough votes to be elected.\n\n3. **Multi-Level Elections**: The federal elections, which occur every five years, are typically held simultaneously with regional elections and elections for the European Parliament. This multi-layered voting structure requires voters to participate in several elections on the same day, which was notably scheduled for June 9, 2024.\n\n4. **Electoral Quotas and Districts**: Seats in the Chamber of Representatives are allocated based on electoral districts using the D'Hondt divisional method. This involves calculating electoral quotas to ensure representation is proportionate to the votes obtained by each party in various districts. Parties must secure a minimum threshold of votes within a district to gain representation.\n\n5. **Compulsory Voting**: Voting in Belgium is compulsory for all citizens aged 18 and over. This legal requirement is intended to enhance civic participation and ensure higher voter turnout, although turnouts can vary significantly from one election to another.\n\n### Recent Developments\n\nThe 2024 elections are particularly significant as they mark the first federal election post-pandemic. Recent changes to voting laws also allow 16- and 17-year-olds to participate in European elections, reflecting a progressive shift in the electorate demographics that may influence the political landscape. Nonetheless, Belgium remains a multi-lingual nation with a complex federal structure, which is reflected in its unique electoral dynamics and party representation strategies<citation>https://electiopedia.com/elections-in-belgium/</citation><citation>https://www.reuters.com/article/world/factbox-key-facts-about-belgiums-electoral-system-idUSL10246183/</citation><citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/991247/proportional-representation-in-belgium-how-does-it-work/</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Aftermath\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The election results revealed an increased support for right-leaning parties, with the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the Reformist Movement (MR) emerging as the notable victors in Flanders and Wallonia, respectively. The elections resulted in a fragmented parliament, complicating the coalition-building process necessary for forming a government <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1087277/election-aftermath-kingmakers-deal-breakers-and-will-flanders-break-with-belgium</citation>.\n\nImmediately following the elections, significant shifts were noted among the political parties. The outgoing prime minister, Alexander De Croo, resigned in accordance with royal protocol, leading to discussions with the leaders of the major parties to explore the formation of a new government <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>. The predominance of right-wing parties created the potential for a so-called \"Swedish coalition\" that may exclude left-wing parties, particularly if the N-VA engages with others like the MR to secure a majority <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nVoter turnout was reported at 87.4%, one of the highest in recent elections, but the results indicated a concerning trend towards radicalization and increased polarisation within the electorate, with a significant portion backing populist and far-right parties like Vlaams Belang, which capitalized on dissatisfaction with mainstream politics <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The political mix presents a challenge: how to govern effectively in a landscape where traditional coalitions may no longer hold a majority. The implications of this election are likely to reverberate across Belgium's political institutions, prompting discussions on governance, reform, and potential institutional adjustments <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n\nOverall, the aftermath of the 2024 Belgian federal elections suggests a period of transformation and potential volatility in Belgian politics as parties negotiate the future direction of governance and public policy amidst shifting voter sentiments.\n</answer>"
