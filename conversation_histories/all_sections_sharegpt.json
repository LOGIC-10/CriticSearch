Left: A rebel fighter gestures while standing on a military aircraft that belonged to forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, inside Hama's military airport, after Syrian rebels battled government forces for control of the key city of Homs on Saturday and advanced towards the capital Damascus as front lines collapsed across the country, in Hama, Syria, Dec. 7, 2024.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Syria: Which countries have been involved in the war and why?\\nURL: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd75e8gdy9jo\\nCONTENT: Those with a vested interest in the conflict and the future of the country include, on one side, Russia and Iran - which backed Assad - and on the other, the US and Turkey, which supported different rebel groups and militias. During Syria's civil war, Turkey has supported rebel factions - most of which now fight under the banner of the Syrian National Army (SNA) - by providing arms, military and political support. Russian President Vladimir Putin used his country's presence in Syria, and support of Assad, to challenge the power and dominance of the West in the region. Since rebels overthrew Assad, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes across Syria.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Rebel Gains in Syria Put Russia on the Back Foot\\nURL: https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/12/russia-syria-uprising-problems?lang=en\\nCONTENT: The loss of Aleppo is a major reversal for Damascus and its allies and will return the issue of Syria to the top of the agenda in Russia-Türkiye relations. The offensive by Islamic militants and allied pro-Turkish groups in Syria’s Idlib and Aleppo provinces is the biggest military escalation in Syria since Russia and Türkiye brokered a ceasefire in 2020. In recent years, Russia has sought instead to focus on political issues in Syria, pushing for a normalization of ties between Ankara and Damascus. While direct negotiations between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Assad have been impossible to arrange because of Assad’s intransigence (he has insisted on the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Syria as a precondition for normalizing relations), the recent events in Aleppo might change the balance of power, forcing Damascus to soften its demands.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Syria: What is the situation five months after Assad's fall?\\nURL: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/syria-what-is-the-situation-five-months-after-assads-fall/\\nCONTENT: In December 2024, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a UN-designated terrorist group that previously governed Idlib in northwest Syria, captured the Syrian capital, Damascus, and declared a transitional government. This Insight looks at the current state of Syria and international reaction to the newly declared government. In April 2025, the leader of HTS and declared interim President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, announced a new government and constitutional declaration. Israel has occupied parts of southern Syria around the Golan Heights for an “unlimited amount of time” and says no forces of the declared Syrian Government should enter the region. The UK Government and the European Union have both welcomed the declaration of a new Syrian Government and its commitment to elections and the rights of minorities.

If Russia succeeds in doing so, it could regain influence in other regions, including Syria and the Middle East. Russian sway in Syria allowed Moscow to block potential natural gas pipeline projects from the Persian Gulf to Europe, which could circumvent Russia. Additionally, from Moscow’s perspective, what happened in Syria was primarily a defeat for its Syrian allies, rather than for Russia. From its perspective, a victory over the Western countries in Ukraine would provide momentum for a shift toward a polycentric world order and imply that Russia’s revitalization in the Middle East remains possible in the long term.

Despite the loss of Aleppo to rebel forces, Russia, alongside Syria, conducted airstrikes against Islamist-led rebels who had seized control of significant areas. The resurgence of conflict marked the largest military escalation since the ceasefire brokered by Russia and Türkiye in 2020 [source](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/12/02/syria-russia-conduct-deadly-strikes-to-push-back-islamist-advance-a87187).\n\n#### Political and Strategic Interests\nThroughout the conflict, Russia aimed to maintain its military presence and geopolitical influence by securing its bases, which remain strategically important for its operations in the Mediterranean and broader Middle East. Despite the shifting alliances and changes in Syrian governance, Russia has sought to bolster its regional influence while engaging in negotiations with other key players, including Iran and Türkiye [source](https://theworld.org/stories/2024/12/09/russias-military-role-in-syria).\n\n#### Challenges and Diplomacy\nThe fall of Assad and the rise of opposition groups presented new challenges for Russia.

Fighters from various rebel factions, including a group linked to Al Qaeda called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, had advanced by Wednesday to within about six miles of Aleppo and taken over weapons and vehicles previously held by forces loyal to the government of President Bashar al-Assad, according to the monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. “Pro-regime militias have been upping their attacks in the area, trying to deter the rebels because Israel has been weakening the Syrian regime’s allies like Hezbollah and Iran,” said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an ...\\nURL: https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and\\nCONTENT: The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an opportunity for Turkey and a challenge for Russia | OSW Centre for Eastern Studies The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an opportunity for Turkey and a challenge for Russia In recent days, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reportedly visited Moscow, while the leaders of Russia and Iran engaged in telephone discussions, as did the foreign ministers of these countries and Turkey. The successes of opposition forces pose a challenge for Russia, which has consistently supported the Assad regime.

In the report, shared exclusively with Reuters, the Syria Justice and Accountability Center said it identified the grave sites by using a combination of witness testimony, satellite imagery and documents photographed at the military airport in the Damascus suburb of Mezzeh after the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad in December.\\n--------------------------------------------------\"</result></tool_use_result>"

    "system": "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question. \\\nYou can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.\n\n## Tool Use Formatting\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Execute safe mathematical expressions.\\n\\nSupports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **) and common mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc.).\\nFor security reasons, only mathematical expressions are allowed, no arbitrary code execution.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Mathematical expression to calculate, e.g., \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\", \\\"sin(30 * pi / 180)\\\", \\\"sqrt(16)\\\"\"}}, \"required\": [\"expression\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n"
