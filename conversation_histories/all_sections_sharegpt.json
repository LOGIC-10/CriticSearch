Consequently, the country's involvement is multifaceted and deeply entwined with its regional strategies:\n\n- **Military Support**: Iran, alongside Russia, has provided critical military support to the Assad regime. This support has included airstrikes and troop deployments which have been instrumental in key battles, such as the capture of Aleppo in November 2024. This involvement underscores Iran's commitment to sustaining the Assad regime and countering opposition offensives <citation>https://www.armyrecognition.com/focus-analysis-conflicts/army/conflicts-in-the-world/syria-conflict-news/iran-and-russia-to-support-syrian-regime-with-airstrikes-and-troop-deployments</citation>.\n\n- **Strategic Alliance**: Iran's alliance with Syria is rooted in a broader strategy to maintain the \"Axis of Resistance,\" which aligns with Tehran's geopolitical interests in West Asia. This alliance is deemed vital for Iran to project its influence and counteract the influence of rival nations in the region <citation>https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/506992/Iran-s-strategic-resolve-defending-Syria-and-Axis-of-Resistance</citation>.\n\n- **Proxy Warfare**: Iran employs proxy warfare tactics, notably through groups like Hezbollah, to fortify its position within Syria. This strategy not only supports the Assad regime but also enhances Iran's regional foothold <citation>https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/irans-terrorism-a-threat-to-syrias-stability/</citation>.\n\nIran's involvement is dual-faceted, involving direct military actions and strategic support through proxies, all aimed at sustaining the Assad regime and extending its influence across the region. These activities remain a cornerstone of Iran's foreign policy objectives amid the complex dynamics of the Syrian conflict.\n</answer>"

You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.\n\n## Tool Use Formatting\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool.

The country’s new rulers have been trying to pave the way for a political transitional process. Regional countries also do not stay idle in this new period. Some regional countries have already started engaging in political talks with HTS and its allies through the Department of Political Affairs of the new government in the country. So far, meetings have been held with ambassadors of Iraq, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt, UAE, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Italy. It was also announced that Qatar would soon open its embassy in Damascus.\\n\\nIt is safe to say that following the December 8th Revolution, Iran (and its proxies) emerged as the biggest losers along with the deposed Assad regime after the sweeping offensive led by HTS and Türkiye-backed Syrian rebels started on November 27th and ended on December 8th. Russia’s influence in the country has also shrunk. Nonetheless, it is still in a better position than Iran.\\n\\nIn an environment where developments are unfolding rapidly, it is essential to enumerate and understand the stances of Syrian, regional, and global actors to forecast what may come next.\\n\\nSyrian Actors:\\n\\nAfter the revolution, Syria is de facto divided into two main axes: Opposition forces (the new administration in Damascus) and the Syrian Democratic Forces. The new government controls approximately 70 percent of the country, while SDF controls around 30 percent. The SDF was expelled from Western Euphrates (Tel Rıf’at and Manbij) through the Türkiye-backed Syrian National Army’s ‘Operation Freedom Dawn’. In addition, the SDF withdrew from the Western Bank of Deir ez-Zour after the local Arab population revolted against it. In the upcoming period, the Arab-populated Eastern Syria will likely face new revolts, leading to the shrinking of the SDF control zones. New clashes between the SNA forces and SDF seem to be underway. A wing from the SDF’s Deir Ez-Zour Military Council also defected from it and joined the HTS-allied coalition. That said, SDF is trying to reach out to Damascus and cut a deal with HTS. By deciding to raise the flag of revolution, the SDF is trying to reconcile with HTS in the post-Assad regime era.\\n\\nOn the other side, the HTS-backed Syrian Salvation Government’s Prime Minister Mohammad Bashir has been appointed as the transitional period Prime Minister in the country, with a mandate that will expire on March 1, 2025. The transitional Prime Minister has already met with the HTS-backed Salvation Government’s and the ousted regime’s ministers in a meeting.\\n\\nAlthough the situation on the ground seems to be on track among the new rulers of Syria, it is beyond doubt that they will vie for power in the upcoming period. Thus, a challenging period is ahead. And the new government has no option but to share power among different actors.\\n\\nRegional Actors:\\n\\nTürkiye\\n\\nTürkiye emerged as the primary winner in the recent developments. The triumph of the new rulers of Syria is likely to incentivize a big chunk of the Syrian refugees in Türkiye to return to their homeland. Moreover, Türkiye also found the chance to clear SDF from the Western Euphrates, and it is now doubling down to do the same in the Eastern Euphrates in an effort to guarantee the safety of its southern borders due to the threats it has been perceiving from the SDF. Türkiye will also likely increase its trade activities with Syria as the dust settles slowly in the upcoming period.\\n\\nDiplomatically, Türkiye was also the first country to send its officials to Damascus. The Turkish Intelligence Chief Ibrahim Kalın visited Damascus and held meetings with the new faces of the government in Damascus. Additionally, Türkiye has appointed Burhan Köroğlu as the charge d’affaires to Damascus, and opened its embassy after 12 years of hiatus.\\n\\nIran\\n\\nIran is undoubtedly the biggest loser in recent events. Iranian influence and investments through the sectarian militias and billions of dollars that Tehran has invested in Syria have evaporated during the lightning offensive. As a result, Tehran abandoned Bashar al-Assad to its fate following the blows that it had to deal with in the aftermath of the repercussions of the 7th of October. The Iranian officials continue to frame the revolution in Syria as an American-Israeli plot. Moreover, they also interchangeably accuse the Syrian regime, Türkiye, and Russia.\\n\\nAlthough Iran has softened the rhetoric towards the new rulers of Syria, it is implausible that the new government in Syria will have a positive relationship with Iran due to Tehran’s track record of destroying Syria by supporting al-Assad via IRGC and Shiite militias from many countries including Afghanistan and Pakistan. Nonetheless, Iranian officials still claim that they got guarantees from the new administration in Damascus regarding the security of their embassy. Thus, they are willing to reopen it soon.\\n\\nIraq\\n\\nIn recent years, amid a series of political and regional shifts, Iraq has adopted a more introspective approach, leaning toward disengagement from external conflicts.\\n\\nIraqi officials have increasingly focused on preventing the spillover effects of the Syrian conflict from impacting their own country. As part of this strategy, Iraq has closed its borders with Syria to limit potential security threats, particularly following the arrival of around 4,000 Syrian soldiers who fled their military service. Various Iraqi factions remain on edge as they await new political leadership in Syria while maintaining a cautious stance by avoiding direct involvement in regional power struggles.\\n\\nThis cautious approach reflects the socio-economic internal fatigue and broader regional trends, such as Iran’s setbacks, which affected its proxies in the region in their regional role as well as their domestic power.\\n\\nLebanon\\n\\nOn the official front, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has called for Lebanon to distance itself from the Syrian conflict and to secure its borders at a time when the country has yet to recover from its war with Israel, and the ceasefire agreement remains fragile. After ensuring stability in the south, the Lebanese hope that the upcoming presidential election, scheduled for January 9th, will pave the way for recovery and the restoration of institutional order, beginning with the election of a president.\\n\\nHowever, the fall of the Syrian regime is expected to embolden the Lebanese opposition forces against Hezbollah and its allies, reflecting a regional weakening of the organization. In response, Hezbollah is likely to cling more firmly to its socio-political role in Lebanon, seeing it as its last chance. This dynamic suggests that Lebanon is poised for a period of political tension and power struggles before reaching stability as the political landscape is reshaped to reflect the shifting balance of regional power. On the other hand, focus is expected to increase on the return of Syrian refugees, who number more than two million, as the reasons for their displacement have diminished.\\n\\nJordan\\n\\nJordan initially supported the Assad regime during the Syrian rebels’ offensive. Later, it changed the rhetoric and welcomed the change in the country. Also, the Jordanian ambassador in Damascus met with the new rulers of Syria.\\n\\nMany Arab countries fear the return of the specter of the uprisings or a second rise of the Islamists that could threaten their rule, similar to the initial rise following the Arab Spring revolts.\\n\\nFor Jordan, in addition to these fears, its primary focus regarding Syria over the past years has been controlling borders and halting smuggling operations, a goal it has pursued through engagement with the Assad regime without achieving the desired outcomes. After the Assad regime’s downfall, Jordan, through its officials, expressed its readiness “to provide any assistance needed by the brotherly Syrian people.” Jordan fears that Syria might “slide into chaos,” a scenario that poses a major concern for maintaining security and stability within Jordan itself. In addition, Jordan has not hidden its concerns, as expressed by its officials, about the Israeli advances in Syria, which naturally represent a threat to Jordan’s security. Therefore, it is expected to see more significant Jordanian engagement with Syria’s new rulers, especially regarding border issues.\\n\\nEgypt\\n\\nEgypt’s response to the fall of the Syrian regime was cautious and delayed. When it came, the Egyptian Foreign Minister described the situation as a “change” and affirmed Egypt’s willingness to assist in easing the suffering of the Syrian people, supporting safe refugee returns, and participating in reconstruction efforts.\\n\\nAs a leading opponent of political Islam, Egypt remains deeply concerned about the transformation in Syria, fearing a second Arab spring wave, especially with Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group, at the forefront of the change in Syria. Also, the Egyptian leaders fear the potential spread of jihadist movements, which could threaten its governance or compromise national security.\\n\\nDespite economic challenges, Egypt has faced relatively fewer issues with its Syrian refugee population than other nations. However, it sees an opportunity to strengthen its economy and reclaim some of the regional influence it has lost in recent years by supporting refugee returns and participating in reconstruction efforts.

The country is now primarily divided between the new administration in Damascus, backed by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Türkiye, and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The new government controls approximately 70% of the country, while SDF controls about 30%. The ongoing power dynamics are complicated by the rebellious actions from Arab populations against SDF control, hinting at potential future conflicts.\n\nThe new rulers in Damascus, led by HTS, are focused on consolidating power through transitional governance. An HTS-backed Prime Minister, Mohammad Bashir, has been appointed for the transitional period set to end in March 2025. Despite having a functioning government, power struggles are anticipated as multiple factions negotiate their roles in the new Syria.\n\nDomestically, the transition is seen as an opportunity to rebuild, but the path is fraught with challenges given the histories of conflict and division within the country. Engaging with various factions and ensuring stable governance will be critical for the nation's future as it attempts to move away from over six decades of autocratic rule under the Assad regime <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/17/domestic-regional-and-international-reactions-to-the-syrian-revolution/</citation>.\n</answer>"

You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.\n\n## Tool Use Formatting\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n"

In late November and early December, opposition forces made substantial gains against government troops, capturing key regions and reigniting the conflict that had been in a stalemate for years.\n\n1. **Strategic Seizures:**\n   - Opposition forces, including the Syrian National Army (SNA), Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), rapidly advanced in northern Syria. Key strategic gains occurred in Aleppo and Hama, with the rebels capturing 20 villages <citation>https://tribune.com.pk/story/2514760/turmoil-in-syria-continues-after-assad-flees-countr</citation>.\n\n2. **Key Players and Support:**\n   - The SNA, backed by Turkey, played a significant role in northern Syria. Their success highlighted their capability to control key regions despite pressures from Assad-aligned forces and external actors like Russia <citation>https://genesysdefense.com/intl/advancements-and-strategic-shifts-syrian-rebel-operations-in-november-2024/</citation>.\n\n3. **Incidents and Reactions:**\n   - The opposition's capture of Aleppo on November 28, 2024, underscored the intense fighting in northwestern Syria. This further strained Assad's forces, which struggled to maintain control against the opposition's offensive <citation>https://www.newsweek.com/syrian-opposition-forces-advance-aleppo-amid-heavy-fighting-1993364</citation>.\n\nThese opening advances not only shifted territorial control but also pressured international stakeholders, including Turkey and Russia, to reassess their strategies and involvement in the region.\n</answer>"

This massive rebel advance has resulted in incredible regime material losses - with almost all equipment being captured, not destroyed - making its losses extra painful for the regime and its allies (Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah) because now all those captured weapons and munitions can be used against their former owners.\\nThis is only the latest case of the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) being the biggest supplier of weapons and ammo to the forces it has been fighting. But the amount of equipment and munitions captured from the regime forces during this rout from Aleppo and Idlib governorates has been unprecedented. And it isnt just quantity of weapons - rebel captures include a whole collection of powerful and complex weapons like fighter jets (even if only some of the captured ones are likely operational), long range MRLS, and SAM systems. While using these weapons systems will be difficult for rebels, if they mamage to make operational even just some of them, it would pose a serious problem for the regime military and its allies.\\nA detailed list of the destroyed and captured heavy weapons can be seen below.  \\nThis list only includes captured vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available. Therefore, the amount of equipment destroyed or captured by Syrian rebel forces is undoubtedly higher than recorded here. Losses of trucks, jeeps, etc. might be added later. Small arms and munitions are not included in this list to preserve the sanity of people documenting regime losses.  \\nThis list will be updated as additional footage becomes available.\\nNote: this list will at least for now list only equipment losses that happened on or before the regime collapse in Hama on December 5th 2024 - depending on the later events, this list might later be expanded, but if the regime falls, there would be no point in listing literally everything that the regimes military osed to own.\\n(Click on the numbers to get a picture of each individual captured or

He added that insurgents were headed from southern Syria toward the city.\\n\\nLone suspect charged with murdering two Israeli embassy staff in shooting near Jewish museum in Washington\\n\\nMore than 350 lawyers and academics say Government not complying with international law obligations over Palestine crisis\\n\\nAid trucks enter Gaza after delays as pressure mounts on Israel\\n\\nNetanyahu’s promise of Israel’s ‘total victory’ over Hamas is likely to remain elusive dream\\n\\nThe rebels, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militant group, earlier said they had reached the edge of the central city of Homs as government forces attempted to buttress collapsing front lines and preserve Bashar al-Assad’s 24-year rule. Syria’s state news agency denied rumours that Assad has left the country, saying he is at work in Damascus.\\n\\nThe leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a former al Qaeda affiliate, said in a video message on Saturday that the rebels were “in the final moments of liberating” Homs.\\n\\nSince the rebels’ sweep into Aleppo a week ago, government defences have crumbled across the country at dizzying speed as insurgents rose up in places where the rebellion had long seemed over. Besides capturing Aleppo in the north, Hama in the centre and Deir al-Zor in the east, rebels took contol of Suweida and Deraa.\\n\\nSyria’s military said it was carrying out air strikes around Hama and Homs and reinforcing on that front. It also said it was repositioning around Deraa and Suweida, without acknowledging their capture by rebels.\\n\\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday it was inadmissible to allow what he called a terrorist group to take control of Syrian lands. He was speaking in Doha, Qatar after meeting the Turkish and Iranian foreign ministers.\\n\\nRussia, a long-term ally of Syria, intervened in 2015 to prop up Damascus during Syria’s civil war, which began in 2011. It maintains a military presence in Syria, including a naval base and airbases in the cities of Tartus and Latakia, in the coastal region that is a stronghold of Assad’s Alawite sect.\\n\\nMr Lavrov said Russia would “help the Syrian army to counter the attacks of terrorists”.\\n\\nThe UN’s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called for urgent talks to ensure an “orderly political transition”.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters at the annual Doha Forum, he said the talks in Geneva, Switzerland would discuss the implementation of a UN resolution that called for a Syrian-led political process. Resolution 2254, adopted in 2015, called for the establishment of a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with UN-supervised elections.\\n\\nThe pace of events in Syria has stunned Arab capitals, western officials say, raising their fears of a fresh wave of regional instability.\\n\\nSyria's civil war, which erupted in 2011 as an uprising against Assad's rule, dragged in big outside powers, created space for jihadist militants to plot attacks around the world and sent millions of refugees into neighbouring states.\\n\\nAssad had long relied on allies to subdue the rebels, with Russian warplanes bombing from the skies while Iran sent allied forces including Lebanon’s Hizbullah and Iraqi militia to bolster the Syrian military and storm insurgent strongholds.\\n\\nBut Russia has been focused on the war in Ukraine since 2022 and Hizbullah’s leadership has been decimated this year in its own gruelling war with Israel.\\n\\nHizbullah sent some “supervising forces” to Homs on Friday but any significant deployment would risk exposure to Israeli air strikes, western officials said. Israel attacked two Lebanon-Syria border crossings on Friday, Lebanon said.\\n\\nIran-backed Iraqi militias are on high alert, with thousands of heavily armed fighters ready to deploy to Syria, many of them amassed near the border. But they have not yet been ordered to cross, two of their commanders said. Iraq does not seek military intervention in Syria, a government spokesman said on Friday.\\n\\nQatar’s minister for foreign affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said there had been no serious effort by Assad to reconcile with his own people and that civil war threatened Syria’s territorial integrity. – Reuters\\n\\nIN THIS SECTION\\n\\nAid trucks enter Gaza after delays as pressure mounts on Israel\\n\\nNetanyahu’s promise of Israel’s ‘total victory’ over Hamas is likely to remain elusive dream\\n\\nHumanitarian agencies warn aid still not getting into Gaza\\n\\nStarving Gazans still waiting for food as Israel defies rising international pressure\\n\\nThe little-known group poised to take over Gaza’s aid\\n\\nMOST READ\\n\\nFlight carrying ‘barbaric’ deportees from US to Africa stopped at Shannon Airport\\n\\nMichael Gaine case update: Gardaí recover chainsaw and more body parts from yard of murdered farmer\\n\\nLook inside: Shane Ross and Ruth Buchanan selling Enniskerry home for €3.5m\\n\\n‘You’d see the rats everywhere’: Removal of one of Dublin’s largest illegal landfills begins\\n\\nLone suspect charged with murdering two Israeli embassy staff in shooting near Jewish museum in Washington\\n\\nLATEST STORIES\\n\\nLone suspect charged with murdering two Israeli embassy staff in shooting near Jewish museum in Washington\\n\\nPolicing plan in place for Kneecap’s surprise London gig, Met says\\n\\nMore than 350 lawyers and academics say Government not complying with international law obligations over Palestine crisis\\n\\nCamogie Association Special Congress passes motion to allow players to wear shorts\\n\\nThe Irish Times view on the war in Gaza: the world is still standing by\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\nSupport\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nIrish Times Products & Services\\n\\nOUR PARTNERS:\\n\\n© 2025 The Irish Times DAC\\n\\n\\n\"</result></tool_use_result>"

With Syrian dictator Bashar Assad now overthrown, what role will Turkey play in Syria's political transition? \\\"Compared to the situation two weeks ago, Turkey has definitely won in Syria,\\\" said Zaur Gasimov, an expert in Turkish-Russian relations at the Turkish-German University in Istanbul. \\\"Although Turkey's politics toward Syria had long been dismissed as unsuccessful, Erdogan kept repeating that one day, Assad would lose power. Turkey supports the Syrian National Army, which now controls large parts of northern Syria. Now, forces supported by Turkey are moving against Kurdish militias, and have captured swaths of northern Syria, including the town of Manbij.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: How Turkey aims to capitalise on Syria's rebel offensive\\nURL: https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-turkey-aims-capitalise-syrias-rebel-offensive\\nCONTENT: Turkey has officially denied any involvement in the offensives, which saw the regime in Damascus lose swathes of territory in northwestern Syria in an attack led by former Al-Qaeda affiliate Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Turkey-backed militias of the Syrian National Army (SNA), which are in control of much of northern Syria. “Turkey's goal in this strategically is to get the refugees back into Syria from Turkey, so they need quiet along the border,” he tells The New Arab. A large portion of the population in Turkey holds a negative view of refugees, perceiving the policy of hosting migrants as a strain on the country's struggling economy, despite it receiving significant financial support from Brussels since 2016 to manage the Syrian refugee crisis.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Reconsidering Turkey's Influence on the Syrian Conflict\\nURL: https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/reconsidering-turkeys-influence-syrian-conflict\\nCONTENT: A closer look at the evolution of Turkeyâs Syria policy reveals that Ankara has not shaped the course of developments after it lost the primary initiative to the US and Russian interventions in Syria.Â Since the mid-2010s, Turkey has played into the US-Russian competition to secure its military presence in Syria against non-state threats and the risk of another large influx of refugees. It seems that Assadâs rapid fall could not have been foreseen by many global and regional actors, including Turkey.Â Some reports suggest that Turkey was informed of the presence of an attack plan by HTS six months ago, but Ankara did not endorse it, fearing that such a move would re-escalate the war between the regime and rebel groups and lead to a growing refugee flow from Syria.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: The complex nature of Turkey's relations with Syria\\nURL: https://globalvoices.org/2024/12/24/the-complex-nature-of-turkeys-relations-with-syria/\\nCONTENT: The violence erupted a mere two weeks after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad expressed interest in resuming talks — Turkey severed its ties in 2011 in the aftermath of the Syrian Civil War. In response to violence in Syrian neighborhoods in Turkey, images of burnt Turkish flags and counter-protests were reported to have taken place in northwestern Syria, including in those areas controlled by Turkish-backed forces. For Assad's regime, which was backed by Russia and Iran, reconciliation involved Turkey pulling out all of its 10,000 troops and its support of rebel forces in northern Syria — “a precondition Ankara has called unacceptable, citing security concerns over Syrian Kurdish militants,” according to reporting of seasoned journalist Burcu Karakas for Reuters at the time.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[6]:\\nTITLE: Turkey expected to play a major role in Syria following fall of the ...\\nURL: https://www.npr.org/2024/12/27/nx-s1-5238277/turkey-expected-to-play-a-major-role-in-syria-following-fall-of-the-assad-regime\\nCONTENT: For more on Syria's future and Turkey's influence, we turn now to NPR's Hadeel Al-Shalchi in Damascus and NPR's Fatma Tanis in Istanbul.

It geographically adjoins Syrian rebel territory in the northwest, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government supported the 2011 Arab Spring uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. This situation will either result in the regime in Damascus collapsing or in an unstable stalemate characterized by the regime forces, helped by pro-Iranian militias from Iraq and Hezbollah, halting rebel advances but unable to reclaim Aleppo or Hama back.

The UK Government and the European Union have both welcomed the declaration of a new Syrian Government and its commitment to elections and the rights of minorities.

The collapse of the fifty-year Assad dynasty has ushered in a period of political transition in Syria, reshaping not only domestic governance but the geopolitical calculus of key players involved in the proxy conflict.

After the Assad regime’s downfall, Jordan, through its officials, expressed its readiness “to provide any assistance needed by the brotherly Syrian people.” Jordan fears that Syria might “slide into chaos,” a scenario that poses a major concern for maintaining security and stability within Jordan itself.

Resolving this dilemma requires the new Syrian government to take several steps, including: providing international guarantees not to deal with groups designated as terrorists; implementing effective policies to combat violent extremism and ensure the state’s monopoly on weapons; enhancing transparency in the management of international aid; and opening up to individuals from the civil political and opposition forces that have a role in running the government to rebuild international confidence and gradually lift economic sanctions.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: Syria in Focus: Regional and International Dynamics at a Crossroads\\nURL: https://carnegieendowment.org/events/2024/12/syria-in-focus-regional-and-international-dynamics-at-a-crossroads\\nCONTENT: Senior policy fellow and deputy head of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags.

By supporting the Syrian regime, Iraq secures its borders, preventing the spread of influence from Sunni rebels or Kurdish groups, which are viewed as threats to Iraq’s internal stability. However, Turkey’s involvement in Syria places it in opposition to other regional powers, such as Russia and Iran, which support Assad’s regime.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[8]:\\nTITLE: Conflict in Syria | Global Conflict Tracker - Council on Foreign Relations\\nURL: https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-syria\\nCONTENT: Together, these nations have conducted over eleven thousand air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, while the U.S.-led coalition has continued its support for ground operations by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.\n\n## Tool Use Formatting\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n"

Fighters from various rebel factions, including a group linked to Al Qaeda called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, had advanced by Wednesday to within about six miles of Aleppo and taken over weapons and vehicles previously held by forces loyal to the government of President Bashar al-Assad, according to the monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. “Pro-regime militias have been upping their attacks in the area, trying to deter the rebels because Israel has been weakening the Syrian regime’s allies like Hezbollah and Iran,” said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an ...\\nURL: https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and\\nCONTENT: The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an opportunity for Turkey and a challenge for Russia | OSW Centre for Eastern Studies The successful offensive of the Syrian opposition forces: an opportunity for Turkey and a challenge for Russia In recent days, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reportedly visited Moscow, while the leaders of Russia and Iran engaged in telephone discussions, as did the foreign ministers of these countries and Turkey.

The official Russian news agency TASS cited the Syrian army command in a report Sunday as saying that their air forces “stepped up strikes on terrorist positions and their supply lines, with dozens killed and wounded.” The White Helmets said at least four people were killed on Sunday in airstrikes on Idlib city, a province that now appears to be entirely in rebel hands.

The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n"

The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline. The string is intended for model consumption\\n    and retains original <note>...</note> formatting.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        None\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        str: All notes concatenated with '\\n', or an empty string if none exist.\\n\\n    Raises:\\n        RuntimeError: If session_id is not set.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {}, \"required\": [], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}]\n\n## Tool Use Rules\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n"
