In these regions, the main political players include the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), the Socialist Party (PS), and Écolo, alongside emerging parties such as the Belgian Workers' Party (PTB).\n\nIn Wallonia, the MR experienced a notable surge in support, becoming the largest French-speaking party for the first time in many years, capturing approximately 26% of the vote. This was a substantial increase from their 2019 performance, which only garnered around 16.9% of the votes. The PS, historically a dominant force in French-speaking politics, suffered a decline, securing only about 8.05% of votes and losing several seats, which underscored a shift in the political landscape toward more liberal governance within the French-speaking community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>.\n\nIn Brussels, the voting dynamics reflected a similar pattern with MR leading the French-speaking candidates, followed closely by the PTB and the PS. The latter faced setbacks, indicating a change in voter preferences and priorities that were heavily influenced by issues such as migration and civil rights, which have gained prominence in recent electoral debates <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected</citation>.\n\nThe significant outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies pointed to an overall political realignment in Belgium, where voters showed a tendency towards more centrist and liberal parties amid a backdrop of growing right-wing sentiments throughout the country. This shift may have substantial implications for the formation of the next government, as coalition-building will be essential in navigating the divided political landscape brought forth by this election cycle <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nAs parties continue to navigate the results, it remains to be seen how these shifts will influence not just local governance but also federal coalitions and policies moving forward into the post-election period.\n</answer>"

        "value": "<answer>\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal election approaches, opinion polls are becoming increasingly significant in gauging potential voting patterns and political preferences among the electorate. Various polling organizations have conducted surveys to assess the public's voting intentions, with results indicating a competitive political landscape.\n\nAccording to the latest Ipsos poll conducted between November 18 and 21, 2024, the following voting intentions emerged: the liberal party Mouvement Réformateur (MR) leads with 27.4%, followed by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%, the Environmentalist party Ecolo at 8.1%, and the Leftist party PVDA/PTB at 12.9% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/61534/ipsos/2024-11-21</citation>. This data reflects the diverse political affiliations within Belgium, where voters are influenced by both regional and ideological divides.\n\nAnalysis of the polling data indicates that Flemish parties, particularly the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), have historically fared well in previous elections. The N-VA continues to play a pivotal role in Flemish politics, appealing to a significant portion of the electorate. However, the radical right party Vlaams Belang also maintains a considerable support base, presenting a challenge to traditional parties in Flanders.\n\nIn contrast, the political landscape in Wallonia is dominated by different dynamics, primarily shaped by the PS and MR. Recent polls show that these parties are vying for votes as they attempt to expand their influence across Belgium. The diversity of party support underscores the complexity of Belgian politics, where coalition-building remains a crucial aspect of governance <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nOverall, as the election date approaches on June 9, 2024, the opinion polls highlight not only the shifting preferences among the electorate but also the potential for unexpected outcomes, as historical voting patterns may not entirely predict future results. Close observation of these trends will be essential to understanding the implications for Belgium's governance in the coming years.\n</answer>"

In these regions, the main political players include the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), the Socialist Party (PS), and Écolo, alongside emerging parties such as the Belgian Workers' Party (PTB).\n\nIn Wallonia, the MR experienced a notable surge in support, becoming the largest French-speaking party for the first time in many years, capturing approximately 26% of the vote. This was a substantial increase from their 2019 performance, which only garnered around 16.9% of the votes. The PS, historically a dominant force in French-speaking politics, suffered a decline, securing only about 8.05% of votes and losing several seats, which underscored a shift in the political landscape toward more liberal governance within the French-speaking community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>.\n\nIn Brussels, the voting dynamics reflected a similar pattern with MR leading the French-speaking candidates, followed closely by the PTB and the PS. The latter faced setbacks, indicating a change in voter preferences and priorities that were heavily influenced by issues such as migration and civil rights, which have gained prominence in recent electoral debates <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected</citation>.\n\nThe significant outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies pointed to an overall political realignment in Belgium, where voters showed a tendency towards more centrist and liberal parties amid a backdrop of growing right-wing sentiments throughout the country. This shift may have substantial implications for the formation of the next government, as coalition-building will be essential in navigating the divided political landscape brought forth by this election cycle <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nAs parties continue to navigate the results, it remains to be seen how these shifts will influence not just local governance but also federal coalitions and policies moving forward into the post-election period.\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal election approaches, opinion polls are becoming increasingly significant in gauging potential voting patterns and political preferences among the electorate. Various polling organizations have conducted surveys to assess the public's voting intentions, with results indicating a competitive political landscape.\n\nAccording to the latest Ipsos poll conducted between November 18 and 21, 2024, the following voting intentions emerged: the liberal party Mouvement Réformateur (MR) leads with 27.4%, followed by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%, the Environmentalist party Ecolo at 8.1%, and the Leftist party PVDA/PTB at 12.9% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/61534/ipsos/2024-11-21</citation>. This data reflects the diverse political affiliations within Belgium, where voters are influenced by both regional and ideological divides.\n\nAnalysis of the polling data indicates that Flemish parties, particularly the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), have historically fared well in previous elections. The N-VA continues to play a pivotal role in Flemish politics, appealing to a significant portion of the electorate. However, the radical right party Vlaams Belang also maintains a considerable support base, presenting a challenge to traditional parties in Flanders.\n\nIn contrast, the political landscape in Wallonia is dominated by different dynamics, primarily shaped by the PS and MR. Recent polls show that these parties are vying for votes as they attempt to expand their influence across Belgium. The diversity of party support underscores the complexity of Belgian politics, where coalition-building remains a crucial aspect of governance <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nOverall, as the election date approaches on June 9, 2024, the opinion polls highlight not only the shifting preferences among the electorate but also the potential for unexpected outcomes, as historical voting patterns may not entirely predict future results. Close observation of these trends will be essential to understanding the implications for Belgium's governance in the coming years.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Background\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

This election, characterized by a significant rise in populism, notably from right-leaning parties, reflects a broader trend observed across Europe. The elections will not only determine the composition of the federal government but will also impact local governance and Belgium's role within the European Union.\n\nVoter turnout is expected to be a critical issue, as early polls suggest one of the lowest participation rates in history for a compulsory voting country. This marks a departure from the norm since compulsory voting was introduced in Belgium over a century ago. The implications of such low engagement could reverberate throughout the nation's political future, risking the validity of the newly formed government.\n\nWith approximately 6,550 candidates set to contest for various positions, including those in the federal parliament, regional assemblies, and the European Parliament, the election will provide a diverse slate for Belgian citizens to choose from.

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件，要求简单清晰即可\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, were marked by significant political shifts within the French-speaking constituencies, specifically in Wallonia and Brussels. In these regions, the main political players include the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), the Socialist Party (PS), and Écolo, alongside emerging parties such as the Belgian Workers' Party (PTB).\n\nIn Wallonia, the MR experienced a notable surge in support, becoming the largest French-speaking party for the first time in many years, capturing approximately 26% of the vote. This was a substantial increase from their 2019 performance, which only garnered around 16.9% of the votes. The PS, historically a dominant force in French-speaking politics, suffered a decline, securing only about 8.05% of votes and losing several seats, which underscored a shift in the political landscape toward more liberal governance within the French-speaking community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>.\n\nIn Brussels, the voting dynamics reflected a similar pattern with MR leading the French-speaking candidates, followed closely by the PTB and the PS. The latter faced setbacks, indicating a change in voter preferences and priorities that were heavily influenced by issues such as migration and civil rights, which have gained prominence in recent electoral debates <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected</citation>.\n\nThe significant outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies pointed to an overall political realignment in Belgium, where voters showed a tendency towards more centrist and liberal parties amid a backdrop of growing right-wing sentiments throughout the country. This shift may have substantial implications for the formation of the next government, as coalition-building will be essential in navigating the divided political landscape brought forth by this election cycle <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nAs parties continue to navigate the results, it remains to be seen how these shifts will influence not just local governance but also federal coalitions and policies moving forward into the post-election period.\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal election approaches, opinion polls are becoming increasingly significant in gauging potential voting patterns and political preferences among the electorate. Various polling organizations have conducted surveys to assess the public's voting intentions, with results indicating a competitive political landscape.\n\nAccording to the latest Ipsos poll conducted between November 18 and 21, 2024, the following voting intentions emerged: the liberal party Mouvement Réformateur (MR) leads with 27.4%, followed by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%, the Environmentalist party Ecolo at 8.1%, and the Leftist party PVDA/PTB at 12.9% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/61534/ipsos/2024-11-21</citation>. This data reflects the diverse political affiliations within Belgium, where voters are influenced by both regional and ideological divides.\n\nAnalysis of the polling data indicates that Flemish parties, particularly the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), have historically fared well in previous elections. The N-VA continues to play a pivotal role in Flemish politics, appealing to a significant portion of the electorate. However, the radical right party Vlaams Belang also maintains a considerable support base, presenting a challenge to traditional parties in Flanders.\n\nIn contrast, the political landscape in Wallonia is dominated by different dynamics, primarily shaped by the PS and MR. Recent polls show that these parties are vying for votes as they attempt to expand their influence across Belgium. The diversity of party support underscores the complexity of Belgian politics, where coalition-building remains a crucial aspect of governance <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nOverall, as the election date approaches on June 9, 2024, the opinion polls highlight not only the shifting preferences among the electorate but also the potential for unexpected outcomes, as historical voting patterns may not entirely predict future results. Close observation of these trends will be essential to understanding the implications for Belgium's governance in the coming years.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are scheduled to take place on June 9, marking a pivotal moment in Belgium's political landscape. This election will be the first federal vote post-pandemic, a period characterized by increased political polarization and shifting voter sentiments. Historical context reveals that these elections could see one of the lowest turnouts since the introduction of compulsory voting in 1893, reflecting lingering public discontent and disengagement with the political process <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nThis election is notable for the significant shift towards right-leaning politics, highlighted by the rise of populist and far-right parties such as Vlaams Belang (VB) and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA). Polls indicate that these parties are likely to dominate the Flemish vote, echoing a broader trend observed across Europe during this electoral cycle, where far-right parties have increasingly garnered support <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>. Such trends signal potential changes in governance, as parties may need to engage in complex coalition-building to secure majorities amid a fragmented political environment.\n\nThe federal elections will not only influence national policy but also affect Belgium's intricate system of federalism, where regional and linguistic divisions often complicate governance. The results will dictate the formation of various coalitions, both at the federal level and within the regions, leading to potential shifts in Belgium's political direction and the fate of ongoing crises such as migration, economic recovery post-COVID, and integration within the European Union <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n\nUnderstanding the landscape ahead of the elections requires an examination of the motivations of the electorate, the manifestos of competing parties, and the possible implications of electoral outcomes. As voter preferences evolve, the significance of these elections cannot be understated, making them a key focus for both national and international observers alike <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation>.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to take place on June 9, marking a pivotal moment in the country's political landscape as it navigates the post-pandemic recovery. This election, characterized by a significant rise in populism, notably from right-leaning parties, reflects a broader trend observed across Europe. The elections will not only determine the composition of the federal government but will also impact local governance and Belgium's role within the European Union.\n\nVoter turnout is expected to be a critical issue, as early polls suggest one of the lowest participation rates in history for a compulsory voting country. This marks a departure from the norm since compulsory voting was introduced in Belgium over a century ago. The implications of such low engagement could reverberate throughout the nation's political future, risking the validity of the newly formed government.\n\nWith approximately 6,550 candidates set to contest for various positions, including those in the federal parliament, regional assemblies, and the European Parliament, the election will provide a diverse slate for Belgian citizens to choose from. The political discourse leading up to the elections has been heavily influenced by pressing issues such as immigration, economic reform, and national identity, largely driven by polarizing parties, notably the far-right Vlaams Belang and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) in Flanders.\n\nThe results of the elections will be crucial not just for immediate governance but for the formation of coalitions, which have historically been complex and lengthy in Belgium. The electorate will be keenly watching to see how the balance of power shifts and what this means for the country's socio-economic policies and its strategic direction within the EU. As voters head to the polls, the outcomes will undoubtedly shape the narrative of Belgian politics for years to come.\n\nOverall, the 2024 Belgian federal elections serve as a significant barometer of public sentiment, showcasing the challenges and opportunities facing contemporary Belgium amid a rapidly changing political climate and the broader socio-economic context.<citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation><citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation><citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-whats-at-stake-for-the-belgian-people</citation>\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Retiring incumbents\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

On the opposite side, the right and centre-right parties harboured a landslide victory totalling 26 seats for MR and 17 seats for Les Engagés in the Walloon Parliament allowing both parties to form a centre-right coalition government.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Listes des candidats | Elections Belgique 2024 - SPF Intérieur ...\\nURL: https://elections.fgov.be/candidats-bulletins-de-vote/listes-des-candidats\\nCONTENT: Elections communales du 13/10/2024 - Statistiques; Logiciel électoral; Agenda électoral; Statistiques; Sécurité et transparence; Dépouillement, répartition des sièges et désignation des élus; Médias; Structure et fonctionnement électoral et parlementaire belges; Étude sur le vote internet; Résultats\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[5]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections for dummies - The Brussels Times\\nURL: https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008651/belgian-elections-for-dummies\\nCONTENT: The previous federal elections in 2019 effectively split Belgium in two as Flanders voted overwhelmingly to the right while the majority in Wallonia voted to the left.

When asked about the reasons behind the Workers' Party's breakthrough in the kingdom's French-speaking community since the previous general elections on 26 May 2019, Emilie van Haute, professor of political science at the Free University of Brussels, explains: \\\"The nature of the public debate is quite different: in Flanders, it is much more focused on migration issues, which is very favourable to Vlaams Belang, the party that has made these issues its main campaign theme.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[3]:\\nTITLE: Belgium: the 2024 federal elections - deadlock ahead?\\nURL: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2024/04/22/belgium-the-2024-federal-elections-deadlock-ahead/\\nCONTENT: Since October 2020, Belgium has been governed by a coalition of seven parties (the so-called “Vivaldi” coalition) – excluding the two largest parties in Flanders, the N-VA and VB – with Alexander De Croo, leading figure of the Open Vld, as prime minister. Recent polls suggest that Vlaams Belang would secure at least a quarter of the votes in Flanders, translating to approximately 25 seats in the federal Chamber of Representatives if elections were held today, making it the largest party in parliament. Another coalition that sporadically gains majority support in the polls is the so-called “Burgundian coalition” with the N-VA, liberals (MR and Open Vld) and socialists (PS and Vooruit), perhaps with the Christian Democrats too.\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n[4]:\\nTITLE: Belgian elections pave way to reform country - POLITICO\\nURL: https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/\\nCONTENT: Forming a Belgian federal government is notoriously difficult.

One key figure stepping back from active politics is Guy Verhofstadt, a prominent member of the Open VLD party and a former Prime Minister of Belgium. Verhofstadt, who has served in various capacities since his election to the Belgian Parliament in 1985, has announced that he will not seek re-election in 2024, marking the end of an era for one of Belgium’s most recognizable political figures <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/494091/former-belgian-pm-guy-verhofstadt-to-retire-from-politics-in-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the 2024 elections were characterized by a growing trend of political fatigue and disillusionment among Belgian politicians, contributing to a wave of retirements from various parties. Many incumbents expressed their desire to leave politics due to burnout and a perception of diminished efficacy in the current political system <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/823083/fatigue-burn-out-disgust-why-belgian-mps-are-leaving-politics</citation>. This phenomenon underscores the broader challenges facing Belgian governance, particularly amidst coalition negotiations and the fragmented nature of the political environment, which has seen increasing polarization among the electorate.\n\nThe departure of established politicians like Verhofstadt indicates a potential shift in party dynamics, as new candidates will likely emerge to fill these positions. The landscape following this election could witness a reconfiguration of alliances and the introduction of fresh policies reflective of the changing priorities of the Belgian populace.\n\nOverall, the retirements of key incumbents during this election cycle highlight critical factors influencing Belgium's political arena, including individual burnout, shifting public sentiments, and the need for renewal in political representation.\n</answer>"

In these regions, the main political players include the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), the Socialist Party (PS), and Écolo, alongside emerging parties such as the Belgian Workers' Party (PTB).\n\nIn Wallonia, the MR experienced a notable surge in support, becoming the largest French-speaking party for the first time in many years, capturing approximately 26% of the vote. This was a substantial increase from their 2019 performance, which only garnered around 16.9% of the votes. The PS, historically a dominant force in French-speaking politics, suffered a decline, securing only about 8.05% of votes and losing several seats, which underscored a shift in the political landscape toward more liberal governance within the French-speaking community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>.\n\nIn Brussels, the voting dynamics reflected a similar pattern with MR leading the French-speaking candidates, followed closely by the PTB and the PS. The latter faced setbacks, indicating a change in voter preferences and priorities that were heavily influenced by issues such as migration and civil rights, which have gained prominence in recent electoral debates <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected</citation>.\n\nThe significant outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies pointed to an overall political realignment in Belgium, where voters showed a tendency towards more centrist and liberal parties amid a backdrop of growing right-wing sentiments throughout the country. This shift may have substantial implications for the formation of the next government, as coalition-building will be essential in navigating the divided political landscape brought forth by this election cycle <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nAs parties continue to navigate the results, it remains to be seen how these shifts will influence not just local governance but also federal coalitions and policies moving forward into the post-election period.\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal election approaches, opinion polls are becoming increasingly significant in gauging potential voting patterns and political preferences among the electorate. Various polling organizations have conducted surveys to assess the public's voting intentions, with results indicating a competitive political landscape.\n\nAccording to the latest Ipsos poll conducted between November 18 and 21, 2024, the following voting intentions emerged: the liberal party Mouvement Réformateur (MR) leads with 27.4%, followed by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%, the Environmentalist party Ecolo at 8.1%, and the Leftist party PVDA/PTB at 12.9% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/61534/ipsos/2024-11-21</citation>. This data reflects the diverse political affiliations within Belgium, where voters are influenced by both regional and ideological divides.\n\nAnalysis of the polling data indicates that Flemish parties, particularly the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), have historically fared well in previous elections. The N-VA continues to play a pivotal role in Flemish politics, appealing to a significant portion of the electorate. However, the radical right party Vlaams Belang also maintains a considerable support base, presenting a challenge to traditional parties in Flanders.\n\nIn contrast, the political landscape in Wallonia is dominated by different dynamics, primarily shaped by the PS and MR. Recent polls show that these parties are vying for votes as they attempt to expand their influence across Belgium. The diversity of party support underscores the complexity of Belgian politics, where coalition-building remains a crucial aspect of governance <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nOverall, as the election date approaches on June 9, 2024, the opinion polls highlight not only the shifting preferences among the electorate but also the potential for unexpected outcomes, as historical voting patterns may not entirely predict future results. Close observation of these trends will be essential to understanding the implications for Belgium's governance in the coming years.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are scheduled to take place on June 9, marking a pivotal moment in Belgium's political landscape. This election will be the first federal vote post-pandemic, a period characterized by increased political polarization and shifting voter sentiments. Historical context reveals that these elections could see one of the lowest turnouts since the introduction of compulsory voting in 1893, reflecting lingering public discontent and disengagement with the political process <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nThis election is notable for the significant shift towards right-leaning politics, highlighted by the rise of populist and far-right parties such as Vlaams Belang (VB) and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA). Polls indicate that these parties are likely to dominate the Flemish vote, echoing a broader trend observed across Europe during this electoral cycle, where far-right parties have increasingly garnered support <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>. Such trends signal potential changes in governance, as parties may need to engage in complex coalition-building to secure majorities amid a fragmented political environment.\n\nThe federal elections will not only influence national policy but also affect Belgium's intricate system of federalism, where regional and linguistic divisions often complicate governance. The results will dictate the formation of various coalitions, both at the federal level and within the regions, leading to potential shifts in Belgium's political direction and the fate of ongoing crises such as migration, economic recovery post-COVID, and integration within the European Union <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n\nUnderstanding the landscape ahead of the elections requires an examination of the motivations of the electorate, the manifestos of competing parties, and the possible implications of electoral outcomes. As voter preferences evolve, the significance of these elections cannot be understated, making them a key focus for both national and international observers alike <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation>.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to take place on June 9, marking a pivotal moment in the country's political landscape as it navigates the post-pandemic recovery. This election, characterized by a significant rise in populism, notably from right-leaning parties, reflects a broader trend observed across Europe. The elections will not only determine the composition of the federal government but will also impact local governance and Belgium's role within the European Union.\n\nVoter turnout is expected to be a critical issue, as early polls suggest one of the lowest participation rates in history for a compulsory voting country. This marks a departure from the norm since compulsory voting was introduced in Belgium over a century ago. The implications of such low engagement could reverberate throughout the nation's political future, risking the validity of the newly formed government.\n\nWith approximately 6,550 candidates set to contest for various positions, including those in the federal parliament, regional assemblies, and the European Parliament, the election will provide a diverse slate for Belgian citizens to choose from. The political discourse leading up to the elections has been heavily influenced by pressing issues such as immigration, economic reform, and national identity, largely driven by polarizing parties, notably the far-right Vlaams Belang and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) in Flanders.\n\nThe results of the elections will be crucial not just for immediate governance but for the formation of coalitions, which have historically been complex and lengthy in Belgium. The electorate will be keenly watching to see how the balance of power shifts and what this means for the country's socio-economic policies and its strategic direction within the EU. As voters head to the polls, the outcomes will undoubtedly shape the narrative of Belgian politics for years to come.\n\nOverall, the 2024 Belgian federal elections serve as a significant barometer of public sentiment, showcasing the challenges and opportunities facing contemporary Belgium amid a rapidly changing political climate and the broader socio-economic context.<citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation><citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation><citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-whats-at-stake-for-the-belgian-people</citation>\n## Retiring Incumbents\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections saw notable shifts in the political landscape, highlighted by significant retirements among incumbents. One key figure stepping back from active politics is Guy Verhofstadt, a prominent member of the Open VLD party and a former Prime Minister of Belgium. Verhofstadt, who has served in various capacities since his election to the Belgian Parliament in 1985, has announced that he will not seek re-election in 2024, marking the end of an era for one of Belgium’s most recognizable political figures <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/494091/former-belgian-pm-guy-verhofstadt-to-retire-from-politics-in-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the 2024 elections were characterized by a growing trend of political fatigue and disillusionment among Belgian politicians, contributing to a wave of retirements from various parties. Many incumbents expressed their desire to leave politics due to burnout and a perception of diminished efficacy in the current political system <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/823083/fatigue-burn-out-disgust-why-belgian-mps-are-leaving-politics</citation>. This phenomenon underscores the broader challenges facing Belgian governance, particularly amidst coalition negotiations and the fragmented nature of the political environment, which has seen increasing polarization among the electorate.\n\nThe departure of established politicians like Verhofstadt indicates a potential shift in party dynamics, as new candidates will likely emerge to fill these positions. The landscape following this election could witness a reconfiguration of alliances and the introduction of fresh policies reflective of the changing priorities of the Belgian populace.\n\nOverall, the retirements of key incumbents during this election cycle highlight critical factors influencing Belgium's political arena, including individual burnout, shifting public sentiments, and the need for renewal in political representation.\n\n当前需要写的章节：### Senate\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

        "value": "<answer>\n### Senate\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, were significant for both the political landscape and the structure of the Senate. The Senate, comprising 60 members, includes 50 senators indirectly elected by regional and language community parliaments, along with 10 co-opted senators selected based on party performance in federal elections. The outcome of the elections resulted in a notable shift, positioning the Flemish nationalist party, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), as the largest faction in the Senate with ten senators, reflecting an increasing trend toward right-wing politics in Belgium <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>.\n\nIn the context of the broader elections, the N-VA's prominence indicates a political realignment in Flanders, where it secured approximately 24% of the vote, closely followed by the radical right party Vlaams Belang <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The rise of these right-wing parties reflects an electorate that is increasingly polarized, particularly on issues surrounding migration and regional autonomy.\n\nFrom a structural perspective, there is an ongoing discussion about the future of the Senate itself, with coalitions expressing intentions to abolish this chamber altogether. Such a move would necessitate a two-thirds majority vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, signifying the complexities involved in potential constitutional reforms <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2025/05/15/abolition-senate/</citation>.\n\nRegardless of whether the Senate persists, the results of the 2024 elections have paved the way for significant political transformations. Voter turnout was lower than usual, the lowest since compulsory voting was introduced, suggesting voter disengagement and discontent with the current political climate <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The outcomes signal a demand for change, particularly in coalition structures, as the incumbent government's majority faces challenges from these rising parties. Future discussions and legislative actions will likely focus on the viability of the Senate and the impact of these political shifts on Belgium's federal governance <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n</answer>"

The elections will not only determine the composition of the federal government but will also impact local governance and Belgium's role within the European Union.\n\nVoter turnout is expected to be a critical issue, as early polls suggest one of the lowest participation rates in history for a compulsory voting country. This marks a departure from the norm since compulsory voting was introduced in Belgium over a century ago. The implications of such low engagement could reverberate throughout the nation's political future, risking the validity of the newly formed government.\n\nWith approximately 6,550 candidates set to contest for various positions, including those in the federal parliament, regional assemblies, and the European Parliament, the election will provide a diverse slate for Belgian citizens to choose from. The political discourse leading up to the elections has been heavily influenced by pressing issues such as immigration, economic reform, and national identity, largely driven by polarizing parties, notably the far-right Vlaams Belang and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) in Flanders.\n\nThe results of the elections will be crucial not just for immediate governance but for the formation of coalitions, which have historically been complex and lengthy in Belgium. The electorate will be keenly watching to see how the balance of power shifts and what this means for the country's socio-economic policies and its strategic direction within the EU. As voters head to the polls, the outcomes will undoubtedly shape the narrative of Belgian politics for years to come.\n\nOverall, the 2024 Belgian federal elections serve as a significant barometer of public sentiment, showcasing the challenges and opportunities facing contemporary Belgium amid a rapidly changing political climate and the broader socio-economic context.<citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation><citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation><citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-whats-at-stake-for-the-belgian-people</citation>\n## Retiring Incumbents\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections saw notable shifts in the political landscape, highlighted by significant retirements among incumbents. One key figure stepping back from active politics is Guy Verhofstadt, a prominent member of the Open VLD party and a former Prime Minister of Belgium. Verhofstadt, who has served in various capacities since his election to the Belgian Parliament in 1985, has announced that he will not seek re-election in 2024, marking the end of an era for one of Belgium’s most recognizable political figures <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/494091/former-belgian-pm-guy-verhofstadt-to-retire-from-politics-in-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the 2024 elections were characterized by a growing trend of political fatigue and disillusionment among Belgian politicians, contributing to a wave of retirements from various parties. Many incumbents expressed their desire to leave politics due to burnout and a perception of diminished efficacy in the current political system <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/823083/fatigue-burn-out-disgust-why-belgian-mps-are-leaving-politics</citation>. This phenomenon underscores the broader challenges facing Belgian governance, particularly amidst coalition negotiations and the fragmented nature of the political environment, which has seen increasing polarization among the electorate.\n\nThe departure of established politicians like Verhofstadt indicates a potential shift in party dynamics, as new candidates will likely emerge to fill these positions. The landscape following this election could witness a reconfiguration of alliances and the introduction of fresh policies reflective of the changing priorities of the Belgian populace.\n\nOverall, the retirements of key incumbents during this election cycle highlight critical factors influencing Belgium's political arena, including individual burnout, shifting public sentiments, and the need for renewal in political representation.\n### Senate\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, were significant for both the political landscape and the structure of the Senate. The Senate, comprising 60 members, includes 50 senators indirectly elected by regional and language community parliaments, along with 10 co-opted senators selected based on party performance in federal elections. The outcome of the elections resulted in a notable shift, positioning the Flemish nationalist party, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), as the largest faction in the Senate with ten senators, reflecting an increasing trend toward right-wing politics in Belgium <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>.\n\nIn the context of the broader elections, the N-VA's prominence indicates a political realignment in Flanders, where it secured approximately 24% of the vote, closely followed by the radical right party Vlaams Belang <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The rise of these right-wing parties reflects an electorate that is increasingly polarized, particularly on issues surrounding migration and regional autonomy.\n\nFrom a structural perspective, there is an ongoing discussion about the future of the Senate itself, with coalitions expressing intentions to abolish this chamber altogether. Such a move would necessitate a two-thirds majority vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, signifying the complexities involved in potential constitutional reforms <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2025/05/15/abolition-senate/</citation>.\n\nRegardless of whether the Senate persists, the results of the 2024 elections have paved the way for significant political transformations. Voter turnout was lower than usual, the lowest since compulsory voting was introduced, suggesting voter disengagement and discontent with the current political climate <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The outcomes signal a demand for change, particularly in coalition structures, as the incumbent government's majority faces challenges from these rising parties. Future discussions and legislative actions will likely focus on the viability of the Senate and the impact of these political shifts on Belgium's federal governance <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Electoral system\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

        "value": "<answer>\n## Electoral System\n\nThe electoral system in Belgium is characterized by a proportional representation model, specifically using a party-list system. This system allows voters to cast their votes for political parties rather than individual candidates, which subsequently allocates seats in the Chamber of Representatives based on the percentage of votes each party receives in a given electoral district. Each district is assigned a number of seats correlating to its population size, thereby ensuring that representation reflects the demographic distribution across the country <citation>https://electiopedia.com/elections-in-belgium/</citation>.\n\nBelgium’s system underwent significant changes after the sixth state reform in December 2011, which granted more powers to regional governments and led to a more complex electoral landscape <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>. Federal elections occur every five years, synchronizing with European and regional elections to streamline the voting process for citizens <citation>https://www.populationencyclopedia.com/belgium-elections/overview/</citation>.\n\nOne notable feature of the Belgian electoral system is the requirement for compulsory voting, which mandates that all eligible citizens aged 18 and over participate in elections, a measure that aims to enhance voter turnout <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>. In recent developments, legislation has also been introduced allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in European elections, marking a progressive step in youth participation in the democratic process <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>.\n\nThe ballots used in these elections include a list of candidates from the respective parties, with voters able to select candidates from their chosen parties. This system not only enhances voter choice but also reinforces party accountability as parties strive to appeal to their constituents to secure votes at the next election <citation>https://www.reuters.com/article/world/factbox-key-facts-about-belgiums-electoral-system-idUSL10246183</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the electoral system of Belgium is designed to promote proportionality and voter engagement while ensuring that various socio-political voices are represented in the federal government. The combination of a party-list system, compulsory voting, and recent reforms targeting youth voters signifies Belgium's commitment to a robust democratic process <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BE/BE-LC01/elections/electoral-system</citation>.\n</answer>"

        "value": "任务：写一个报告讨论一下2024_Belgian_federal_election事件，要求简单清晰即可\n\n前面已写的内容：#### French-speaking constituencies\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, were marked by significant political shifts within the French-speaking constituencies, specifically in Wallonia and Brussels. In these regions, the main political players include the Mouvement Réformateur (MR), the Socialist Party (PS), and Écolo, alongside emerging parties such as the Belgian Workers' Party (PTB).\n\nIn Wallonia, the MR experienced a notable surge in support, becoming the largest French-speaking party for the first time in many years, capturing approximately 26% of the vote. This was a substantial increase from their 2019 performance, which only garnered around 16.9% of the votes. The PS, historically a dominant force in French-speaking politics, suffered a decline, securing only about 8.05% of votes and losing several seats, which underscored a shift in the political landscape toward more liberal governance within the French-speaking community <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/1085399/the-belgian-elections-biggest-winners-and-losers</citation>.\n\nIn Brussels, the voting dynamics reflected a similar pattern with MR leading the French-speaking candidates, followed closely by the PTB and the PS. The latter faced setbacks, indicating a change in voter preferences and priorities that were heavily influenced by issues such as migration and civil rights, which have gained prominence in recent electoral debates <citation>https://whogoverns.eu/belgiums-2024-elections-a-shift-to-the-right-though-less-extreme-than-expected</citation>.\n\nThe significant outcomes in the French-speaking constituencies pointed to an overall political realignment in Belgium, where voters showed a tendency towards more centrist and liberal parties amid a backdrop of growing right-wing sentiments throughout the country. This shift may have substantial implications for the formation of the next government, as coalition-building will be essential in navigating the divided political landscape brought forth by this election cycle <citation>https://publyon.com/belgian-elections-2024-results-and-potential-coalitions/</citation>.\n\nAs parties continue to navigate the results, it remains to be seen how these shifts will influence not just local governance but also federal coalitions and policies moving forward into the post-election period.\n## Opinion polls\n\nAs the 2024 Belgian federal election approaches, opinion polls are becoming increasingly significant in gauging potential voting patterns and political preferences among the electorate. Various polling organizations have conducted surveys to assess the public's voting intentions, with results indicating a competitive political landscape.\n\nAccording to the latest Ipsos poll conducted between November 18 and 21, 2024, the following voting intentions emerged: the liberal party Mouvement Réformateur (MR) leads with 27.4%, followed by the Socialist Party (PS) at 24.6%, the Environmentalist party Ecolo at 8.1%, and the Leftist party PVDA/PTB at 12.9% <citation>https://politpro.eu/en/belgium/polls/61534/ipsos/2024-11-21</citation>. This data reflects the diverse political affiliations within Belgium, where voters are influenced by both regional and ideological divides.\n\nAnalysis of the polling data indicates that Flemish parties, particularly the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), have historically fared well in previous elections. The N-VA continues to play a pivotal role in Flemish politics, appealing to a significant portion of the electorate. However, the radical right party Vlaams Belang also maintains a considerable support base, presenting a challenge to traditional parties in Flanders.\n\nIn contrast, the political landscape in Wallonia is dominated by different dynamics, primarily shaped by the PS and MR. Recent polls show that these parties are vying for votes as they attempt to expand their influence across Belgium. The diversity of party support underscores the complexity of Belgian politics, where coalition-building remains a crucial aspect of governance <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/observatoire/6212</citation>.\n\nOverall, as the election date approaches on June 9, 2024, the opinion polls highlight not only the shifting preferences among the electorate but also the potential for unexpected outcomes, as historical voting patterns may not entirely predict future results. Close observation of these trends will be essential to understanding the implications for Belgium's governance in the coming years.\n## Background\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are scheduled to take place on June 9, marking a pivotal moment in Belgium's political landscape. This election will be the first federal vote post-pandemic, a period characterized by increased political polarization and shifting voter sentiments. Historical context reveals that these elections could see one of the lowest turnouts since the introduction of compulsory voting in 1893, reflecting lingering public discontent and disengagement with the political process <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>.\n\nThis election is notable for the significant shift towards right-leaning politics, highlighted by the rise of populist and far-right parties such as Vlaams Belang (VB) and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA). Polls indicate that these parties are likely to dominate the Flemish vote, echoing a broader trend observed across Europe during this electoral cycle, where far-right parties have increasingly garnered support <citation>https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/monitor/6160</citation>. Such trends signal potential changes in governance, as parties may need to engage in complex coalition-building to secure majorities amid a fragmented political environment.\n\nThe federal elections will not only influence national policy but also affect Belgium's intricate system of federalism, where regional and linguistic divisions often complicate governance. The results will dictate the formation of various coalitions, both at the federal level and within the regions, leading to potential shifts in Belgium's political direction and the fate of ongoing crises such as migration, economic recovery post-COVID, and integration within the European Union <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation>.\n\nUnderstanding the landscape ahead of the elections requires an examination of the motivations of the electorate, the manifestos of competing parties, and the possible implications of electoral outcomes. As voter preferences evolve, the significance of these elections cannot be understated, making them a key focus for both national and international observers alike <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1008707/making-sense-of-the-belgian-elections</citation>.\n## Preface\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections are set to take place on June 9, marking a pivotal moment in the country's political landscape as it navigates the post-pandemic recovery. This election, characterized by a significant rise in populism, notably from right-leaning parties, reflects a broader trend observed across Europe. The elections will not only determine the composition of the federal government but will also impact local governance and Belgium's role within the European Union.\n\nVoter turnout is expected to be a critical issue, as early polls suggest one of the lowest participation rates in history for a compulsory voting country. This marks a departure from the norm since compulsory voting was introduced in Belgium over a century ago. The implications of such low engagement could reverberate throughout the nation's political future, risking the validity of the newly formed government.\n\nWith approximately 6,550 candidates set to contest for various positions, including those in the federal parliament, regional assemblies, and the European Parliament, the election will provide a diverse slate for Belgian citizens to choose from. The political discourse leading up to the elections has been heavily influenced by pressing issues such as immigration, economic reform, and national identity, largely driven by polarizing parties, notably the far-right Vlaams Belang and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) in Flanders.\n\nThe results of the elections will be crucial not just for immediate governance but for the formation of coalitions, which have historically been complex and lengthy in Belgium. The electorate will be keenly watching to see how the balance of power shifts and what this means for the country's socio-economic policies and its strategic direction within the EU. As voters head to the polls, the outcomes will undoubtedly shape the narrative of Belgian politics for years to come.\n\nOverall, the 2024 Belgian federal elections serve as a significant barometer of public sentiment, showcasing the challenges and opportunities facing contemporary Belgium amid a rapidly changing political climate and the broader socio-economic context.<citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-paul-magnette-belgium-election-politics-nva-socialist-party/</citation><citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation><citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/elections-2024-whats-at-stake-for-the-belgian-people</citation>\n## Retiring Incumbents\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections saw notable shifts in the political landscape, highlighted by significant retirements among incumbents. One key figure stepping back from active politics is Guy Verhofstadt, a prominent member of the Open VLD party and a former Prime Minister of Belgium. Verhofstadt, who has served in various capacities since his election to the Belgian Parliament in 1985, has announced that he will not seek re-election in 2024, marking the end of an era for one of Belgium’s most recognizable political figures <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/494091/former-belgian-pm-guy-verhofstadt-to-retire-from-politics-in-2024</citation>.\n\nAdditionally, the 2024 elections were characterized by a growing trend of political fatigue and disillusionment among Belgian politicians, contributing to a wave of retirements from various parties. Many incumbents expressed their desire to leave politics due to burnout and a perception of diminished efficacy in the current political system <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/823083/fatigue-burn-out-disgust-why-belgian-mps-are-leaving-politics</citation>. This phenomenon underscores the broader challenges facing Belgian governance, particularly amidst coalition negotiations and the fragmented nature of the political environment, which has seen increasing polarization among the electorate.\n\nThe departure of established politicians like Verhofstadt indicates a potential shift in party dynamics, as new candidates will likely emerge to fill these positions. The landscape following this election could witness a reconfiguration of alliances and the introduction of fresh policies reflective of the changing priorities of the Belgian populace.\n\nOverall, the retirements of key incumbents during this election cycle highlight critical factors influencing Belgium's political arena, including individual burnout, shifting public sentiments, and the need for renewal in political representation.\n### Senate\n\nThe 2024 Belgian federal elections, held on June 9, were significant for both the political landscape and the structure of the Senate. The Senate, comprising 60 members, includes 50 senators indirectly elected by regional and language community parliaments, along with 10 co-opted senators selected based on party performance in federal elections. The outcome of the elections resulted in a notable shift, positioning the Flemish nationalist party, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), as the largest faction in the Senate with ten senators, reflecting an increasing trend toward right-wing politics in Belgium <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/06/12/flemish-nationalists-largest-party-in-belgian-senate/</citation>.\n\nIn the context of the broader elections, the N-VA's prominence indicates a political realignment in Flanders, where it secured approximately 24% of the vote, closely followed by the radical right party Vlaams Belang <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The rise of these right-wing parties reflects an electorate that is increasingly polarized, particularly on issues surrounding migration and regional autonomy.\n\nFrom a structural perspective, there is an ongoing discussion about the future of the Senate itself, with coalitions expressing intentions to abolish this chamber altogether. Such a move would necessitate a two-thirds majority vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, signifying the complexities involved in potential constitutional reforms <citation>https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2025/05/15/abolition-senate/</citation>.\n\nRegardless of whether the Senate persists, the results of the 2024 elections have paved the way for significant political transformations. Voter turnout was lower than usual, the lowest since compulsory voting was introduced, suggesting voter disengagement and discontent with the current political climate <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2025.2492986</citation>. The outcomes signal a demand for change, particularly in coalition structures, as the incumbent government's majority faces challenges from these rising parties. Future discussions and legislative actions will likely focus on the viability of the Senate and the impact of these political shifts on Belgium's federal governance <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-alexander-de-croo-georges-louis-bouchez-tom-van-grieken-belgium-election/</citation>.\n## Electoral System\n\nThe electoral system in Belgium is characterized by a proportional representation model, specifically using a party-list system. This system allows voters to cast their votes for political parties rather than individual candidates, which subsequently allocates seats in the Chamber of Representatives based on the percentage of votes each party receives in a given electoral district. Each district is assigned a number of seats correlating to its population size, thereby ensuring that representation reflects the demographic distribution across the country <citation>https://electiopedia.com/elections-in-belgium/</citation>.\n\nBelgium’s system underwent significant changes after the sixth state reform in December 2011, which granted more powers to regional governments and led to a more complex electoral landscape <citation>https://www.expatica.com/be/living/gov-law-admin/belgium-government-106909/</citation>. Federal elections occur every five years, synchronizing with European and regional elections to streamline the voting process for citizens <citation>https://www.populationencyclopedia.com/belgium-elections/overview/</citation>.\n\nOne notable feature of the Belgian electoral system is the requirement for compulsory voting, which mandates that all eligible citizens aged 18 and over participate in elections, a measure that aims to enhance voter turnout <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>. In recent developments, legislation has also been introduced allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in European elections, marking a progressive step in youth participation in the democratic process <citation>https://www.belganewsagency.eu/a-guide-to-the-elections-the-voting-process-in-belgium</citation>.\n\nThe ballots used in these elections include a list of candidates from the respective parties, with voters able to select candidates from their chosen parties. This system not only enhances voter choice but also reinforces party accountability as parties strive to appeal to their constituents to secure votes at the next election <citation>https://www.reuters.com/article/world/factbox-key-facts-about-belgiums-electoral-system-idUSL10246183</citation>.\n\nIn summary, the electoral system of Belgium is designed to promote proportionality and voter engagement while ensuring that various socio-political voices are represented in the federal government. The combination of a party-list system, compulsory voting, and recent reforms targeting youth voters signifies Belgium's commitment to a robust democratic process <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BE/BE-LC01/elections/electoral-system</citation>.\n\n当前需要写的章节：## Aftermath\n\n请使用工具搜索相关信息，然后生成这个章节的内容。"

The elections resulted in a notable shift to the right, reflecting a growing dissatisfaction among voters with the traditional political parties. The New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) emerged as the largest party, reinforcing its position in the Belgian Parliament, while the far-right Vlaams Belang (VB) also saw substantial electoral gains, leading to speculation about potential coalitions and shifts in governance <citation>https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-far-right-election-extremist-landslide-elections-in-europe-results-2024/</citation>.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, King Philippe began consultations with party leaders to form a new government. Political analysts noted that possible coalitions could either revive the previous “Vivaldi” coalition or lean towards a center-right alliance, especially among liberal and nationalist parties. The election outcomes suggested a fragmentation of the political scene, with parties like the Francophone reformist Movement (MR) and the Socialists (PS) experiencing variable fortunes <citation>https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgian-elections-2024/1087277/election-aftermath-kingmakers-deal-breakers-and-will-flanders-break-with-belgium</citation>.\n\nThe low turnout of 87.4%, the lowest since compulsory voting was introduced, raised concerns about voter engagement and the implications of this trend on future elections. Many observers expressed shock and discontent at the election results, interpreting them as a cautionary signal regarding the growing extremism in Belgian politics, particularly in the traditionally left-leaning regions like Wallonia <citation>https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/16/in-belgium-stupefaction-after-federal-parliamentary-elections_6674912_4.html</citation>.\n\nDespite the rightward drift, some analysts argued that the expected extreme shift did not materialize as anticipated. While the results indicated a preference for more conservative governance, the far-right did not dominate as heavily as polls had predicted. This cautious outcome could be seen as a potential buffer against radical political changes, yet it underscores the rising tensions within Belgian society regarding issues such as immigration and regional autonomy <citation>https://www.newlinesmag.com/argument/how-belgium-elected-a-far-right-government/</citation>.\n\nWith a new political order set to emerge, the upcoming coalition negotiations will be pivotal. The dynamics within these discussions will likely determine Belgium's approach to key domestic issues and its stance within the European Union as it navigates the complexities of governance in a multi-party system <citation>https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/at-last-a-government-new-belgian-coalition-ponders-reforms/</citation>.\n</answer>"

    "system": "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question. \\\nYou can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.\n\n## Tool Use Formatting\n\nTool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_use>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <arguments>{json_arguments}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe tool name should be the exact name of the tool you are using, and the arguments should be a JSON object containing the parameters required by that tool. For example:\n<tool_use>\n  <name>search</name>\n  <arguments>{\"query\": [\"Population Shanghai\", \"Weather in Beijing\", \"GDP of China\"]}</arguments>\n</tool_use>\n\nThe user will respond with the result of the tool use, which should be formatted as follows:\n\n<tool_use_result>\n  <name>{tool_name}</name>\n  <result>{result}</result>\n</tool_use_result>\n\nYou shall use this result as input for the next action.\n\nAlways adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n## Tool Use Available Tools\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"search\", \"description\": \"Performs a search using the provided query.\\nSupports various search techniques using special syntax.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of search queries.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"query\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"scrape\", \"description\": \"Scrapes content using the provided URLs.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"urls\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"description\": \"A list of URLs to scrape content from.\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"urls\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Execute safe mathematical expressions.\\n\\nSupports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **) and common mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc.).\\nFor security reasons, only mathematical expressions are allowed, no arbitrary code execution.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Mathematical expression to calculate, e.g., \\\"2 + 3 * 4\\\", \\\"sin(30 * pi / 180)\\\", \\\"sqrt(16)\\\"\"}}, \"required\": [\"expression\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"taking_notes\", \"description\": \"Store notes for the current session.\\n\\nThis function expects a JSON-formatted string representing a list of note entries,\\neach in the following format:\\n\\n    [\\n        \\\"<note>First note content with <citation>original URL</citation> where data was used.</note>\\\",\\n        \\\"<note>Second note content with <citation>another URL</citation> example.</note>\\\"\\n    ]\\n\\nThe notes will be parsed, validated, and each entry saved under the current session.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"note\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"A JSON string representing a list of <note>...</note> entries.\"}}, \"required\": [\"note\"], \"additionalProperties\": false}}}, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"retrieve_notes\", \"description\": \"Retrieve all notes for the current session.\\n\\n    Returns a single string concatenating all stored notes for this session,\\n    each separated by a newline.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n2. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\n3. If no tool call is needed, just answer the question directly.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. For tool use, MAKE SURE use XML tag format as shown in the examples above. Do not use any other format.\n6. If you want to call a tool again to get more results or call other tools after receiving the tool call results returned by the user, you can still use tool calls as a response.\n7. Once you have obtained sufficient information from tool calls and decide to provide the formal answer, wrap your formal response inside <answer> tags. Wherever you use data from search results or your notes, include a <citation> tag with the original URL or source inside your answer. For example:\n<answer>\nHere is your polished response text, including a reference where needed <citation>http://example.com/source</citation>.\n</answer>\n\nNow Begin! Please use the same language as the user's question for reasoning and answering, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. \n",
