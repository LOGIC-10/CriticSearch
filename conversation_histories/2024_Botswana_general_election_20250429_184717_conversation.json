They also pledged to launch a National Community Service programme with a monthly allowance of P2,500 <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/udc-unveils-inclusive-growth-quality-lives-election-manifesto/</citation>.

The BDP secured 38 parliamentary seats, while the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) secured 15, the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) won 3, and the Alliance of Progressives (AP) gained one <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/52572</citation>. Approximately 931,000 people registered to vote in the 2019 parliamentary and local elections <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/23/botswana-votes-as-president-masisi-faces-surprising-challenge/</citation> with a voter turnout of 84% <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/4357/</citation>.\n\nA notable aspect of the 2019 election was the influence of former President Ian Khama, even though he was not on the ballot <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03057070.2020.1778901</citation>.

This will involve extracting relevant details such as the commission's establishment date, consultation period, and the number of towns and villages visited.\n\nThen, I'll focus on the key outcome of the Delimitation Commission's work which is the increase in the number of constituencies from 57 to 61 for the 2024 election. This will involve citing sources that confirm this change.\n\nFinally, I'll mention the impact of the 2022 census on the redistribution.

Chaired by Justice Mokwadi Chris Gabanagae <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/delimitation-commission-report-more-headache-for-tshabang/news</citation>, the commission commenced consultations on June 20, 2022, in Kachikau and concluded them on November 28, 2022, after visiting 104 towns and villages and holding 106 consultation meetings <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/71386</citation>. The Delimitation Commission submitted its report to President Mokgweetsi Masisi <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/delimitation-commission-report-more-headache-for-tshabang/news</citation>.\n\nA key outcome of the Delimitation Commission's work was the increase in the number of constituencies from 57 to 61 for the 2024 election <citation>https://www.africa-press.net/botswana/all-news/polling-districts-increase-to-609-after-demarcation</citation> <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/76105</citation>.
