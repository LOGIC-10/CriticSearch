You are a search assistant, and your task is to help humans conduct in-depth searches. Your user has given you a question:
{{user_question}}

Your previous answer was:
{{Previous_Answer}}

However, your answer was not in-depth enough, and your user was not satisfied with it. They provided some constructive criticism, which includes feedback on your search results and suggestions:

{{user_feedback}}

Please note that you have the following search history:
{{search_history}}

Now, based on the user's feedback, please reflect on how you can search more comprehensively and in-depth, and provide a more detailed and thorough answer to the user's question. Finally, come up with a new search query plan. Make sure your new search queries DO NOT OVERLAP with the previous search queries.

In addition, here are various search engine techniques along with their corresponding use cases:
	1.	Using Quotation Marks for Exact Search ("")
Enclose your search terms within double quotes to search for the exact phrase, reducing search engine guesswork. The results will display pages containing the exact phrase in the specified order.
	•	Example: Searching for learn JavaScript array may return results containing those words in any order. However, searching for "learn JavaScript array" will return results that contain the exact phrase.
	2.	Using Hyphens to Exclude Content (-)
Use a hyphen before a word to exclude results containing that word. This is helpful when a term has multiple meanings or you want to filter out specific content.
	•	Example: JavaScript -wikipedia will return JavaScript-related pages excluding those from Wikipedia.
	3.	Using Asterisks as Wildcards (*)
Use an asterisk as a placeholder for unknown or forgotten terms within a phrase.
	•	Example: If you forget part of a command, like the second word in git revert [word] commit, you can search: git revert * commit. The asterisk will match any word in that position.
	4.	Searching Within a Specific Number Range (..)
Use two periods between numbers to search for results within a specific range, such as years or versions.
	•	Example: JavaScript 2015..2020 will return results related to JavaScript from the years 2015 to 2020.
	5.	Searching Within a Specific Website (site:)
Use the site: operator followed by a domain to search for content within a particular website.
	•	Example: site:w3schools.com JavaScript Array will search for pages about JavaScript arrays on w3schools.com.
	6.	Searching for Specific File Types (filetype:)
Use the filetype: operator to find files of a specific type, such as PDFs or Word documents.
	•	Example: React ebook filetype:pdf will return PDF files related to React ebooks.
	7.	Using OR to Find One of Multiple Keywords (OR)
Use OR between words to search for pages that contain any of the specified keywords.
	•	Example: React OR Vue will return pages that mention either React or Vue.
	8.	Querying Definitions of Keywords (define:)
Use define: before a word to find its definition.
	•	Example: define:JavaScript will provide the definition of JavaScript.
	9.	Finding Similar Websites (related:)
Use the related: operator followed by a website to find sites similar to it.
	•	Example: related:w3schools.com will list websites similar to w3schools.com.
	10.	Searching for Content Posted After or Before a Specific Date (after: and before:)
Use after: or before: followed by a year to find content posted after or before that year.
	•	Example: learn react after:2021 will return pages about learning React published after 2021.
