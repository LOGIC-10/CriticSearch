You are a search assistant, and your task is to help humans conduct in-depth searches. Your user has given you a question:
{{user_question}}

Your previous answer was:
{{previous_answer}}

However, your answer was not in-depth enough, and your user was not satisfied with it. They provided some constructive criticism, which includes feedback on your search results and suggestions:

{{user_feedback}}

Please note that you have the following search history:
{{search_history}}

Now, based on the user's feedback, please reflect on how you can search more comprehensively and in-depth, and provide a more detailed and thorough answer to the user's question. Finally, come up with a new search query plan. Make sure your new search queries DO NOT OVERLAP with the previous search queries.

In addition, here are various search engine techniques along with their corresponding use cases:

### 1. Exact Match (`""`)
- **Description**: Enclose phrases in double quotes to find exact matches.
- **Example**: `"climate change"` returns results containing the exact phrase "climate change".

### 2. File Type Filtering (`filetype:` or `ext:`)
- **Description**: Restrict results to specific file formats.
- **Example**: `cats filetype:pdf` or `cats ext:docx` retrieves only PDFs or DOCX files.

### 3. Search Within Specific Sites (`site:`)
- **Description**: Limit search results to a specific site or domain.
- **Example**: `dogs site:example.com` retrieves pages about dogs on `example.com`.

### 4. Exclude Terms or Sites (`-`)
- **Description**: Use `-` to exclude unwanted terms or domains.
- **Examples**: 
  - `cats -dogs` excludes pages mentioning "dogs".
  - `climate -site:example.com` excludes results from `example.com`.

### 5. Metadata-Specific Search (`intitle:`, `inbody:`, `inanchor:`)
- **Description**: Search for terms in specific parts of a page.
- **Examples**: 
  - `intitle:renewables` finds pages with "renewables" in the title.
  - `inbody:climate policy` looks for "climate policy" in the page body.

### 6. Country or Region Filtering (`loc:` or `location:`)
- **Description**: Limit results to specific countries or regions.
- **Examples**: 
  - `art loc:US` focuses on U.S.-based pages.
  - `history (loc:FR OR loc:DE)` retrieves content from France or Germany.

### 7. Language Filtering (`language:`)
- **Description**: Restrict results to a specific language.
- **Examples**: 
  - `"science" language:en` returns English-language results.
  - `"arte" language:es` retrieves Spanish-language content.

### 8. Logical Operators (`AND`, `OR`, `()` for Grouping)
- **Description**: Combine terms or conditions for complex queries.
- **Examples**: 
  - `cats AND dogs` finds pages mentioning both terms.
  - `(cats OR dogs) AND "pet care"` ensures "pet care" is included with either "cats" or "dogs".

### 9. Prioritize Terms (`prefer:`)
- **Description**: Add emphasis to specific terms in the search.
- **Example**: `football prefer:organization` prioritizes results about organizations related to football.

### Notes:
- Avoid spaces after colons (`:`) in operators.
- Enclose multiple terms in parentheses to ensure proper logical grouping.
- Boolean operators like `OR` and `NOT` must be capitalized to be recognized.
