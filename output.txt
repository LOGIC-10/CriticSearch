Every major university is engaged in quantum computing research on some level. Many are deeply engaged in quantum computing research — and many have been for the past few decades.This list is an attempt to spotlight 20 top universities for quantum computing research. Although this is not even close to an exhaustive list and any sort of list that ranks quantum computing research is subject to a multitude of variables, care has been taken to move these rankings beyond just top-of-mind recognition and focus on research output. This list also attempts to consider the centrality and density of quantum computing research in universities by creating a “students-per-paper” research that hopefully allows smaller schools to be included rather than serve as a list based sheerly on the number of research papers.All of these universities offer considerable programs for other aspects of the quantum technology field, including quantum sensing, quantum communication and quantum cryptography, although studies in those fields may not necessarily have affected ordering.While research output is one way to gauge a university’s commitment to quantum computing research, it is not the only. Quantum computing education, obviously, is a primary objective of these research institutions. Where possible, we include links to some of the quantum-focused educational departments, colleges and initiatives, along with real-world impact of these quantum leaders.Here’s the list of 20 top universities for quantum computing research.20 Top Universities For Quantum Computing ResearchCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech)Student Population: 2,233 (estimated, throughout)Number of Papers: 850 (estimated, throughout)Ratio: 2.63Caltech is a prominent leader in quantum research, primarily through itsInstitute for Quantum Information and Matter (IQIM).

By John LevyCEO, Co-Founder and Chair,SEEQCIn 2023, the quantum ecosystem experienced significant strides in research and development, with companies bigandsmall contributing to the industry’s overarching goals.The culmination of these advances proves that collaboration and competition is the best approach to bring quantum computing to life. For a technology with as much potential to alter computing as we know it, we must collaborate within, and outside of, our industry to ensure its success.The achievements in 2023 are strong evidence of the positive trajectory of the industry, with numerous innovations from many different quantum computing companies, global expansion of the technology, and cross-sector collaborations vital to the development and implementation of quantum computing.BreakthroughsError correction, a key focus for quantum computing, is essential for scalability; the most successful quantum computers will be defined by this metric, among many others. In February, Google publishedpromising results, finding that a 17-qubit system could successfully recover from one error, and a 49-qubit system could recover from two simultaneous errors. This was a major milestone in Google’s quantum roadmap as it continues to be a key contributor to the quantum landscape. And in November,Amazon introduceda new chip for quantum computing which has suppressed errors by 100x. According to Amazon, combining passive and active error correction approaches could theoretically achieve quantum error correction six times more efficiently than standard methods.IBM Scientistsdiscovered a new error correction scheme that work with 10x fewer qubits, a discovery that has enabled IBM to clarifying its roadmap for the next decade.This year, our long established partner, Riverlane, introduced anerror correction decoder chipthat shows promise for tackling the complexity of decoding large arrays of error corrected qubits. This work however also highlights the latency and bandwidth bottlenecks associated with decoding error correction architectures at scale. Multi-stage decoder strategies like those byMicrosoft,Riverlaneand our scientific consultant,Simon Trebst, prove that pre-decoding is key to eliminating these latency and bandwidth bottlenecks while also proving that a chip-based solution integrated with qubits at the chip level is critical to unlocking these benefits. In 2024 we look forward to defining the world’s first integrated chip-based decoder architecture to prove our chips are the solution to scaling all quantum computers.Quantum computers must also be scalable and energy efficient to make a meaningful impact. In March,SEEQC debutedits first quantum reference system, SEEQC System Red. This milestone was celebrated in July with acollaboration with HQS Quantum Simulations, in which SEEQC Red successfully ran HQS’s algorithm for the first time on real hardware. Collaborations like this and others define (and prove) the commercial applications that this technology can provide.Later in the year, SEEQC introduced its first fully digital chipset for full-stack quantum computers, capable of control and multiplexing. SEEQC takes adifferent approachto scalability, using SFQ chip methodology as opposed to cryo-CMOS, the latter of which has been used to scale modern computing chips. SEEQC’s digital single flux quantum (SFQ) chips will be capable of running all core qubit controller functions of a quantum computer at the same cryogenic temperature as the qubits, a significant development for energy efficiency in quantum.As quantum chips continue to grow in power and capability, legacy chip providers are also significantly expanding the quantum ecosystem such as the debut ofIntel’sspin silicon 12-qubit chip in June. The experience, expertise and resources of these legacy companies allow for smaller companies to dynamically improve upon their findings and advance their technology alongside these industry leaders.It is impossible to discuss scalability and energy efficiency without addressing the need for larger qubit arrays which hold the potential for larger systems. Atom Computing was thefirst companyto reach 1,000 qubits in a quantum computer, followed up by IBM’s 1,000 qubit system,unveiledin December. These are grand milestones in showcasing the power that these quantum computers can hold, but there is still much to do surrounding error correction, scalability and coherence to make these systems commercially applicable.Quantum continues to go globalQuantum expanded globally this year, with some pivotal firsts in validating the technology occurring across the globe.IQM was selectedto deliver the first processing units for quantum computers to Spain. Like many governments globally, Spain is committed to being a part of the quantum landscape, and its presence strengthens Europe’s regional quantum industry.Similarly, Japan’s first gate-based quantum computer from the Riken Research Institutewent live, solidifying the APAC region’s r...

Title: Harvard researchers create first logical quantum processor — Harvard Gazette
Content:
Science & TechResearchers create first logical quantum processorA team led by quantum expert Mikhail Lukin (right) has achieved a breakthrough in quantum computing. Dolev Bluvstein, a Ph.D. student in Lukin’s lab, was first author on the paper.Jon Chase/Harvard Staff PhotographerAnne J. ManningHarvard Staff WriterDecember 8, 20235 min readKey step toward reliable, game-changing quantum computingHarvard researchers have realized a key milestone in the quest for stable, scalable quantum computing, an ultra-high-speed technology that will enable game-changing advances in a variety of fields, including medicine, science, and finance.The team, led byMikhail Lukin, the Joshua and Beth Friedman University Professor in physics and co-director of theHarvard Quantum Initiative, has created the first programmable, logical quantum processor, capable of encoding up to 48 logical qubits, and executing hundreds of logical gate operations, a vast improvement over prior efforts.Published inNature, the work was performed in collaboration withMarkus Greiner, the George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Physics; colleagues from MIT; andQuEra Computing, a Boston company founded on technology from Harvard labs.The system is the first demonstration of large-scale algorithm execution on an error-corrected quantum computer, heralding the advent of early fault-tolerant, or reliably uninterrupted, quantum computation.Lukin described the achievement as a possible inflection point akin to the early days in the field of artificial intelligence: the ideas of quantum error correction and fault tolerance, long theorized, are starting to bear fruit.“I think this is one of the moments in which it is clear that something very special is coming,” Lukin said. “Although there are still challenges ahead, we expect that this new advance will greatly accelerate the progress toward large-scale, useful quantum computers.”Denise Caldwell of the National Science Foundation agrees.“This breakthrough is a tour de force of quantum engineering and design,” said Caldwell, acting assistant director of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, which supported the research through NSF’s Physics Frontiers Centers and Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes programs. “The team has not only accelerated the development of quantum information processing by using neutral atoms, but opened a new door to explorations of large-scale logical qubit devices, which could enable transformative benefits for science and society as a whole.”It’s been a long, complex path.In quantum computing, a quantum bit or “qubit” is one unit of information, just like a binary bit in classical computing. For more than two decades, physicists and engineers have shown the world that quantum computing is, in principle, possible by manipulating quantum particles — be they atoms, ions, or photons — to create physical qubits.But successfully exploiting the weirdness of quantum mechanics for computation is more complicated than simply amassing a large-enough number of qubits, which are inherently unstable and prone to collapse out of their quantum states.The real coins of the realm are so-called logical qubits: bundles of redundant, error-corrected physical qubits, which can store information for use in a quantum algorithm. Creating logical qubits as controllable units — like classical bits — has been a fundamental obstacle for the field, and it’s generally accepted that until quantum computers can run reliably on logical qubits, the technology can’t really take off.To date, the best computing systems have demonstrated one ortwo logical qubits, and one quantum gate operation — akin to just oneunit of code— between them.The Harvard team’s breakthrough builds on several years of work on a quantum computing architecture known as aneutral atom array, pioneered in Lukin’s lab. It is now being commercialized by QuEra, which recently entered into a licensing agreement with Harvard’s Office of Technology Development for a patent portfolio based on innovations developed by Lukin’s group.The key component of the system is a block of ultra-cold, suspended rubidium atoms, in which the atoms — the system’s physical qubits — can move about and be connected into pairs — or “entangled” — mid-computation.Entangled pairs of atoms form gates, which are units of computing power. Previously, the team had demonstratedlow error rates in their entangling operations, proving the reliability of their neutral atom array system.With their logical quantum processor, the researchers now demonstrate parallel, multiplexed control of an entire patch of logical qubits, using lasers. This result is more efficient and scalable than having to control individual physical qubits.“We are trying to mark a transition in the field, toward starting to test algorithms with error-corrected qubits instead of physical ones, and enabling a path toward larger devices,” said paper first author Dolev Bluvstein, a Griffin School of Arts and Sciences ...

The quantum community has a reason to celebrate some important milestones in 2023, while looking ahead with a mix of optimism and even a little concern.Here’s a collection of reflections of 2023 and predictions for 2024 contributed by some of the ecosystem’s best known experts and thought leaders, including officials from Quantinuum, Terra Quantum, IQM Computers, Keysight and D-Wave.Quantinuum, Terra Quantum And Multiverse Computing2023 observations“Quantum advantage, the elusive goal of quantum computing, has been claimed by several companies and researchers in 2023 but these claims are based on very narrow and artificial problems that have no practical relevance or value. What we really need is practical quantum advantage, which means solving problems that matter for science, industry, and society, using quantum devices that are feasible and affordable in terms of size, weight, power consumption, and cost.” –Ilyas Khan, Founder and Chief Product Officer, Quantinuum“In 2023, we saw the growth of the quantum computing ecosystem, with more players entering the field and more collaborations forming across academia, industry, and government. The U.S. Department of Energy announced $625 million in funding for five new Quantum Information Science Research Centers. These initiatives reflect the increasing interest and investment in quantum computing around the world.” –Raj Hazra, President and Chief Executive Officer, Quantinuum“In 2023, academic and business organizations worldwide actively constructed quantum communications networks, spanning from a few miles to over a hundred miles in size. Research teams in places such as Chicago, Brooklyn, N.Y., and Hefei, China, diligently worked on various components required to establish this groundbreaking communications network. In June 2023, Terra Quantum achieved a groundbreaking feat in quantum communication: a new world record for both the speed of quantum data transmission and the distance covered. Using a fiber-optic network, the team successfully sent quantum-encrypted data over an impressive 1,032 kilometers (640 miles) and surpassed the previous record of generating secure, ready-to-use quantum keys by over 10,000 times.” –Florian Neukart, Chief Product Officer, Terra QuantumPredictions for 2024“Quantum hardware may start becoming more ready for industry-wide applications, thanks to powerful error-mitigation techniques and scalability experiments. Also, artificial intelligence will get a dramatic boost thanks to quantum-inspired methods, which will bring further memory efficiency, speed and accuracy. Multiverse is a pioneer in these techniques and will continue to develop quantum applications for large language models.” –Prof. Román Orús, PhD, Cofounder and Chief Scientific Officer, Multiverse Computing“In 2024, we expect to see more adoption and integration of quantum technologies in real-world scenarios, as well as more collaboration and standardization among different stakeholders. We also anticipate more challenges and opportunities arising from the coexistence of classical and quantum systems, such as interoperability, compatibility, and security.” –Raj Hazra, President and CEO, Quantinuum“In 2024, I think we’ll see a shift away from the focus on the qubit race and a broader perspective on the ability of quantum computing to expand the capabilities of other technologies. In the next 12 months, quantum hardware companies will achieve even closer integrations between classical and quantum hardware and software to achieve the highest performance from each technology. It will also be increasingly clear that quantum computing is the gateway towards artificial general intelligence based on quantum mechanics’ non-local, non-causal, and non-deterministic nature.” –Markus Pflitsch, CEO and Founder, Terra QuantumIQM Quantum Computers“In the upcoming year, I anticipate quantum computing will continue to present a growing concern for companies. But more importantly, next year businesses must evaluate their data and determine what information is of real value, to start transitioning into post-quantum cryptography as soon as possible.” –Toni Pesonen, Head of IT and Cyber Security at IQM Quantum Computers“Looking ahead to 2024, it is unlikely that we will see significant breakthroughs in the field of quantum cybersecurity, particularly with regards to code breaking. Nevertheless, the shift towards quantum-safe encryption will require a significant investment of time and resources, and it is essential to ensure the security of sensitive data in the long term. This presents an opportunity for organisations and institutions to focus on educating themselves and adapting their encryption systems to become quantum safe. In terms of other security applications, there may be more use cases identified for fraud detection using quantum computing.“While progress in quantum cybersecurity may be slow, there are other areas where we are closer to achieving quantum advantage. One such ...
