How will the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) impact the traditional banking system and financial stability in the next five years?
You previously considered this question too complex and requiring a web search. Now, please design an appropriate search query to help you answer the user’s question.

In addition, here are various search engine techniques along with their corresponding use cases:
1. Using Quotation Marks for Exact Search ("")
Enclose your search terms within double quotes to search for the exact phrase. The results will display pages containing the exact phrase in the specified order. If no or few results are found, related results may be shown.
Example: Searching for "cats and dogs" will return results for the exact term "cats and dogs".
2. Using Tilde for Semantically Similar Terms (~"")
Use a tilde and double quotes to find results that are semantically similar to a given phrase. This includes variations in word order or synonyms.
Example: Searching for ~"cats and dogs" may return results like "cats & dogs", "dogs and cats", and "cats and dogs".
3. Using Hyphens to Exclude Content (-)
Use a hyphen before a word to exclude results containing that word. This is helpful when you want to filter out specific content.
Example: Searching for cats -dogs will return results about cats but with fewer references to dogs.
4. Using Plus to Include More Results for a Term (+)
Use a plus sign before a word to prioritize results containing that word.
Example: Searching for cats +dogs will return results with more emphasis on "dogs".
5. Searching for Specific File Types (filetype:)
Use the filetype: operator to find files of a specific type. Supported file types include pdf, doc(x), xls(x), ppt(x), and html.
Example: Searching for cats filetype:pdf will return PDFs about cats.
6. Searching Within a Specific Website (site:)
Use the site: operator followed by a domain to search for content within a particular website.
Example: Searching for dogs site:example.com will display pages about dogs from example.com.
7. Excluding a Specific Website (-site:)
Use the -site: operator to exclude a specific domain from the results.
Example: Searching for cats -site:example.com will return pages about cats but exclude those from example.com.
8. Searching for Terms in Titles (intitle:)
Use the intitle: operator to find pages where the title includes the specified word.
Example: Searching for intitle:dogs will return pages with "dogs" in the title.
9. Searching for Terms in URLs (inurl:)
Use the inurl: operator to find pages where the URL includes the specified word.
Example: Searching for inurl:cats will return pages where the URL includes the word "cats".

Please ensure you properly break down the user’s question into different levels of relevant queries to obtain more comprehensive and in-depth search results and also taking fully usage of these searching techniques to better assist your query design.

TITLE: [PDF] Why Financial Institutions Should Start Paying Attention to CBDCs
URL: https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ghosts/assets/evolution-of-money-cbdcs.pdf
CONTENT: According to PwC’s CBDC Global Index, more than 60 central banks are at different stages of research and development of CBDCs. Some countries such as the US and UK are conducting research but have not announced an intention to begin CBDC development, while others - including China and Sweden - have launched live pilot programs.3 Motivations cited by central banks for pursuing CBDCs include maintaining control over monetary policy, financial inclusion,4 traceability of transactions for anti-money laundering (AML) and tax purposes, and improved cross-border payments.5 Critics have been quick to note that CBDCs could pose data security and privacy concerns as well as reduce deposits at banks, which could reduce liquidity in the financial system.6 While it will likely take years to launch a digital dollar if the US decides to pursue its development, there are steps that financial institutions can take now to prepare themselves for potential domestic and global shifts toward CBDCs. This Regulatory brief provides our perspective on how CBDCs could impact the business models of financial institutions as well as how existing custody, blockchain, cybersecurity and other functions can be adapted to support CBDCs. 6 For more information, see the Bank Policy Institute’s Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs, Benefits and Major Implications for the U.S. Economic System (April 2021).

CONTENT: Indeed, banks play a crucial role in today’s financial system, in part due to their ability to create liquid-ity through maturity transformation—i.e., by financing long-maturity assets with short-term liabilities.8 The economies of scope—or synergies—that arise from combining lending and deposit-taking activities give banks a natural advantage in providing liquidity (Acharya and Mora, 2015), protecting firms and households against idiosyncratic and systemic liquidity shocks (Gatev and Strahan, 2006, Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein, 2002), and thereby promoting economic growth (Bencivenga and Smith, 1991, Berger and Sedunov, 2017).9 To illustrate how issuing a retail CBDC could affect banks and the broader financial system, we start with a picture of the financial system as a chain of assets and liabilities.

TITLE: Four Visions For The Future Of Digital Money - Oliver Wyman Forum
URL: https://www.oliverwymanforum.com/future-of-money/2023/may/four-visions-for-digital-money.html
CONTENT: The future of money and payments can take radically different directions depending on the forms of money that gain scale, the technology designs issuers choose and use cases they target, how incentives are incorporated, and whether the regulatory and policy environment is favorable, among other factors.
 In a pilot project with the BIS, the central banks of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates showed that digital ledger technology could execute trades between the four parties’ digital currencies in seconds and reduce costs as much as 50% by cutting out correspondent banks and streamlining liquidity management. The more integrated and universal the network – that is, the greater diversity of assets and stakeholders that a distributed network contains – the higher the likelihood that new business models could emerge and disrupt banks.
 These include the areas with the greatest long-term potential to transform finance, including the tokenization of financial assets and deposits and the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) by most of the world’s largest economies. A digitally native solution that embeds money in the same distributed framework as the assets themselves will maximize the speed and cost-effectiveness of payments, as well the connectivity to associated services such as collateral management and yield enhancement.

If the CBDC is designed to allow for central bank-issued digital wallets, financial institutions may face competition from potentially lower fees.

Title: From cryptocurrencies to CBDCs, what future for money? | TSE
Content:
The development of cryptocurrencies should be seen in the context of a war between different approaches to offering economic players the possibility of storing and growing their savings and liquidity, of settling transactions, and of serving as a unit of account in financial and commercial contracts. In fact, there is considerable demand for currencies with low transaction costs, particularly for international transactions or for micro-contributions and micro-payments. [For example, the e-yuan has a transaction cost of 0.1%, compared with the 2% that credit card companies may charge].High transaction costsAny asset has the potential to be used as a currency, but very few succeed in becoming a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. Bitcoin, in particular, is a long way from achieving this. Bitcoin's transaction costs are still high. What's more, it has not yet adopted the two-sided payment card model (which involves charging the merchant and not the buyer, or even subsidizing the latter through discounts or free miles for using the card); today bitcoin serves essentially, at least in developed countries, as a store of value/speculative tool and has few benefits for transactions, apart from illegal ones.High volatilityThe very high volatility of cryptocurrency values is another factor making their use as a unit of account for contracts unlikely. This is why some cryptocurrencies are designed as stablecoins; the most important of these stablecoins today is Tether. The idea is to match the cryptocurrency with a collateral that guarantees its value. This collateral can take several forms. It can consist of securities issued in a traditional currency (such as the dollar), for example Treasury bills, or tomorrow a central bank digital currency (CBDC). These reserves must then be in sufficient quantity to peg the cryptocurrency to the chosen currency. But, of course, this requires an attentive prudential supervisor. For, as with all financial institutions, there is a strong temptation to invest in riskier, higher-yield assets than in relatively safe but low-yield ones (which is why the monitoring of the liquidity requirements imposed on banks by Basel 3 regulations is always a tricky business). In fact, in 2021, Tether, whose dollar reserves were supposed to correspond 1 for 1 to the number of tokens, was ordered by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to pay $41 million for claiming to be 100% covered by fiat currency, when in fact only 27.6% was covered. In addition, the platform may wish to grant loans to affiliated companies, which it must be prevented from doing.The need for a regulatorThere are, of course, other possible forms of collateral: financial assets, stored commodities (durable goods), raw materials, or even... other crypto-currencies (which might be useful if the values of crypto-currencies were negatively correlated, but unfortunately they seem to be positively correlated). In any case, only a prudential regulator, such as the ones for banks, can guarantee the public that the institution doesn't get too comfortable with the rules it has laid down.Moreover the nationality of this regulator is an important issue as crypto-currencies and the corresponding investors are totally global. One of the traditional roles of the banking regulator is to protect small depositors, SMEs and other regulated institutions against the risk of bankruptcy of the bank where their savings or liquid assets are deposited: see my book with Mathias Dewatripont The Prudential Regulation of Banks (MIT Press, 1994) for a discussion of the philosophy of prudential supervision. A national regulator may in fact be torn between the desire to enhance the attractiveness of its financial center (by attracting cryptocurrency-related businesses) and that of protecting those investors located on its territory, who are only a fraction of all investors, which therefore leads it to favor the former objective.The central position of the statesAgainst this backdrop, competition for leadership in digital payments will take place among at least three groups of players: decentralized cryptocurrencies, sponsored private currencies (Libra/Diem or any other Big Tech currency) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Central banks were late to enter this market, despite the competitive advantages they enjoy: the state decides what is legal tender, and can therefore force at least an optional use of its currency. This option becomes an obligation when it comes to the payment of taxes and other state levies. Finally, the state can force banks and fintech to join the state platform, as was the case for the renminbi in China and for Pix (a digital payments platform managed by the central bank) in Brazil. States will also be able to enter into agreements to make international transfers cheap, by ensuring that they are carried out automatically at the exchange rate prevailing on a highly liquid CBDC currency market. Finally, and mirroring the point already made in the previous article in this dossier about crypto-currencies, the positive benefit of CBDCs can quickly change sign in an autocratic state. The digital aspect of CBDCs will facilitate the surveillance and repression of citizens. Any additional power given to states requires the existence of the rule of law.Who will access CBDCs?The contours of this central bank digital currency have yet to be defined. In particular, who will be able to hold CBDCs, and in what proportions? Retail depositors? Those holding wholesale deposits (uninsured deposits)? What competition will there be for bank deposits? On this last point, there seems to be an emerging consensus that banks should not be drained of their stable funds. According to China's central bank, "the new digital currency is not intended to replace deposits in bank accounts and balances held by payment apps such as Alipay and WeChat". Similarly, a 2020 report from seven major central banks and the Bank for International Settlements defines the first of its three core principles in the following terms: "Coexistence with cash and other types of currency in a flexible and innovative payment system." Be that as it may, we must once again remember the economic fundamentals.The digital revolution, by facilitating the introduction of new currencies, foreshadows intense competition between the private and public sectors and among countries to offer efficient services for savings, transactions and contract writing. While it's difficult to predict the outcome, we can bet that the few economic fundamentals discussed in this article will be at the center of developments.Not all deposits can be guaranteed and/or demandableFirst and foremost, not all deposits in financial institutions are supposed to be guaranteed (protected in the event of the institution's difficulties). The risk-free nature of retail deposits up to a certain limit (€100k in France per depositor and per institution) is currently guaranteed by the State. Ideally, this guarantee is provided by a sufficiently robust deposit guarantee fund; failing that, it comes from a bailout by the state, provided the latter is solvent. In normal times, however, deposits are covered by loans (narrow banking is suboptimal). It should also be noted that Basel's prudential supervision rules now rightly insist on a minimum amount of equity and bailinable liabilities for banks. Unfortunately, all too often, deposit guarantees apply to all depositors, whether or not the deposits are insured, as we saw again recently with the near-bankruptcy of Crédit Suisse.Secondly, not all deposits in financial institutions are supposed to be demandable. If the transformation function of banks can be schematized by the characterization that banks on average accept demand deposits and lend on a long-term basis, it is normal for banks to have a portion of their liabilities in securities that are only payable at term (and compensate investors for this concession). This partly limits the banks’ liquidity risk.What to do?Broader access to CBDCs would considerably increase the size of safe demand deposits. Is this desirable? Let's not forget that, if a significant part of the banks' liabilities were transferred to the central bank, the government would be obliged to grant loans to compensate for the lost bank loans. However, the government generally lacks the necessary expertise to grant loans; it may also show favoritism for political ends in granting these loans; and lastly, it may be too lenient with insolvent borrowers (the "soft budget constraint" phenomenon). A more conservative approach would be to limit the amount per capita that can be held in CBDCs. CBDCs would de facto be the new insured deposits of individuals, and would pay the deposit insurance premium. The advantage of CBDCs would then be greater ease of use and low transaction costs for households.Published in La Jaune & la Rouge, n° 792, February 2024,https://www.lajauneetlarouge.com/magazine/792/Illustration Photo de André François McKenzie sur UnsplashFebruary 01, 2024Cryptocurrencies: an economist's viewFebruary 05, 2024Financing the ecological transition in Sub-Saharan AfricaAuthorJean TiroleShareSame themeMay 23, 2024How can we convince farmers to use smart water meters?January 25, 2024How should we allocate capital and share risks?December 11, 2023Low-carbon transition: what impact on companies' cost of capital?

Digital CurrenciesEconomy & BusinessFinancial RegulationIssue BriefApril 10, 2024Print this pageStandards and interoperability: The future of the global financial systemByAnanya Kumar, Alisha Chhangani, Jennifer Lassiter, and Katherine HaarTable of contentsIntroductionThe call for standardsDefining standardsA comprehensive overview of current standards on digital assetsLessons learned from standard-setting effortsEstablishing standardsKey themes for a CBDC frameworkConclusionAbstractOver the past few years, the global financial landscape has undergone a significant transformation marked by the emergence and integration of digital assets. Looking ahead, the global financial terrain is set to include a spectrum of both sovereign and nonsovereign digital currencies and both centralized and decentralized networks. This future brings the promise of enhanced efficiency, inclusion, transparency, and choice to global payments. To fulfill this promise, the international community must develop interoperability standards that prioritize a fast, highly scalable, and resilient architecture. The flexibility of this architecture to adapt configurability based on policy and economic considerations is critical to its success.This working paper is a foundational step toward a broader, global dialogue about digital asset standards. The Digital Dollar Project and the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center hosted a global convening titled “Exploring Central Bank Digital Currency: Evaluating Challenges and Developing International Standards” in November 2023. A version of this paper was released as a working paper to level set the attendees of the conference and provide a call to engage the public and the private sector in standard-setting efforts. This paper was further developed based on feedback from the conference and outreach afterward. The paper now reflects what we learned from our convening and incorporates the most recent developments in standard-setting efforts globally. The rapid growth of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) worldwide underscores the importance of aligning approaches to their development, adoption, and implementation across technical, regulatory, and governance levels. Today, there is a patchwork of first steps undertaken by both public-and private-sector entities, aimed at achieving different objectives. These efforts have focused on frameworks, guiding principles, and, in some cases, the development of standards for digital assets broadly, as described below. Some are CBDC-specific and others have general applicability in the payments sector. As governments and stakeholders collaborate to establish consistent benchmarks for CBDC development, it’s crucial to identify, organize, and align standard-setting endeavors. This process involves assessing existing efforts to pinpoint gaps and create a foundation for international standards that remain open and flexible for future development and innovation. Through this paper, we show the crucial element of interoperability, which is needed for the furtherance of standards on CBDCs and digital assets. We attempt to build the pressing themes around which standards will have to be addressed through existing and new efforts.IntroductionIn recent years, the global financial landscape has witnessed a profound transformation characterized by the accelerated rise and integration of digital assets. As a subset of these assets, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have captivated the interest of countries worldwide.1Atlantic Council, “Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker,” Atlantic Council, last updated December 2023,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/.The CBDC landscape has rapidly evolved with 130 countries, representing 98 percent of the global economy, actively researching and, in some cases, deploying CBDCs. A recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) revealed that the number of central banks likely to issue a CBDC within the next three years has grown in the past year from 15 percent to 18 percent for retail CBDCs (rCBDC) and from 8 percent to 15 percent for wholesale CBDCs (wCBDC).2Bank for International Settlements (BIS),Central Bank Digital Currency: Motivations and Implications, BIS Papers no. 136, November 2020,https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.htm.CBDCs, in their promise and potential, are emblematic of a broader shift—a movement toward a more efficient, frictionless digital infrastructure, shaping the future of international trade, cross-border payments, and global financial integration. However, with transformative potential comes inherent complexity. As fiat currencies become more intertwined with technology there are significant implications for privacy, human rights, cybersecurity, digital financial inclusion, and the movement of money across borders for international trade, aid, investment, and other payments. If designed without a common framework of standards and collaboration, a shortsighted and fragmented approach to CBDC development could lead to the emergence ofwalled gardens.At the core of establishing standards lies the concept of interoperability—the ability for diverse systems to interact seamlessly and reduce friction. In this context, interoperability extends beyond technical objectives alone; it requires a broader framework including regulatory and governance standards, paving the way for streamlined cross-border transactions, reduced operational friction, and bolstered trust among participating entities. While not a panacea, technical, regulatory, and governance benchmarks are instrumental in navigating the complexities of the international payments systems. In order to achieve interoperability, CBDC exploration should prioritize a thorough discussion on establishing technical, regulatory, and governance standards. (See Annex 1 for definitions relevant to this discussion.)This paper is intended as a catalyst to stimulate a broader, global dialogue about CBDC standards. It takes stock of existing activities, begins to define how these efforts may be coordinated and aggregated into a set of globally accepted best practices, and offers a baseline for addressing gaps or deficiencies in defining best practices.The call for standardsCBDCs are a digital form of a country’s national currency, issued and backed by the country’s central bank. They come in two forms: retail CBDCs (rCBDC), accessible to individual consumers and usable for everyday purchases and peer-to-peer payments, and wholesale CBDCs (wCBDC), utilized by financial institutions or other major entities for interbank settlements and large financial transactions. The motivations behind rCBDCs and wCBDCs are distinct. The deployment of rCBDCs is usually motivated by financial inclusion, payment efficiency, privacy, and safety. Interest in wCBDCs is aimed at addressing cross-border friction to improve international payments—including limited operating hours, long transaction chains, restrictions on legacy technology platforms, data fragmentation, high costs, complex funding, and compliance issues.3Josh Lipsky and Ananya Kumar, “It’s Official: The United States Is Developing a Bank-to-Bank Digital Currency,”New Atlanticist, Atlantic Council, December 15, 2022,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/its-official-the-united-states-is-developing-a-bank-to-bank-digital-currency/.Ultimately, rCBDCs and wCBDCs would operate in conjunction with each other to achieve both the domestic and cross-border needs of a country.4BIS, “Project Icebreaker Concludes Experiment for a New Architecture for Cross-border Retail CBDCs,” March 5, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/icebreaker.htm.Therefore, the deployment of domestic CBDCs must not be considered in isolation or the result will be walled gardens that stand apart from global commerce and economic trends. Creating a CBDC in a silo is unlikely to achieve the desired outcomes in the short or long term, as it will replicate the friction of the existing payments systems. CBDCs’ potential to provide a simpler and more efficient way to move money can only be realized as long as the CBDCs can interoperate with one another.If deployed, a CBDC must be able to operate across various transactions, institutions, and users. Many CBDC initiatives and explorations recognize the complex and interconnected ecosystem in which financial activity takes place and the interdependencies of the different participants in transaction settlements. By agreeing on standards upfront—which is by no means a simple task—CBDCs can hopefully escape some of the growing pains that we have seen with the development of new financial technology (such as automated teller machines that could only be used by customers of a specific bank) or new digital technology (such as the challenges posed by the early years of closed-loop email).Concentrating on developing and implementing clear and accessible global standards can enable greater industry collaboration and competitiveness through interoperability, transferability, consistency, and safety across various industries and economies. With this clarity, countries can direct their efforts toward aligning and promoting key principles such as privacy, free enterprise, the rule of law, and economic liberty within the global financial landscape.5The Digital Dollar Project:Exploring a US CBDC, Digital Dollar Foundation and Accenture, May 2020,https://digitaldollarproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Dollar-Project-Whitepaper_vF_7_13_20.pdf.Defining standardsAt the heart of this paper is the effort to promote interoperability in payments systems and prevent the creation ofwalled gardens. We therefore define standards as the technical, regulatory, and governance benchmarks needed to achieve interoperable systems in the long run. It is crucial to recognize that standards do not emerge arbitrarily; instead, they evolve from fundamental principles, embodying intentional consideration and consensus.Standards specific to CBDCs are not unchanging; they must reflect and be responsive to technological development, market shifts, and experience. Standards are established by technical and governance bodies, often made up of diverse stakeholders, and reflect a consistent floor for pragmatic implementation across jurisdictions. Therefore, they must have built-in flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances across a variety of market structures.Our use of a narrow definition of standards as a means to achieve interoperable payments systems helps navigate the complex technical, governance, and regulatory environment. In the following section, we catalog existing standards for digital assets and the institutions responsible for setting them.A comprehensive overview of current standards on digital assetsMethodologyDue to their rapid growth, global standard-setting bodies have had to regulate and harmonize the adoption and use of digital assets across borders. In this section we provide an overview of the prominent organizations that play a pivotal role in shaping the digital asset landscape. Understanding the functions, roles, and importance of these bodies is critical for fostering a safe, competitive, and inclusive digital economy. We explore global governance institutions—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank for International Settlements—as well as regulatory standard setters—the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), and the Financial Stability Board (FSB)—and technical bodies like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Since rCBDC projects have largely been in the pilot, development, and research stage while wCBDC projects are currently limited, standard-setting efforts in some bodies have focused on broader digital asset developments.International Monetary FundAs a key institution in international monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability, the IMF is instrumental in assisting its 190 member countries in managing economic change. Its expertise in macrofinancial surveillance can help identify vulnerabilities associated with digital assets and it can offer policy advice to enhance the resilience of economies.In November 2023, the IMF released a virtual handbook on CBDCs, designed as a comprehensive guide for policymakers and experts in central banks and finance ministries. The plan for this evolving handbook is to offer about twenty chapters by 2026, with periodic updates to reflect the latest findings and viewpoints.6International Monetary Fund (IMF),Central Bank Digital Currency Virtual Handbook, last updated November 2023,https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/fintech/central-bank-digital-currency/virtual-handbook.The initial chapters address key topics like the framework for exploring CBDCs, product development, impacts on monetary policy, capital flow management, and financial inclusion.A publication called IMF Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency Capacity Development, released in April 2023, outlines the IMF’s efforts to facilitate peer learning and develop analytical underpinnings for advising member countries on CBDCs. In addition to research, the IMF provides technical assistance, including the XC platform initiative.7IMF,IMF Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency Capacity Development, Policy Paper, April 12, 2023,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2023/04/12/IMF-Approach-to-Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-Capacity-Development-532177.The XC platform, proposes a global centralized ledger to simplify and streamline cross-border payments. This initiative builds on the concept of wholesale CBDCs, but the platform includes commercial banks, payment providers, and central banks within a single, streamlined system. The XC model aims to reduce transaction costs and settlement times, making it an attractive option for countries looking to enhance their cross-border payment systems.Described as a “digital town square,” the XC platform would build a three-layer architecture: a settlement layer that acts as the primary ledger, a programming layer for executing smart contracts, and an information layer designed to protect personal data while ensuring compliance and facilitating currency controls as needed.8Tobias Adrian and Tommaso Mancini Griffoli, “The Rise of Payment and Contracting Platforms,” Fintech Notes No. 2023/005 (International Monetary Fund, June 19, 2023),https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fintech-notes/Issues/2023/06/16/The-Rise-of-Payment-and-Contracting-Platforms-534794.The platform’s architecture is designed to be open and upgradeable, ensuring its longevity and adaptability to future innovations. Instead of adopting CBDCs, central banks can issue certificates of escrow (CE) for use exclusively on the XC platform. CEs enhance financial accessibility by granting more entities, including nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), payment-system providers (PSPs), and nonresidents, direct access to central bank reserves. These certificates share characteristics with CBDCs and can later be converted into central bank reserves by financial institutions. According to the IMF, a key advantage of using CEs is that it allows countries to prioritize domestic use cases for their CBDC projects, while CEs can be used solely for cross-border transactions.9Tobias Adrian, “A Cross-Border Payments, Exchange, and Contracting Platform for the 21st Century,” International Monetary Fund, November 18, 2022,https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/11/18/sp-cross-border-payments-exchange-contracting-platform-21st-century.The XC model is designed for wide-ranging compatibility with existing systems, requiring central banks to make only minor technical updates. The model is a policy and regulatory framework; it encourages countries to adopt consistent and supportive regulations for cross-border payments, potentially incorporating tokens and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). In order for the model to work, however, it will need compatible legal and regulatory frameworks to effectively manage risks and ensure compliance across various jurisdictions. Tobias Adrian, Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the IMF, furtherexplainedthis point at ourconferencein November 2023.Bank for International SettlementsThe BIS acts as the central bank for central banks, fostering monetary and financial stability globally. It actively explores the impact of digital currencies on the financial system and central bank operations. The BIS Innovation Hub facilitates research and development on digital innovation, helping member countries adapt to the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Its membership consists of sixty-three central banks and monetary authorities.10“Member Central Banks,” BIS, n.d.,https://www.bis.org/about/member_cb.htm.Recent significant projects include Project Mariana, which tested cross-border trading using CBDCs and decentralized finance technology, and Project Icebreaker, which focused on using retail CBDCs for international payments through a novel hub-and-spoke model, both completing their testing phase in 2023.11“BIS Innovation Hub projects,” BIS, accessed November 26, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/projects.htm?m=268&#8203.Most recently, Project Sela, a collaboration between the BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre, the Bank of Israel, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, focused on exploring rCBDC features including accessibility, cyber security, and effective public-private collaboration, with an emphasis on central banks overseeing retail ledgers and private intermediaries managing customer-facing services.12Bénédicte Nolens, “Project Sela: An Accessible and Secure Retail CBDC Ecosystem,” a joint experiment by BIS and the central banks of Hong Kong SAR and Israel, September 12, 2023.In July 2023, the BIS presented the results of a survey showing that 93 percent of central banks are engaged in CBDC work, with retail CBDC development more advanced than wholesale CBDC.13Anneke Kosse and Ilaria Mattei, “Making Headway–Results of the 2022 BIS Survey on Central Bank Digital Currencies and Crypto,” BIS Papers no. 136, BIS, July 10, 2023,https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.htm.The survey reveals most central banks recognize the value of having both a retail CBDC and a fast payment system.14Kosse and Mattei, “Making Headway.”By 2030, there could be fifteen retail and nine wholesale CBDCs publicly circulating, while stablecoins and crypto assets are rarely used for payments outside the crypto ecosystem.15Kosse and Mattei, “Making Headway.”This BIS finding followed its June 2021 report discussing its survey on CBDCs, which found that many central banks had not decided on issuing a CBDC, but had a tentative inclination toward allowing cross-border use by tourists and nonresidents. In March 2021, the BIS explored the potential for multi-CBDC (mCBDC) arrangements to improve cross-border payments by leveraging interoperable central bank digital currencies. Technology could play a role in addressing inefficiencies, and the paper discusses the dimensions of payment system interoperability and the benefits of mCBDC arrangements.16“Project mBridge: Experimenting with a Multi-CBDC Platform for Cross-border Payments,” BIS, last updated October 31, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/mcbdc_bridge.htm.The BIS Universal Ledger interoperability model advocates for a shared global ledger that integrates various forms of money—including CBDCs, tokenized deposits, and other digital financial assets—into a single, programmable environment. The BIS aims to address the inefficiencies and silos present in the financial system by enabling safer transactions and atomic settlements within a transparent framework.The architecture of the unified ledger model is designed to be secure, scalable, and interoperable, with a strong emphasis on privacy and regulatory compliance. At its core, the architecture includes a data environment for securely storing digital asset representations, like CBDCs and tokenized deposits, in organized partitions managed by authoritative entities such as central banks and commercial banks. The execution environment facilitates the automation of complex financial operations and secure, efficient transaction processing. This environment supports atomic settlement, ensuring comprehensive transaction success or complete rollback. In addition, to safeguard sensitive data and transaction privacy, the model implements cryptographic methods like homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. These technologies enable encrypted data computation without exposing the actual data, reinforcing the system’s privacy and security. An important component of the BIS project is the governance framework that establishes operational and regulatory compliance protocols, while also detailing the responsibilities of all involved parties, including central and commercial banks.Unlike the XC model, which builds on blockchain solutions, the BIS’s unified ledger approach uses application programming interfaces (APIs), creating a more centralized system where transactions have to be processed and validated by authorized entities, such as central banks or designated financial institutions.17Adrian, “Cross-Border Payments.”Within this system, central bank money can circulate on a platform that is not owned and operated by the central bank, which can present risks. It also raises questions about the security, control, and integrity of central bank money when it is managed outside the traditional central banking systems.The BIS favors a system grounded in central bank money, offering a sounder basis for innovation, stable and interoperable services across borders, and a virtuous circle of trust through network effects.18Agustín Carstens, “The Future Monetary System: From Vision to Reality,” Keynote Speech at the CBDC & Future Monetary System Seminar, Seoul, Korea, November 23, 2023, via BIS site,https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp231123.htm.Basel Committee on Banking SupervisionThe BCBS is the global body for setting prudential standards for banking supervision and regulation. With the emergence of digital assets and their potential impact on banking operations and risk management, the BCBS is studying the implications for financial institutions. The committee’s membership includes central banks and banking supervisory authorities from twenty-eight countries.19“The Basel Committee–Overview,” BIS, n.d.,https://www.bis.org/bcbs/.The BCBS standard for prudential treatment of crypto asset exposures integrates crypto assets into the Basel Framework for banks.20Note a prior section on crypto asset exposures was removed in mid-December 2023. A new section will be effective in 2025 and is is available for viewing.https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/chapter/SCO/60.htm?inforce=20250101&published=20221216.Joint reports by CPMI, BIS, the IMF, and the World Bank on central bank digital currencies for cross-border payments emphasize CBDCs’ potential to enhance cross-border payments through international cooperation and coordination.Financial Action Task ForceFATF primarily focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing and has had less emphasis on specific guidelines for CBDCs. Its recommendations function as guidance on regulating virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to ensure the prevention of illicit financial activities. More than 200 jurisdictions have committed to implementing FATF standards, making the organization a key player in shaping regulatory frameworks to maintain transparency and security in the digital asset sphere.21Financial Action Task Force (FATF), FATF,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html.FATF has thirty-eight member countries, including major economies and financial centers worldwide.22That number includes the Russian Federation, whose membership has been suspended. See “FATF Member Countries,” FATF website,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html.FATF has published several papers related to virtual assets and VASPs. The first version of its Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and VASPs, released in June 2019, focused on risk assessment and monitoring, particularly for issues of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).23FATF,Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, 2019,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets.html.A twelve-month review of the revised FATF standards on virtual assets and VASPs was conducted in July 2020, showing progress in implementing these standards among some jurisdictions, but not yet sufficient progress to create a global AML/CFT regime for virtual assets.24FATF,Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach: Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, October 2021,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html.A second twelve-month review in June 2022 revealed continued progress, but indicated that implementation was still insufficient and certain challenges remained, such as the implementation of the “travel rule.”25Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, FATF, June 2022,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html.This rule is a legal obligation that requires financial institutions—such as banks and cryptocurrency service providers—to collect and share detailed information about the parties involved in a financial transaction.To address these challenges and based on the two reviews, FATF published Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and VASPs in October 2021. This guidance includes updates in six key areas, including clarifying the definitions of virtual assets and VASPs, guidance on stablecoins, and additional guidance on peer-to-peer transactions and information-sharing among VASP supervisors.26FATF, “Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers.”However, the latest update on the implementation, published in June 2023, indicated that jurisdictions still struggle with fundamental requirements.27FATF, “Virtual Assets: Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers,” June 27, 2023,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2023.html.The report also emphasizes the need for appropriate risk identification and mitigation measures, especially for decentralized finance (or DeFi) and unhosted wallets (e.g., controlled by the owner rather than a platform or exchange manager), which have the potential for misuse. In 2020, FATF has also reported to the Group of Twenty (G20) on stablecoins, outlining its specific views on the application of anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing requirements.28FATF, “FATF Report to G20 on So-called Stablecoins,” June 2020,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Virtualassets/Report-g20-so-called-stablecoins-june-2020.html.There is ongoing work needed to ensure consistent and effective implementation of FATF standards in the digital asset sphere, and some jurisdictions are still struggling with fulfilling the fundamental requirements outlined by FATF.International Organization of Securities CommissionsAs the leading international standard-setting body for securities regulation, IOSCO plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and efficiency of capital markets. With a growing interest in digital securities, IOSCO’s principles on issuer and investor protection, market integrity, and risk mitigation have significant implications for the global adoption of tokenized assets. IOSCO has more than 120 members, including national securities regulators and exchanges from various jurisdictions.29FATF,International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism & Proliferation: The FATF Recommendations, as amended November 2023,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Fatf-recommendations.html.While debates on which digital assets count as securities are ongoing in the United States, IOSCO has been actively engaged in providing insights into the realm of digital asset markets through a series of consultation reports and public reports.Policy Recommendations for Crypto and Digital Asset Markets, published in November 2023, stands out as a comprehensive consultation report proposing eighteen recommendations that address six key areas of concern. These areas include conflicts of interest resulting from vertical integration, market manipulation, cross-border risks, custody and client asset protection, operational and technological risks, and retail access, suitability, and distribution.30International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),Policy Recommendations for Crypto and Digital Asset Markets: Final Report, November 16, 2023,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD747.pdf.In March 2020, IOSCO releasedGlobal Stablecoin Initiatives, a public report emphasizing the applicability of principles for financial market infrastructures to stablecoin arrangements with systemically important functions. IOSCO’s work on exchange traded funds and crypto-asset trading platforms may also apply to global stablecoins.31IOSCO,Global Stablecoin Initiatives: Public Report, March 2020, PDF,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD650.pdf.In March 2022, IOSCO presented its public report on decentralized finance, highlighting regulatory concerns like fraud risks, flash loans, cybersecurity, and spillover effects on traditional markets. Additionally, in December 2020, the organization publishedInvestor Education on Crypto-Assets,a report to educate the public and investors on crypto assets and risk mitigation.32IOSCO,Investor Education on Crypto-Assets: Final Report, December 2020,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD668.pdf.Committee on Payments and Market InfrastructuresUnder the BIS, the CPMI provides a platform for central banks to promote the safety and efficiency of payment systems worldwide. With digital assets gaining recognition, the CPMI is actively engaging in discussions concerning the potential role of CBDCs and their interplay with private cryptocurrencies. The CPMI has twenty-eight members, representing major central banks and monetary authorities.A 2018 Markets Committee report titledCentral Bank Digital Currenciesintroduces and defines CBDCs, assessing their potential implications for monetary policy and central bank operations.33Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI),Central Bank Digital Currencies, CPMI Markets Committee, March 12, 2018,https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.htm​.It recommends further research on various aspects including interest rates, financial stability, and exchange rates. The report also warns against the risks of private digital tokens due to their volatility and lack of protection for investors and consumers, making them unsuitable for widespread use in payments.Financial Stability BoardThe FSB’s mandate is to oversee and coordinate global financial regulation, identifying and addressing systemic risks to foster stability in the financial system. Recognizing the growing importance of digital assets, the FSB monitors developments and potential risks arising from their use and ensures that the digital asset market operates within established stability parameters.34Financial Stability Board, “Crypto-assets and Global ‘Stablecoins,’ ” n.d.,https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/financial-innovation-and-structural-change/crypto-assets-and-global-stablecoins/​​.The FSB is broadly focused on the global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities, and has not released any specific research or guidelines on CBDC development. The board’s membership includes a combination of G20 economies, other major economies, and international organizations.35Financial Stability Board, “Crypto-assets and Global ‘Stablecoins.’International Organization for StandardizationThe ISO fosters agreement on best practices and processes, and publishes standards and technical specifications (TS), including on the security aspects for digital currencies. ISO/TS 23526:2023 focuses on providing a security framework for the issuance and management of digital currencies in general, using cryptographic mechanisms standardized by ISO and other references. The document aims to integrate security aspects into the design of digital currency systems, as opposed to adding them later as an extra layer, to accommodate legacy infrastructures​.​36“ISO/TS 23526:2021,” Online Browsing Platform, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), accessed November 26, 2023,https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:ts:23526:ed-1:v1:en.ISO does not have any explicit references or guidelines on CBDCs’ technical security, but instead has a broader focus on digital currencies overall.The following organizations below were added after the conference and depict wide-ranging efforts for interoperability occurring both in the private and public sector.Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial TelecommunicationBuilding on its legacy in global financial messaging, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) has introduced a model to enhance its existing infrastructure for cross-border payments, making them faster, more transparent, and cost-effective. Currently in beta testing, this model facilitates the connection of disparate national CBDC networks, enabling them to communicate and transact with one another while leveraging Swift’s existing infrastructure and security protocols—best thought of as a hub-and-spoke arrangement between various central banks with Swift at the center. This initiative is part of a broader Swift effort to prevent the fragmentation of the global payments landscape into “digital islands.”37“Swift Advances CBDC Innovation as Interlinking Solution Begins Beta Testing,” Swift, September 13, 2023,https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-advances-cbdc-innovation-interlinking-solution-begins-beta-testing.The project began in March 2023, with over eighteen participants, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Banque de France. Within a twelve-week period, they were able to process over 5,000 transactions. In September 2023, Swift further broadened the initiative by announcing the participation of three new central banks: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Central Bank of Kazakhstan, and an additional, anonymous central bank.Following the insights and successes from Phase 1, Swift released the takeaways from the Phase II CBDC sandbox project in March 2024, engaging thirty-eight central banks, commercial banks, and market infrastructures from around the globe. This project was designed to tackle complex use cases and assess solutions within a controlled sandbox environment. The second phase involved over 125 participants, who collectively executed more than 750 transactions. The sandbox was hosted on Kaleido, a Web3 platform for blockchain applications, where central banks were able to simulate CBDC transactions. Swift’s technology stack included a combination of the Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, and Hyperledger Besu platforms.38“Swift Advances CBDC Innovation,” Swift.Phase II explored four new use cases. First, it demonstrated the automation of trade payments through CBDC networks and smart contracts, aiming to improve trade efficiency and minimize costs. Second, it evaluated two models for foreign exchange trade and settlement: an International Foreign Exchange Marketplace and a Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) inspired system, both of which underscored the integration of CBDC trade and settlement. Third, the project focused on delivery versus payment (DvP), facilitating atomic DvP for tokenized bonds by ensuring interoperability between tokenization platforms and CBDC networks. Finally, it investigated mechanisms to mitigate liquidity fragmentation across various currencies and platforms, utilizing smart contracts and netting algorithms. The report established three foundational principles for interoperability: linking networks via ISO 20022 messaging, providing a unified point of access through Swift, and ensuring coexistence with traditional market infrastructures.39“Swift Advances CBDC Innovation as Interlinking Solution Begins Beta Testing,” Swift, September 13, 2023,https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-advances-cbdc-innovation-interlinking-solution-begins-beta-testing.This model leverages Swift’s global reach and the existing network effects among financial institutions. It also offers flexibility for countries to maintain their own domestic CBDC infrastructure while ensuring global connectivity.The Internet Engineering Task ForceThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is deeply involved in the development of standards to enhance blockchain interoperability, focusing on the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP).40“Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP),” Internet Engineering Task Force, accessed April 6, 2024,https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/satp/about/.This protocol is designed to enable seamless transfers of digital assets across diverse distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) by leveraging a network of trusted gateways, akin to the role border gateway routers played in the early internet. Such an approach offers a scalable and ledger-agnostic solution for the rapidly evolving digital asset ecosystem.SATP facilitates asset transfers through a structured process that includes three main stages: Transfer Initiation, Lock-Evidence Verification, and Commitment Establishment. The protocol ensures that digital assets are exclusively valid within one network at any given time, adopting a transfer mechanism that maintains the asset’s integrity and uniqueness.41Andre Augusto, Rafael Belchior, Imre Kocsis, Laszlo Gonczy, Andre Vasconcelos, and Miguel Correia, “CBDC Bridging between Hyperledger Fabric and Permissioned EVM-based Blockchains,” paper presented at INESC-ID and Instituto Superior Tecnico, 2023,https://www.dpss.inesc-id.pt/~mpc/pubs/Augusto-CBDC-2023.pdf.This is achieved through the strategic use of gateway endpoints which manage the transfer process, ensuring secure, transparent, and auditable transactions that adhere to Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) principles.42Martin Hargreaves, Thomas Hardjono, and Rafael Belchior, “Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) Core,” draft-ietf-satp-core-04 (Internet-Draft), Internet Engineering Task Force, ,https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-satp-core/.The SATP framework comprises a comprehensive set of API endpoints and resources for the initiation and execution of asset transfers. It also aims to facilitate the integration and management of digital asset transactions, contributing to a more efficient and secure digital economy.Hyperledger, an open-source community focused on blockchain technologies, plays a role in implementing and advancing SATP through projects like Hyperledger Cacti.43“Cacti, “Hyperledger Foundation,https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/cacti.Cacti serves as a blockchain integration framework that enhances interoperability by allowing operations across multiple enterprise-grade blockchain networks. It achieves this through a pluggable architecture that supports Business Logic Plugins (BLP) and Ledger Connectors, enabling seamless interaction with various DLTs.Global Blockchain Business CouncilThe GBBC has launched the fourth iteration of the Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI 4.0), a comprehensive project designed to map and analyze the blockchain and digital assets landscape.44“Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI),” Global Blockchain Business Council,https://gbbcouncil.org/gsmi/.This initiative provides an extensive overview of regulatory developments across 230 jurisdictions and six global bodies, compiles a taxonomy of 350 terms and definitions, maps sixty-three technical standards bodies, and identifies more than 2,000 stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, it offers access to 1,500+ courses from accredited educational institutions and includes four in-depth reports focusing on AI convergence, digital identity, supply chain, and sustainability, with a special spotlight on Brazil. GSMI 4.0, building on the work since 2020, aims to present a holistic view of global industry activity. The initiative’s resources, including an interactive map of blockchain and digital asset regulations and a series of reports, are available on the GSMI site (https://gbbcouncil.org/gsmi/). All materials produced by the GSMI are crowd-sourced and open access, ensuring they serve as a reliable information source for those interested in blockchain and digital assets.The Internet Governance ForumThe Internet Governance Forum (IGF), primarily serves as a multistakeholder platform for policy dialogue on internet governance issues.45“About Us,” Internet Governance Forum, accessed March 1, 2024,https://www.intgovforum.org/en/about.While not directly implementing or proposing specific financial systems, the IGF’s contribution lies in facilitating discussions, building consensus, and sharing best practices among stakeholders to influence the governance frameworks that underpin these technologies. First convened in 2006 by the United Nations secretary-general as a result of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) held in 2003 and 2005, IGF gathers governments, the private sector, civil society, and technical communities to debate and share insights on enhancing internet security, ensuring digital privacy, fostering the digital economy, and expanding internet access.Security, trust, and privacy are central to the IGF’s discussions on digital financial services. The forum encourages dialogue on how to protect against fraud, ensure the integrity of digital transactions, and safeguard users’ privacy and data in an increasingly digital global economy. Key areas of focus for the IGF also include the development of governance frameworks that protect user data and ensure a secure online environment. The forum also emphasizes the importance of digital inclusion, advocating for equitable access to the internet and digital services across different regions and communities. Through its annual meetings and intersessional work, the IGF indirectly supports the infrastructure and policies that impact the digital economy and financial inclusivity.As the above section shows, there have been some efforts in creating standards for interoperability of digital assets. From feedback after the conference, we added the work of organizations such as Swift, IETF, GBBC, and IGF in standard creation. All the organizations listed above have led to important standard making efforts as described. However, these efforts are concentrated in specific areas and, as explored below, some crucial gaps exist that must be addressed in any evolving framework for standards.Lessons learned from standard-setting effortsAs we evaluate the above models of governance, it is important to assess growth opportunities for the next stage of standard developments. In this section, we identify the critical learnings and gaps in standards development for interoperability of digital assets.First, the rCBDC experimentation space has provided countries with some experience in building CBDCs, largely driven by domestic objectives. These experiments are at very different stages and use a range of private-sector vendors that are not subject to the same regulations due to a slower pace of crypto-asset regulation globally.Second, within wCBDC experimentation, operating frameworks in technology and regulation have emerged, led by entities like the BIS Innovation Hub, the global financial-messaging cooperative Swift, and other private-sector players. However, they are constrained by the limited number of participating countries, furthering the issue of fragmentation in cross-border CBDCs. Current experimentation should incorporate standards-setting bodies (SSBs) such as FSB, BCBS, CPMI, ISO, and FATF as participants or observers to ensure better collaboration in the development of standards.The membership structure of SSBs significantly influences the establishment of the goals and priorities of these institutions. Additionally, while emerging market economies often surpass developed economies in the development of digital infrastructure, including CBDCs, they sometimes find themselves underrepresented in setting norms and establishing benchmarks. This underrepresentation can result in an inadequate consideration of their technological advancements within the organization’s priorities.Moreover, apart from the FATF, there seems to be a shortage of robust frameworks for assessing the global standards’ impact and implementation lags. To address the evolving landscape of financial technologies, it is imperative that new and non-financial SSBs be actively involved in these discussions, leveraging their expertise in technological matters and regulatory concerns.Finally, some of the above frameworks have actively involved private sector participants in influencing standard development and creation. As intermediaries, the private sector has a crucial role in the entire lifecycle of standards, from actively influencing the creation of standards to ultimately adopting and implementing them.Towardsestablishing standardsA transparent and collaborative multi-stakeholder approach is crucial for establishing frameworks for standards related to digital currencies. Standardization is driven by consultation processes with governments, industry specialists, consumers, regulators, and civil society organizations (CSOs). Historically, governments have provided the necessary legal and governance paradigms, in turn creating environments conducive to standard development and assimilation across multi-stakeholder groups. Central banking authorities, driven by the imperative of maintaining financial stability and directing monetary policy, contribute a nuanced perspective essential for shaping these standards. The private sector’s technological advancements and practical exposure play a critical role, not just in ideation, but in the tangible implementation of these standards, ensuring their practical efficacy. Lastly, the participation of CSOs provides reflection and inclusion of key social elements, serving as a check by society on the suitability of resulting standards.The goal of this collaborative process is the establishment of a guiding framework for standards. To begin this process, we outlined the following themes for CBDC framework creation, which align with the G7 principles proposed in 2021, to identify the key themes necessary to begin building a framework. These key themes are governance; privacy and data protection; competition and consumer protection; global impact and sustainability; and transferability and accessibility. Through conversations at the conference and outreach afterward, we aimed to test the robustness of these themes through a survey (see Annex 2 for survey questions). Within each theme, we describe the areas of framework development needed for the establishment of standards. Conference attendees and survey respondents identified thematic overlaps and largely agreed with these themes, which have allowed us to set policy priorities for CBDC frameworks.A thematic approach to CBDC and digital asset standard creationGovernanceEffective governance of CBDCs requires a nuanced approach, placing a focus on maintaining public policy objectives and central bank mandates including monetary and financial stability. To achieve this, the framework should involve the creation of dynamic mechanisms that not only monitor, but also proactively mitigate potential destabilizing effects. Stress-testing frameworks are essential tools for central banks to assess the comprehensive impact of CBDCs on economic stability. The principle of “do no harm” dictates that economic stability must be safeguarded at every stage of CBDC implementation, through concrete guidelines and risk assessments. In parallel, there is an imperative to establish legal and governance frameworks, offering clear definitions of regulatory benchmarks. Governance is the biggest challenge that emerges as we analyze existing efforts for standard setting, as each of the technical models discussed at the conference envisions an operator of an inherently global system. This is a complex and difficult endeavor, likely to have many challenges and phases.Privacy and Data ProtectionThe protection of privacy and data involves specifying requirements for user data protection, consent, and disclosures.46The Digital Dollar Project, Digital Dollar Foundation and Accenture.Mechanisms for cross-border data transfer should be designed to navigate the complexities of various data protection laws across jurisdictions, ensuring compliance, individual privacy protections, and seamless transactions. Operational resilience and cybersecurity require technology standards for resilience against cyber, fraud, and operational risks, including security measures, encryption standards, and incident response protocols.47J.

While volatility has shaken cryptocurrency markets over the past year and caused a string of failures, many parts of the digital asset ecosystem continue to advance largely unaffected by the turmoil, as we explored in anearlier paper. These include the areas with the greatest long-term potential to transform finance, including the tokenization of financial assets and deposits and the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) by most of the world’s largest economies. The rise of digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) continues to have the potential to upend the competitive landscape, creating new, efficient, nimble competitors, but also offering incumbents a potential new lease on life. Executives and policymakers need to stay focused on the opportunities and risks associated with digital assets.The future of digital assets as a whole depends heavily on the future of digital money, as payments power the financial system. However, digital money could evolve in quite different ways; for example, there are different forms of digital money that could form the basis of new approaches, spanning CBDCs, tokenized deposits and different types of stablecoins. Executives and policymakers must think in terms of multiple scenarios rather than relying on a single prediction. These approaches will transform business models as they favor different types of issuers and their adoption will reshape liquidity, market-making, and risk management, which could impact the broader financial system considerably.To help industry executives and policymakers frame their thinking, this report presents four paradigms based on the issuers of money, the technology they choose, and the use cases they target. Traditional financial institutions could successfully evolve or be challenged by the rise of digital intermediaries. Alternatively, universal networks could transform financial markets and business models, or sovereigns could expand their control of money and change the role for the private sector and its business models.In a world of significantly higher interest rates, the economic value generated from facilitating payments could be bigger and even more contested. Establishing valuable commercial propositions will be crucial to scaling different forms of digital money. Their viability, in turn, will depend on the policy landscape, technological innovations, and the infrastructure design choices that money issuers make. Each factor will play a role in determining the winners.Policymakers and senior leaders in the financial industry, both incumbents and disruptors, should consider a range of plausible future scenarios, evaluate their potential impact, plan responses for the most likely developments, and consider how to bring about the most desirable outcomes. This process may play out quite differently across cross-border payments, asset settlement, and retail domestic payments. We will follow up in coming months with papers that focus on these specific digital money use cases.The Future ScenariosWhy Focus On The Future of MoneyTechnology has transformed the way we think about and use money from the first electronic payments in the telegraph era to the rise of mobile payments and cryptocurrencies. Today that process is poised to accelerate dramatically. Distributed ledger technology (DLT), such as blockchain, is inspiring the creation of new forms of money, from central bank digital currencies and tokenized deposits to stablecoins. These digital monies have the potential to make payments faster, cheaper, and more secure, and enable new economic activity and business models.This transformation of money will both fuel and be driven by a broader transformation of the financial system. DLT is enabling the creation of a broad array of assets, from digitized versions of traditional financial instruments such as stock and bonds and historically illiquid assets like art, real estate, and intellectual property, to digitally native vehicles that offer novel ways to transfer value. These assets can attract participation by a wider range of entities and investors, as well as change how they participate, fostering the rise of new financial products and business models.Digital assets and technology also will change the shape of financial services and markets. By presenting transactional and ownership information on a single, shared ledger, DLT enables participants to transact with one another without the involvement of traditional financial intermediaries. It enables the automation and coordination of transaction processes among multiple stakeholders, which will change the cost and distribution of financial products. This could spur new private networks that displace existing intermediaries and allow greater automation and integration across borders and asset classes. Alternatively, it could create new opportunities for banks, exchanges, custodians, and other institutions that embrace DLT and adapt their business models.Money is at the heart of these innovations. A thriving digital assets market requires a seamless way to trade these assets. A digitally native solution that embeds money in the same distributed framework as the assets themselves will maximize the speed and cost-effectiveness of payments, as well the connectivity to associated services such as collateral management and yield enhancement. Of course, such a solution needs to be trusted, reliable, sustainable, and secure.While digital assets have the potential to transform the way we store and exchange value, their success ultimately depends on whether they can be integrated with the existing financial system. Such an integration has the potential to enable faster and more secure transactions across the financial system. Payments could be settled instantly and safely, at any time of day, and at the same time assets are exchanged, a process known as atomic settlement. The financial system could change significantly as digital money impacts liquidity, market-making, and risk management given its speed and automation.Evolution of Forms of MoneySource: Adapted fromIt’s Time to Explore Institutional DeFiEstablishing valuable commercial propositions will be key to scaling up digital money, but the viability of those propositions will depend heavily on the policy landscape and technological innovations. Capital and liquidity requirements will have a major impact on the feasibility of commercial propositions, while the integration of digital money across borders can create the critical mass to power new business models. But both of those elements require a coordinated approach by national regulators, which is still in an early phase. At the same time, advances in technology will drive whether platforms can handle the volume of activity needed. New platforms also face the classic chicken-and-egg problem: how to start attracting consumers and producers when the economic value generated by facilitating payments to participants depends on high transaction volume.Key players are making critical investments and strategic decisions now that will shape the future. In a world of significantly higher interest rates, the economic value generated by facilitating payments could be bigger and even more contested. Executives need to start preparing for the ways in which digital money can transform the competitive landscape in which they operate. We present four paradigms to paint the corners for how this transformation might play out. The future of money will likely combine a mix of these different paradigms, and in potentially different proportions across various sectors and use cases. Industry leaders should prepare for thefuture by considering the full range of plausible scenarios.Paradigms For A Changing Competitive LandscapeThe future of money isn't preordained. A vast number of market participants are working to reshape that future. Blockchain and digital native startups are developing innovative products and services that have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. Incumbent institutions like banks are investing in new products, such as digital asset custody and settlement solutions. Fintech firms are already making significant inroads in transforming the way money moves globally. Big tech firms are also exploring the potential for their own digital currencies and payment systems, leveraging their massive user bases and data analytics capabilities. Central banks are researching the potential for digital currencies to complement traditional ones. Finally, regulators will play a critical role in shaping which commercial propositions are both viable and safe.The future of money and payments can take radically different directions depending on the forms of money that gain scale, the technology designs issuers choose and use cases they target, how incentives are incorporated, and whether the regulatory and policy environment is favorable, among other factors.Changes to money itself can have a profound impact on the financial system at large. To help industry executives and policymakers frame their thinking, we introduce four paradigms based on the types of institutions that could produce solutions that scale. These paradigms are meant to support scenario planning and are likely to coexist. They are not comprehensive and do not cover every possibility, such as a future in which cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin become a major part of the payments system.Four ParadigmsPARADIGM ONETraditional Finance EvolvesDigital assets support the continued centrality of banks and other financial institutionThis paradigm represents an evolution of the existing system, not a revolution, as banks and other incumbent financial institutions continue to dominate. (We will generally say “banks” for short.) It assumes that banks largely evolve successfully, with digital money supporting their continued centrality to the financial system.For this paradigm to take hold, financial institutions need to demonstrate the commercial value of digital assets. Experimentation will lead to viable business models as banks become leading enablers for the new technologies, tokenizing both money and assets. Momentum could grow as solutions cascade across the system, from core activities like asset issuance and treasury to areas like merchant solutions and payments. Policymakers will be key enablers, providing regulatory space for innovation and potentially pushing new networks that reinforce banks’ position. This paradigm also will become more likely if regulation slows down digital natives or puts limits on potential commercial models.If banks can evolve successfully, they would thrive by ensuring their key economic and intermediation roles, pursuing new opportunities while providing balance sheet to support trading and lending activities in new infrastructures that lower their cost bases. Modernization of payments and trading could drive major efficiencies for clients by reducing liquidity needs, which would impact banking costs and revenues. This could increase market concentration as smaller players are squeezed out by margin pressure as well as the cost of adopting new infrastructure and the fight for talent. Even as banks evolve, institutions would continue to face strong competition for client relationships, including from big tech.PARADIGM TWOSovereign ExpansionCentral banks use CBDCs to gain share in payment flowsIn this paradigm, central banks would provide retail or wholesale users with CBDCs and use their instantaneous settlement capabilities to pick up a significant share of payment flows. Although central banks considering CBDCs are currently aiming to play a core role in payments without greatly disturbing the existing financial system, this paradigm assumes the process goes much further than current plans and does indeed transform the system.Radical change in the role of the central bank would require societal support. Individuals could come to prefer the features provided by retail CBDCs. Alternatively, demand could be driven by investors and institutions who want to ensure their digital money is fully backstopped by the central bank. This diversion of payment flows from private money to public could have a significant impact on bank business models, which would have to rely more on equity and wholesale funding rather than deposits.While the role of the private sector in money issuance might decrease, central banks might continue to partner with the private sector to distribute and maintain access to money. This could mean new opportunities and fee-based business models focused on the distribution and allocation of public money. Banks could find themselves in tough competition with payment service providers or new digital intermediaries. There could be an increased role for technology companies in providing payment services and infrastructure, as central bank money is integrated into mainstream payment systems.With public money having a greater role in the economy, central banks may then have more tools to enact and control monetary supply, as well as more real-time data. This paradigm could lead to greater financial stability as central banks gain more visibility and control over the money supply, but also create the potential for unintended consequences and new risks to emerge. Financial institutions would need to adjust their business models to account for the change in payment flows, particularly interms of their balance sheets and funding models.PARADIGM THREERise of Digital IntermediariesIn between evolution and revolutionThis paradigm sits somewhere between evolution and revolution, with digital natives gaining scale as the traditional financial industry struggles to adapt. Banking could be squeezed, with digital natives controlling customer access and expanding financial services provided.This paradigm can take shape if digital assets gain scale with intermediaries carving out key areas for differentiation. This could include a trusted digital money solution, with stablecoin issuers gaining scale, or efficient and compliant market infrastructure solutions, such as cryptocurrency exchanges concentrating liquidity. To capture institutional flow, digital intermediaries will need regulatory acceptance of their business models. Profitability of digital natives would enable them to launch compelling new services across financial services, including lending, origination, and liquidity provision, while traditional finance players work to overcome legacy technology, culture, and regulatory obstacles. Integration across services could be established through cooperation across the value chain, or itself become a way for new digital intermediaries to emerge that provide the range of services.Powerful new companies could emerge that operate globally and squeeze other financial institutions out of client relationships, potentially starting with younger, early adopters. As a result, competition between financial services providers would start to move from control of operating accounts to custody, as money increasingly moves into stablecoins held in digital wallets. This suggests banks and financial market infrastructure firms would be hit by multiple pressures, including loss of business, pressure to pivot business models, and costs to accelerate digital asset capabilities. Beyond banks, competition between digital natives could also accelerate and would likely include the entry of big tech players. Smaller proprietary networks might push for interoperability to ensure continued relevance.PARADIGM FOURUniversal NetworksRevolution – the financial system as we knowit is transformedThis is the most radical paradigm, one that would strongly transform the financial system. The rise of new open networks would enable borrowers and lenders, issuers and investors, and other market participants to deal directly, without intermediaries. Transactions would be powered and governed by smart contracts and institutional decentralized finance protocols. The trend toward capital market-based financing would be accelerated by algorithmic creation and allocation of credit over highly integrated networks. This could disrupt the business models of banks and today's digital natives.Radical change would require high levels of support. Policymakers could become more comfortable with this paradigm if there are trusted solutions to compliance and safeguards in existing networks. Alternatively, supranational organizations could enable cross-country collaboration for new platforms, such as the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) vision for a unified global ledger or the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) proposal for a multi-currency marketplace. It’s also possible that trust is built over time through experimentation with new policy tools. The European Commission, for example, put out a tender for a study on embedded supervision of decentralized finance. Networks that are truly universal will also depend on convergence around shared standards, as well as continued advances in technology that enable both scale and trust.This paradigm would imply greater participation and expansion of capital markets, but participation models could change dramatically as users and investors are connected by automation instead of intermediaries. This would require financial services providers (or new types of organizations) making using of automation to also expand risk management capabilities and successfully build incentive models. If users can control their data and wallets, that could encourage new services that blur the lines between banking and commerce, enabling financial activities to become embedded and seamless. With the growth and expansion of market-based financing, investors and firms alike would need to become more sophisticated about risk management.From Paradigms To SolutionsParticipants are already planting the seeds of these various paradigms. Policymakers are taking decisions and companies are exploring commercial propositions that will determine which forms of money are viable. The networks where digital money is issued and gains scale will define who is in the running to offer new services. These seeds won’t sprout overnight but senior executives need to start preparing now. Money has network effects and digital money could scale at a rapid pace.Contesting Forms of Digital MoneyCompeting forms of moneyCompeting forms of money will feature different business models and economics for their issuers and will need to win the trust of users that nominal value can be maintained. Generally, issuers make a profit by earning an interest margin on the assets backing the money and by collecting fees on payments, transactions, and bundled services, while ensuring trust by appropriately backing the issuance. In a world of higher interest rates, the economic value generated from facilitating payments becomes more attractive.Central bank digital currenciesare a digital form of central bank liability.Many central banks are exploring CBDCs to ensure the money they issue continues as an anchor of value in an increasingly digital world. A retail CBDC would serve as a modern version of paper currency or coins: made available to all individuals but digitally native and more similar in experience to a bank account, with similar levels of data access by authorities. Several major economies are expected to launch retail CBDCs within the next five years, including China (which has been working on a digital yuan project since 2014), India, and the European Union. An expansive retail CBDC could divert deposits from the banking system, increase bank funding costs, and reduce bank interest income, which explains why many banks oppose the idea. Some central banks are looking to cap the amount an individual or firm may hold in CBDCs and ensure they seamlessly integrate with deposits, which could favor banks. On the other hand, CBDCs might create new fee-based income opportunities for payment service providers that partner in distribution, favoring new digital intermediaries.A wholesale CBDC is a modern version of reserves issued on new central bank platforms to help financial institutions, not consumers, transact more efficiently with each other. Countries are exploring them mainly for cross-border payments and to settle asset transactions. By speeding up wholesale payments, they would reduce the need for banks and corporations to tie up liquidity for two or more days. A wholesale CBDC would retain the two-tier structure of today’s financial system, whereby central bank money underpins private money creation by commercial banks and others. The paradigm it favors will depend on which types of institutions have access to wholesale CBDCs.Tokenized depositsare a digital form of a bank deposit issued by a regulated institution.They are recorded on a distributed ledger and intended to settle trades of tokenized real-world assets or other digital assets. Tokenized deposits could take on different forms, whether account or token-based. Financial institutions and central banks have only recently begun experimenting with these instruments, and many issues remain to be resolved in both regulation and business models. For example, from a regulatory perspective, it’s not clear how capital and liquidity requirements might need to evolve if tokenized deposits lead to different behaviors and usage. It’s also not clear how deposits from different institutions will be made interchangeable and whether new business models will emerge to solve for that.Issuing tokenized deposits would favor banks’ economic position by helping to secure their funding, which has traditionally relied on customer deposits, and providing a currency for participating in the digital asset sector. This could be a key driver for traditional finance to evolve successfully.Fiat-backed stablecoinsdigital assets designed to maintain a stable value against a national currency, such as the US dollar, backed by assets denominated in that currency.These instruments play a major role in crypto markets, with more than $7 trillion in transactions executed in 2022, and issuers are exploring their use for real-world payments. Most stablecoins do not pay interest, unlike deposits, which can provide significant value to issuers in a rising interest rate environment. They also generate fee income from transaction and treasury services that scale up with volume growth. Digital natives dominate the stablecoin market and they could develop powerful new intermediary roles as the use of these coins proliferates. Financial institutions have recently begun to issue their own stablecoins.Stablecoin growth will require coherent regulation, and potentially adjustments to existing business models. Maintaining a peg against the dollar or other currency depends both on appropriate reserves to manage normal outflows as well as access to backstops in the case of systemic events. The importance of maintaining a peg was highlighted by recent contagion events in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, where concerns around traditional finance deposits spread to crypto markets. Stablecoin regulation has evolved at a different rate across the globe. For example, the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) regulation mandates that issuers hold reserves to back their coins; however, the United States might take years to develop comparable rules, given the need for legislation from a divided Congress.Decentralized stablecoinsare private sector-issued digital assets designed to maintain a stable value while backed by other digital assets.These represent a small fraction of total stablecoin transactions and their regulatory path is not as clear as fiat-backed stablecoins, especially given their reliance on decentralized governance. After the Terra/Luna collapse of 2022, coins relying on algorithms to maintain a peg have lost favor to designs based on overcollateralization. These stablecoins generate interest income from overcollateralized reserves, as well as fees from executing trades and collateral liquidation from margin calls.While a small fraction of current market activity, decentralized stablecoins could represent the frontier of innovation, making use of smart contracts and new governance designs to manage their balance sheets and distribute the economic value from issuance.These options are not exhaustive. The ease of swapping different digital assets through smart contracts means a wider variety of tokens can function like money to exchange value in a transaction. This can blur the lines between money and assets, enabling new business models while also creating new policy challenges. For example, funds kept with traditional money market funds need to be withdrawn to be used in payments, but this could change if money market fund tokens are recognized as means of payment in smart contracts or networks.Competing market infrastructure designsMarket infrastructure design and participation is becoming a key strategic and policy issue. In the traditional financial system, money and assets exist on separate networks, where banks have a privileged role in helping settle transactions. DLT-inspired technologies could upend this system and disintermediate banks. The more integrated and universal the network – that is, the greater diversity of assets and stakeholders that a distributed network contains – the higher the likelihood that new business models could emerge and disrupt banks.Because there are significant network benefits with digital money and assets, market infrastructures that are early in gaining scale might later be hard to disrupt. A variety of network designs have emerged, ranging from open, permissionless networks that defy national borders to tightly controlled ones, each one with different economics. Senior executives should understand the motivation, opportunities, and challenges for each design.Closed (permissioned) networksimpose limitations on who can access and manage the network. Financial institutions have used this option in digital asset experiments because it aligns closely with their existing business model as regulated providers of financial services. It also has greater policy support given the greater level of control and the ability to rely on existing approaches to manage risk and compliance. For example, the BIS advocates this approach in its vision of a unified global ledger.This type of network could be the least disruptive to the financial industry, while also leading to a reshuffling within the industry if some banks are slow to adapt. However, if only a few banks and participants join, it could make it harder for any network to scale up and develop a rich digital assets ecosystem.By contrast, inopen (permissionless) networks, participation is limited only by economic realities. This is the approach used by most crypto networks today. Given the challenges with enforcing compliance and regulation when there are no restrictions on access and usage, many in the industry are looking to build a “trust layer” to ensure transactions take place only among verified participants. Banks that have issued digital bonds and stablecoins on public networks have followed this approach. Project Guardian by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was an example of experimentation by the public sector. As discussed inour paper on the project, broader industry efforts are needed to scale this solution, including the creation of legal clarity, standards, and guardrails. A trust layer could enable digital natives to launchinnovative new services in lending, origination, and financing in a manner that gains policy support.Emerging Use CasesThe future of money is highly unlikely to be monochrome, with every sector adopting the same instruments, technology designs, and business models. Instead, it will grow use case by use case, driven by preferences and decisions made across business segments and geographies. The future will likely combine elements of some or all of the four paradigms. Here, we look at how these factors might play out among some of the most likely competitors across three major use cases – cross-border payments, asset settlement, and domestic retail payments.Cross-border paymentsSending money from one country to another can be a costly and prolonged process.Our joint papershowed that corporates move more than $23 trillion across borders each year and incur roughly $120 billion in transaction costs. A common digital platform linking national CBDCs to enable real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments could slash corporate transaction costs by more than 80%, or $100 billion a year.Over 30 countries have already started experimenting with using CBDCs for cross-border payments. In a pilot project with the BIS, the central banks of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates showed that digital ledger technology could execute trades between the four parties’ digital currencies in seconds and reduce costs as much as 50% by cutting out correspondent banks and streamlining liquidity management. Meanwhile, new market infrastructures and business models are emerging. Banks have launched consortia that use blockchain technology for multi-currency FX net settlement and for payment-versus-payment capability. New stablecoins are emerging pegged to new currencies, with MiCA providing regulatory clarity for euro-pegged stablecoins. The cross-border opportunity is vast but the challenge facing all innovators is the need for coordination, harmonization, and interoperability between so many jurisdictions and technology platforms.Asset settlementTraditional asset settlement, while largely electronic, is still costly, time-consuming, and complicated. Processes are fragmented by asset classes and jurisdictions, with limited standardization. Digital money could introduce some greater efficiencies, but it would require the widespread tokenization of a range of assets to reap the full benefits of settling trades in CBDCs or stablecoins or tokenized deposits. We are far from that point, with total digital bond issuance amounting to just $1.5 billion currently, a tiny fraction of the $127 trillion global fixed-income market.Digital payment solutions could enable a variety of technology firms to compete with global custodians that have traditionally dominated this space. Institutional DeFi protocols can automate financial transactions and provide a more decentralized and secure way of settling assets and automating risk-management practices. Real-time settlement based on delivery versus payment can reduce the risk of counterparty default and free up capital for other purposes. Banks, custodians, and other traditional intermediaries will need to adapt quickly to harness these changes. Estimates on the expected size of tokenized asset markets vary widely, but there could be reinforcing benefits to redesigning both asset forms and the money that’s used to settle transactions, which would accelerate the rate of change.Retail domestic paymentsCentral bank digital currencies will be a big wild card in retail payments, with roughly 100 jurisdictions around the world exploring the issuance of CBDCs or having already done so. Few CBDC projects make use of DLT, while many leave the development of new payment features to the private sector. This could unleash competition between the firms that dominate payments today and blockchain-native innovators offering new value-added services based on programmable smart contracts or loyalty features like rewards programs. Stablecoin issuers are already looking to apply their technology to real-world retail payments. Open infrastructures that allow users to exercise more control over their data, an integral part of web3 ecosystems, could gain favor with consumers.The paradigms presented in this paper can help banks, businesses, and policymakers as they consider their next steps, but they aren’t mutually exclusive.We are likely to see some if not all of these types of money coexist and play a growing role, depending on whether they are being used for retail transactions at the corner store or to finance multi-billion-dollar cross-border trade deals or investments. In subsequent papers, we will explore these different use cases in much more detail, and we will examine how the paradigms could play out under different scenarios and what industry leaders should be doingtoday.AuthorsLarissa de Lima,Jason EkbergandDouglas J.

Central Bank Digital Currencies: Bridging Innovation and StabilityCentral Bank Digital Currencies: Bridging Innovation and StabilityIn a world increasingly dominated by digital innovation, the emergence ofcentral bank digital currencies (CBDCs)marks a pivotal evolution in the financial sector. Unlike traditional money,CBDCsoffer a digital alternative that is both backed and issued by national central banks, combining the benefits of digital transactions with the stability of government-backed currency. Understanding the depth and breadth ofCBDCsis crucial for financial experts navigating the future of finance.The Evolution of Money and Introduction of CBDCsMoney has seen significant transformations over the centuries, evolving from barter systems to banknotes and now to digital banking.CBDCsrepresent the next step, aiming to modernize financial services to be more resilient and inclusive. Central banks like theEuropean Central Bankand theFederal Reserveare exploringCBDCsto stay at the forefront of technological innovation while safeguarding monetary sovereignty.Technological UnderpinningsCBDCsare digital currencies issued by central banks that hold legal tender status, bridging the gap between digital and physical economies. While some countries opt for blockchain technology to leverage decentralization, transparency, and security, others prefer a centralized approach to maintain tighter control. Key technological considerations forCBDCsinclude:Scalability:Ensuring the system can handle large volumes of transactions.Security:Implementing robust defenses against cyber threats and fraud.Interoperability:Facilitating seamless integration with existing financial technologies.Privacy:Balancing transparency with individual rights to privacy.Worldwide Implementation EffortsDifferent nations have taken unique approaches to deployingCBDCs, reflecting their diverse economic contexts and objectives:Sweden’s E-krona:Developed in response to dwindling cash usage, aiming to secure public access to trusted money in a digital format.China’s Digital Yuan:Part of a broader initiative to increase China’s influence in the global financial system.Eastern Caribbean’s DCash:Implemented to improve financial accessibility and resilience in a region prone to natural disasters.Advantages of CBDCsCBDCsoffer numerous advantages, including:Efficiency:Streamlining payments and settlements, enhancing economic activity and reducing transaction costs.Financial Inclusion:Providing a gateway for financial services to populations typically outside the banking system.Reduced Operational Costs:Digital formats decrease costs related to printing, distributing, and securing physical currency.Monetary Sovereignty:Helping countries assert control over their monetary systems.Stability:Offering a secure alternative to private digital currencies and volatile cryptocurrencies.Economic and Market ImplicationsThe implementation ofCBDCscould significantly impact monetary policy and financial stability. By providing central banks with a new tool for conducting monetary policy,CBDCscould enhance control over the money supply and interest rates. They may also influence the banking system by providing individuals with direct access to the central bank’s resources, potentially reducing transaction costs and increasing speed.CBDCscarry significant implications for the global financial marketplace, including:Banking Sector Dynamics:With the potential to hold funds directly with the central bank, consumers might chooseCBDCsover traditional bank deposits.International Trade:Facilitating easier and cheaper cross-border transactions, potentially reshaping economic engagement.Innovation and Competition:Spurring innovation within the private sector, pushing financial institutions to enhance their service offerings.Despite the potential benefits,CBDCsraise significant issues, particularly regarding privacy and data security. Ensuring aCBDCsystem is secure against cyberattacks while maintaining user privacy is a complex challenge.Regulatory and Policy FrameworksThe successful rollout ofCBDCswill require comprehensiveregulatory frameworksto address potential risks and ensure smooth operation. These frameworks need to tackle issues related to cybersecurity, privacy, legal tender status, and international cooperation.

As digital currencies become more integrated into the global financial system, they may offer a more inclusive and efficient financial framework but will require careful implementation to balance innovation with stability.CBDCspresent a profound opportunity to enhance financial transactions, promoting greater efficiency, inclusivity, and stability. However, their successful integration demands careful consideration of technological choices, impact assessments on existing financial structures, and robust regulatory measures.The information provided here is not investment, tax, or financial advice.

Meanwhile, the30-year refinance rateis averaging slightly higher at6.814%.Freddie Mac reported a notable rise in the average rate for a30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which jumped to6.32%, marking an increase of0.20 percentage pointsfrom the previous week. Similarly, the15-year fixed-rate mortgagesaw an uptick, averaging5.41%, with a0.16 percentage pointincrease.Despite these increases,mortgage ratesremain nearly a full percentage point lower than the year’s high of7.22%. This trend reflects the largest week-over-week increase since last April. In a press release, Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, emphasized that while higher rates present challenges for prospective buyers, the underlying strength of the U.S. economy “should continue to support the recovery of the housing market.”For those navigating thecurrent mortgage landscape, it’s crucial to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders.

Additionally, utilizing Money’smortgage calculatorcan help borrowers estimate their monthly payments under different rate scenarios.Understanding Mortgage Rate TrendsThe recent rise inmortgage ratesis partly attributed to last week’s better-than-expected jobs report, which sent yields on10-year Treasury bondshigher, subsequently pulling mortgage rates up as well. As more economic data emerges, prospective buyers should brace for continued volatility in the near term.When consideringmortgage options, it’s essential to understand the differences betweenfixed-rateandadjustable-rate mortgages. Fixed-rate loans offer stability with a consistent interest rate throughout the loan’s duration, while adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) begin with a fixed rate that later adjusts at regular intervals.Factors Influencing Mortgage RatesLoan Term:Longer loans typically have smaller payments but may cost more overall.Loan Type:Fixed-rate loans offer steady payments, while ARMs adjust periodically.Economic Factors:Rates are influenced by the federal funds rate, Treasury yields, and borrower qualifications.For those contemplating refinancing, it’s crucial to weigh the pros and cons, asrefinance ratestend to be higher.

Here’s a detailed look at the anticipated trends and changes.2025 ForecastThehousing market in 2025is expected to see a slight rise inhome prices, projected to be between 1% and 2% above current inflation rates. This growth is anticipated due to increased real incomes and lower mortgage rates, which will enhance affordability. As millennials reach their prime home-buying age, demand is expected to rise, with new constructions attempting to mitigate the ongoing inventory shortage. Despite improvements, underbuilding will continue to affect market dynamics.2026 OutlookIn 2026, more buyers are likely to collaborate with family and friends to manage high housing costs. Emerging technologies are set to revolutionizehome construction, making it faster and more cost-efficient. Builders will be urged to consider the rising costs associated withclimate change, focusing on sustainability and resilience in new developments.2027 ExpectationsLooking towards 2027, demographic trends such as urbanization and shifts in worker preferences due to remote work will influencemarket demand.

These laws, approved by Governor Ron DeSantis, are designed to enhance affordability and protection for residents, touching on various aspects of the real estate industry.Boosting Housing ProgramsAt the forefront is theHometown Heroes Housing Program (SB 328), which sees an additional $100 million allocated to aid first-time homebuyers, particularly those in essential service roles such as teachers and healthcare workers. This initiative aligns with previous efforts to stimulate private investment in affordable housing, providing necessary guidance on local zoning and density regulations. Realtors are encouraged to direct clients to theHometown Heroes Program.In a similar vein, theMy Safe Florida Home Program (SB 7028)receives a $200 million boost, aimed at empowering homeowners to fortify their homes against severe weather, thereby reducing insurance costs. The program now includes free inspections and grants up to $10,000 for low-income homeowners without the need for matching funds. More details can be foundhere.Expanding Protection to CondosTheMy Safe Florida Condominium Pilot Program (HB 1029)extends these protective measures to coastal condominiums, with $30 million dedicated to strengthening roofs and openings against storms. Information for interested parties is availablehere.Additionally, theProtecting Private Property Rights (HB 62)law addresses the issue of illegal squatting, allowing property owners to swiftly evict unauthorized occupants, further details of which can be accessedhere.Financial and Environmental InitiativesLawmakers have earmarked $408 million for state and local affordable housing programs, alongside a mandate for a 1.75% deduction in property insurance premiums underProperty Insurance Cost Reductions (HB 7073). These measures aim to alleviate financial pressures on homeowners.Environmental efforts are bolstered with over $1.2 billion allocated for water quality initiatives, including Everglades restoration and mitigation of harmful algal blooms.Looking AheadFuture legislation includes increased transparency in condominium and homeowners’ association documents, with requirements for digital accessibility. Upcoming laws will also mandate seller flood disclosures and digital record-keeping for homeowner associations, with phased implementation over the next few years.These legislative changes, as highlighted in theoriginal article, reflect a proactive approach by Florida’s legislative assembly and Florida Realtors to address critical housing and environmental issues, promising widespread benefits for Floridians.Read More1310, 2024Opportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesGalleryOpportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesArticle,Housing Market,Mortgage RatesOpportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-13T23:48:49-04:00October 13, 2024|Categories:Article,Housing Market,Mortgage Rates|Tags:Home Buying,Real Estate|0 CommentsAfter weeks of steady declines,mortgage rateshave finally reached a range that brings the dream of homeownership closer for many hopeful buyers. This shift suggests potential relief in the inflated housing market, offering buyers increased purchasing power despite ongoing high home prices. Experts indicate that the current conditions could favor those looking to enter the housing market before potential demand surges occur once again.Although home prices continue to break records, price growth is slowing due to loosening inventory and sluggish demand. Buyers are gaining leverage when negotiating with sellers, creating a window of opportunity for those ready to make a move.Despite the positive trend inmortgage rates, many potential buyers remain cautious, waiting for further Federal Reserve rate cuts that could lead to even lower mortgage rates. However, experts warn that waiting too long could result in missing out on favorable market conditions. Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, suggests that lower rates this fall could coincide with slower home price growth as more sellers enter the market and inventory rises.Housing Market Forecast for 2024 and 2025The U.S. housing market continues to be a hot topic, withhome pricesposting a 5% annual gain according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index. While this is a slowdown from June’s 5.5% gain, home prices remain at record highs, making affordability a challenge for many.Ralph McLaughlin, senior economist at Realtor.com, echoes the sentiment that home price growth will slow before rebounding. He notes that withmortgage ratesfalling to 24-month lows and a high probability of further rate reductions, home price growth could bottom out before reaccelerating as buyer purchasing power improves.Can We Expect a Housing Market Recovery in 2025?For a housing recovery to take place, several conditions need to unfold. Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH.com, suggests that inventories of homes for sale must increase significantly to ease upward pressure on prices. The recent decline inmortgage ratesis beginning to help loosen inventory, albeit gradually.After peaking at 7.79% in October 2023, the average 30-year fixedmortgage ratehas been below 6.5% since mid-August, landing at 6.12% the week ending October 3. This trend, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut, offers a glimmer of hope for potential buyers.NAR Practice Changes: What Buyers and Sellers Need To KnowIn a landmark settlement, theNational Association of Realtors (NAR)agreed to pay $418 million to settle antitrust lawsuits, leading to new rules that promote a more transparent home-buying process. These changes, effective since August 17, aim to benefit both consumers and agents by clarifying the financial aspects of real estate transactions.For decades, it was standard practice for home sellers to cover the buyer’s broker commission, but now buyers must enter into written agreements with agents before touring homes. Buyers can negotiate commission payments, adding a new layer of complexity to the transaction process.How Will the New Rules Impact Affordability?With buyers more likely to be responsible for paying broker commissions, affordability concerns arise. Matt Side from Realty ONE Group Eclipse notes that buyers with fewer resources could be particularly affected. However, he advises that sellers will continue to offer compensation to buyer representatives to increase demand for their homes.Housing Inventory Forecast: When Will There Be Sufficient Supply To Reduce Prices?Despite more resale and new homes entering the market, inventory remains well below pre-Covid averages. Many homeowners are “locked in” at ultra-low mortgage rates, unwilling to exchange for higher rates in a high-priced market, leading to demand outpacing supply.Rick Sharga, founder and CEO of CJ Patrick Company, suggests that a meaningful increase in supply won’t occur untilmortgage ratesreturn to the low 5% range, likely not in 2024. However, declining rates could loosen the lock-in effect, providing some much-needed housing supply.Will the Housing Market Crash in 2025?Concerns about a housing market crash akin to 2008 are prevalent, but experts like Tom Hutchens from Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions believe the record-low supply of houses protects against such a scenario. Today’s homeowners are on more secure footing, with many having substantial home equity.Jess Schulman from Bluebird Lending agrees, noting that further Fed rate cuts could lead to more transactions and potential home price increases due to pent-up demand.Will 2024 or 2025 Be Better to Buy a Home?Buying a house is a highly personal decision, and while predicting future market conditions is challenging, experts advise against waiting for the perfect moment. Orphe Divounguy from Zillow Home Loans suggests that the best time to buy is when you find a home that meets your needs and budget.Keith Gumbinger concurs, warning that waiting for better conditions may not be the best strategy, as home prices generally keep rising, moving the goalposts for amassing a down payment.In conclusion, while the housing market presents challenges, there are opportunities for those ready to navigate the complexities. Asmortgage ratesdecline and home prices stabilize, potential buyers and sellers must stay informed and prepared to make the most of the evolving landscape.Read More1310, 2024The $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkGalleryThe $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkArticle,Real Estate,Remote WorkThe $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-13T22:48:34-04:00October 13, 2024|Categories:Article,Real Estate,Remote Work|Tags:housing market,Secondary Cities|0 CommentsIn the ever-evolving landscape ofreal estate, the nationalhousing markethas reached a staggering valuation of $47.5 trillion, marking a $2.4 trillion increase over the past year. This remarkable growth, as highlighted in apreliminary Redfin analysis, underscores the profound impact ofremote workon housing trends.Remote Work and Secondary CitiesA key driver of this surge is the allure ofremote work, which has reshaped the demand for housing in specific metropolitan areas. More affordable cities, often referred to as “secondary cities,” have emerged as significant beneficiaries. For instance, Newark, New Jersey, and New Haven, Connecticut, experienced notable increases in home values, with Newark’shousing marketskyrocketing by 12.8% over the last year. This trend is largely due to their proximity to larger urban centers and their appeal to those priced out of expensive metros like New York.The Subcity PhenomenonThe concept of a “subcity,” as described in acolloquial definition, plays a crucial role in this dynamic. These are cities that function as secondary hubs to larger metropolitan areas. With theremote worktrend solidifying into a hybrid model, thesesubcitieshave become attractive alternatives, offering affordability and accessibility.Winners and Losers in the Housing MarketWhilesecondary citiesflourish, traditional boomtowns and high-cost areas have faced stagnation or decline. Cities like Boise, Idaho, and New York City saw declines in home values, attributed to their already high prices or pandemic-fueled influxes that have since waned. Meanwhile, suburban and rural areas have also seen growth, with suburban home values rising by 5.6% to about $29 trillion.Challenges for Prospective BuyersDespite the overall market growth, prospective buyers face significant challenges. Elevated mortgage rates, limited inventory, and high home prices have made homeownership increasingly unaffordable. Asreported by Fortune, thehousing marketexperienced a freeze, with existing home sales plummeting to their lowest point in nearly three decades.However, there is a silver lining. Experts anticipate that mortgage rates may start to decline before the end of 2024, potentially easing affordability concerns. Until then, homeowners continue to hold substantial housing wealth, benefiting from the supply shortage that maintains elevated home values.ConclusionAs thehousing marketcontinues to evolve, the interplay betweenremote work,secondary cities, and economic factors will remain pivotal.

If the trend of declining high inflation continues, it could align with the Federal Reserve’s targets, leading to reduced volatility in mortgage rates. This environment may prove more favorable for buyers grappling with affordability concerns.Technological Advancements and Demographic ShiftsThe housing market is also expected to be influenced bytechnological advancementsand changes in buyer demographics. Emerging technologies, such asvirtual toursanddata analytics, are reshaping how homes are bought and sold.

This increase will be driven by factors such as the rise in real incomes, lower mortgage rates, and increased affordability. However, it may take time to reach the home value heights of mid-2022.The trend of buyers pooling resources with friends and family to purchase homes is expected to continue, as the rising cost of housing drives people to seek more space and privacy. This shift is likely to result in more multi-generational households and co-living arrangements.The 2028 Housing Market: A Buyer’s or Seller’s Paradise?Looking further ahead to 2028, the market is expected to experience gradual price increases, with an annual appreciation of 1-2%.

According toEducationData.org’s 2023 report, the average federal student loan borrower owes $37,574, while private borrowers face an even steeper average of $54,921. With these daunting figures, many are considering unconventional methods to ease their financial burden.Contact Your LenderFor those with private loans, reaching out to your lender can reveal whether credit card payments are an option. While not all lenders offer this flexibility, some do, providing a possible avenue for managing payments more conveniently.Utilize Third-Party Payment PlatformsFederal student loan borrowers might consider third-party platforms likePaySimplyandPlastiq. These services enable payments via credit card by converting them into wire transfers or cash equivalents, although fees ranging from 2.5% to 3% can offset any potential rewards benefits.Consider a Balance TransferFor those nearing the end of their loan term, transferring the balance to a0% APR balance transfer credit cardcould be a viable option. This method can provide an interest-free period of up to 21 months, though it comes with a transfer fee of 2% to 3%.Creative BudgetingA strategic approach involves reallocating expenses. For example, paying for groceries with a credit card can free up cash for student loan payments, achieving the same financial effect without direct loan charges.Cash AdvancesWhile not ideal due to highAPRrates and immediate interest accrual, cash advances can be a last-resort option. Borrowers should weigh the costs carefully before proceeding.Explore Deferment and ForbearanceFederal loan holders should exploredeferment and forbearanceoptions, which offer payment relief without credit damage. Private lenders may also provide hardship plans, though these vary by institution.While these strategies can provide temporary relief, borrowers must remain vigilant about the potential pitfalls, such as high interest rates and the risk of accumulating more debt.

This surge, marking its peak in June 2024, presents a formidable challenge for home builders already navigating inflated expenses.The escalating cost of building materials, includingsoftwood lumber, steel, and aluminum, is eroding housing affordability. These volatile prices, compounded by uncertainties in production timelines, leave builders grappling with cost management, often resulting in appraisals that fail to reflect true costs accurately.Factors Driving Material Cost IncreasesSupply and Demand:Peak construction seasons intensify demand, while global shortages and disruptions constrain supply, driving up prices.Inflation:Economy-wide inflationary pressures inevitably impact construction material costs.Global Influences:Geopolitical tensions and trade disputes further exacerbate price hikes.Sustainability Initiatives:The shift towardssustainable building practicesoften involves costlier materials.The construction industry feels the strain as these factors inflate project costs, squeeze profit margins, and exacerbate housing affordability issues. Developers face delayed production cycles and heightened financial risks, while appraisals struggle to keep pace with cost fluctuations.Strategies to Mitigate Material Cost ChallengesBuilders are employing a range of strategies to manage these rising costs:Long-term Contracts:Securing consistent pricing through long-term agreements with suppliers.Efficient Material Use:Minimizing waste and optimizing material usage.Negotiation:Engaging suppliers directly to negotiate better prices.Exploring Alternatives:Considering cost-effective materials that deliver similar performance.Efforts to resolve trade disputes and centralize negotiations are underway, aiming to stabilize global material supplies.

Mind the Gap: Assessing the Market Implications of Retail Central Bank Digital CurrenciesNovember 14, 2024byRaj DhamodharanAuthorsDhamodharan Dhamodharan[1]Executive Vice President, Blockchain & Digital Assets at Mastercard.IntroductionCentral banks around the world have rapidly accelerated their exploration of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), conducting in-depth economic analysis, technical proofs-of- concept, and even large-scale pilots to understand the role that a CBDC could play in achieving their economic and policy objectives. As part of this exploration, central banks are carefully considering the feasibility of retail CBDCs[2]References to CBDCs in this paper are referring to retail CBDCs unless otherwise specified.as they continually strive to strengthen and grow their economies with greater innovation and efficiency. To do this, they will necessarily have to engage an ecosystem of participating banks, payment service providers, data service providers, payment networks, and a variety of technology resources. Collectively, it will be critical that there is active public-private collaboration to consider the impact that CBDCs may have on the future of payments and how best to safeguard the interests of consumers and businesses.Exploring the promise of new technology and the potential efficiency gains that adoption could bring has been an essential part of the modernisation journey. Innovative new solutions have been the drivers for sustainable and inclusive economic growth that benefit everyone, everywhere. However, the success of innovative payment solutions has always been contingent on whether they fundamentally address any perceived gaps in the market that existing solutions and services do not already adequately serve. It also depends on whether consumers and businesses believe that new payment innovations are superior to the (digital) solutions already available.Importantly in case of CBDCs, it will also be contingent on who is best placed to provide this innovation. Unlike commercial payment solutions offered today, retail CBDCs raise the more fundamental questions of whether central banks should be in the business of providing retail payments to customers and the broader implications this may have on competition. There are also problematic assumptions made in relation to retail CBDCs that relate to their need to mimic cash-like convenience, which has a direct impact on business models, distorting market dynamics and risking instability.This paper challenges the motivations and the assumptions made by central banks on how retail CBDCs would be delivered under so-called “two-tier” intermediated models. Section 1 explores the motivations outlined by central banks, and questions whether retail CBDCs are intended to act as “monetary anchors” for stability or, whether they are instead being designed as central bank-led market solutions. Section 2 then discusses the notion that a retail CBDC would be delivered under a two-tier intermediated model, highlighting the vast gaps between how the roles of industry participants for retail CBDCs are envisaged and how the current intermediated financial system operates today. Section 3 then delves into the commercial model for delivering a retail CBDC, which for many central banks, is expected to be offered free of charge to customers just like their cash equivalents. The paper concludes with the principles that will be needed for CBDCs to successfully address user needs, and importantly how the market can help deliver and distribute CBDCs.Central bank digital currencies: Monetary anchor or market solution?Today, there are 134 countries & currency unions, representing 98 per cent of global GDP, exploring both wholesale and retail CBDCs.[3]See the Atlantic Council’s CBDC Tracker athttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/Central banks’ motivations for exploring CBDCs vary across jurisdictions. Key goals often cited by central banks include creating a digital substitute for cash in an increasingly digital society, improving control over monetary policy, achieving geopolitical and strategic autonomy, enhancing resilience, increasing the speed of payments, reducing their cost, and facilitating financial inclusion. Above all, central banks want to ensure that central bank money remains an anchor of monetary and financial stability.[4]There are numerous references made by central banks that CBDCs would reinforce central bank money as the anchor of the monetary system, as well as acting as an anchor of financial stability. For …Continue readingDesign choices for the successful rollout of any new product will always place the needs of end-users at the centre of solution development. Ultimately, CBDCs will only meet their broader policy and systemic objectives if users believe that their value improves on, and is superior to, existing market solutions and there is widespread adoption. To determine whether CBDCs ultimately meet their objectives will therefore require central banks to clearly articulate the economic or market problem that exists in today’s payment system, how the CBDC addresses or solves this problem and what “success” looks like. This should be based on use cases that are informed by market assessments of current and future payment needs. This means that user segments are clearly identified, the value-added benefits of the CBDC are clearly understood by all parties in the payments ecosystem and that existing payment infrastructure and technical know-how are leveraged to help rollout and delivery.However, as is the case for many CBDC initiatives around the world, the motivations expressed by central banks are predominantly focused on policy and systemic objectives, rather than being primarily driven by specific customer needs, requirements or benefits.Macroeconomic, financial policy and international considerations will likely fail to resonate with end-users who – particularly in highly advanced payments systems – already have fast, safe and efficient ways to make everyday payments. Paradoxically, if CBDCs are also overwhelmingly successful and achieve substantial adoption and usage, this may mean that they have displaced other types of payment instruments and deposit accounts, materializing the risks of disintermediation, deposit substitution and financial instability. In such a scenario, “success” may also mean that central bank money no longer acts as an anchor of monetary and financial stability, but rather becomes the cause of market disruption and instability.Currently, the design choices being explored for many retail CBDC projects replicate payment features and functionalities already offered by the private sector. They are based on the delivery of a means to hold and fund retail payments in CBDC (e.g., digital wallets), the infrastructure needed to enable those CBDC payments (e.g., online, point of sale and offline capabilities) and finally, a scheme (e.g., like the ones operated by domestic and international card networks and digital public infrastructure). While the underlying value being transferred with a CBDC is a central bank liability rather than a commercial bank liability, this distinction is largely inconsequential for the average consumer. The form factors needed will also be indistinguishable from current retail payment products.It will be critical therefore that the intended benefits of CBDCs over existing payment solutions in terms of their novel application be clearly articulated to users. To ensure its longer- term viability, central banks should also outline the incremental value that CBDCs create that exceed the significant costs associated with their development, delivery, and operation. Market participants will find it challenging to invest in new infrastructure unless there is a strong commercial business use case for doing so. Above all, CBDCs should avoid replicating market solutions in pursuit of domestic, geopolitical or macro-financial policy goals when highly advanced market solutions already exist. To do so could cause competitive distortions and inadvertently threaten the efficiencies that already exist in today’s highly evolved payments systems. It remains to be seen whether it is the role of the central bank to be direct providers of digital retail payments.Instead, central banks can ensure that central bank money remains a monetary anchor by “doing what only central banks can do”[5]In the House of Lords debate on the Economic Affairs Committee’s Report, Lord King of Lothbury cautioned against expanding the Bank of England’s responsibilities with a retail CBDC, noting that …Continue reading). Central banks are important regulators of payment systems and they are there to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial system. Central banks are pivotal for providing the necessary regulatory framework to foster safe innovation and supporting market innovation, e.g., in the nascent form of commercial bank tokenised deposits, which could play an important role in driving new payment solutions for the future digital money landscape (Oliver Wyman and JP Morgan, 2022). Importantly, tokenised central bank reserves in the form of wholesale CBDCs, together with tokenised deposits, would maintain the strong two-tier monetary system and provide the necessary monetary anchor to ensure the “singleness of money” in an evolving digital payments age (BIS, 2023).Delivering digital public money: the “two-tier” distribution model and interoperabilityCentral bank proposals for CBDCs recognise that digital innovation in payments is best served under a public-private partnership, which is critical to ensuring an open and competitive payment ecosystem. This approach is aligned with the existing allocation of public and private responsibilities within the financial system, and by extending a broader set of capabilities to the private sector, it would also provide a more robust platform for the development of value-added innovations. In the context therefore for CBDCs, a truly intermediated retail CBDC model could provide a secure, fast, and resilient technology environment that avoids the unnecessary expense of parallel infrastructure and ensures that compliance requirements remain primarily with industry. This approach also ensures that the central bank retains institutional governance over core monetary infrastructure, while relying on private sector competition to drive innovation, efficiency, and a diversity of offerings.Importantly, in a well-designed two-tier approach, intermediaries would continue to play a critical role in creating trust, meeting the needs of users, and enabling the successful adoption of a CBDC. As is the case for the current ecosystem, a two-tier model is based on the central bank issuing the currency and relying on market intermediaries to determine the modalities of distribution. These intermediaries then compete to attract customers through better and more efficient products and services and develop these based on market dynamics and commercial considerations. Therefore, if the CBDC intends to promote choice and competition in a two-tier model, the modalities of distribution and acceptance should be left to intermediaries and merchants and be based on market and commercial considerations rather than regulatory solutions.Intermediated models for distributing retail CBDCs nevertheless appear to fall short of such an arrangement in emerging retail CBDC proposals. Two-tier models, such as the ones that are being considered in Europe, require intermediaries to fulfil the role as distribution agents on behalf of the central bank, which are required to carry out these functions based on legislative mandates. This means that intermediaries do not necessarily exercise agency over whether they distribute and how they can offer CBDC products based on commercial considerations. Similarly, they will not be given the freedom to choose the means through which they would be able to distribute retail CBDCs. While interoperability is cited as a key objective for CBDCs, emerging proposals seem to indicate that they would need to be distributed using only central bank run-payment rails, operating separately under their own scheme.[6]See the Digital euro packagehttps://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/digital-euro-package_enA CBDC has the potential to serve as a foundation for innovative and value-added financial products and services developed by competitors within the private sector if there is agenuine desire for a CBDC to act as a digital version of central bank money. Open and competitive payment ecosystems are critical to enabling access, adoption, and use of payment options that serve a wide range of user needs, preferences, and financial inclusion. Moreover, ongoing payments innovation and the efficiency of national and international payment flows all depend on CBDCs being interoperable with existing payment schemes to ensure seamless consumer adoption, avoid siloed ecosystems and monetary fragmentation. For a CBDC, interoperability with other stores of value (e.g., commercial bank deposits, e-money etc.) would play an important role in strengthening the domestic payment ecosystem and reinforcing the role of central bank money at its core. Sustained collaboration between the central bank and private sector participants will be critical to delivering this interoperability.A CBDC must be usable for a variety of in-person and digital transactions to provide value as a payment mechanism. However, enabling acceptance points is a prominent challenge to driving mass adoption of any new payment solution. Consumers will be more likely to adopt a CBDC if it can be used on existing acceptance infrastructure and is supported by known and identifiable payment form factors (physical and remote) linked to the user’s existing devices and accounts. Requiring CBDCs to employ new payment rails would on the other hand create artificial barriers between the CBDC and commercial bank money, causing unnecessary friction between payment means and overcomplicate access and distribution. This would generate confusion and ultimately go against the ambition of an integrated payment market.Proposals that seek to mandate acceptance and impose regulatory models of distribution call into question a true two-tier model, which could result in unintended market fragmentation with implications for competition, stability, security, and innovation within the broader payment system. CBDCs will be more competitive, innovative, resilient, and better equipped to meet various policy objectives, as well as the evolving demands of the consumer, where the project works to actively encourage the participation of all payments market stakeholders. A ‘two-tier’ model that is based on market-led innovation is best placed to provide a secure, fast, and resilient technology environment that avoids the unnecessary expense of parallel infrastructure and ensures resilience.Ensuring a sustainable and competitive payment ecosystemMany central banks envisage CBDCs to operate functionally as a version of “digital cash”. This logic assumes that cash has characteristics that can be easily replicated by a digital equivalent. At a minimum, this means that users should have access to CBDCs at no additional cost, that it should be available at any time – with or without internet connectivity –, be accepted as a means to purchase goods and services and to be able to exchange it peer to peer. Importantly, it should also be available to everyone, to ensure inclusion and equity.However, unlike the relatively simple infrastructure that is needed to print and distribute cash, building new wallet solutions, integrating with new payment infrastructure, developing offline solutions, and enabling the various links in the payment value chain are all costly andcomplex activities. Sustainable digital payment ecosystems are dependent on a delicate balancing of incentives between those stakeholders who bear the costs of enabling payments and those who benefit from payment services. For a central bank’s CBDC infrastructure to sustain a vibrant and competitive ecosystem of payments innovators, incentives will need to exist that allow payment service providers to generate an appropriate return on their investments.Compensation models therefore need to consider the potentially significant new implementation and running costs that merchants and intermediaries will need to incur to offer CBDC services. These include, but not limited to, adapting front and backend systems, customer onboarding processes, operational and other security upgrades. Many central banks are also discussing the possibility that CBDCs could run on entirely new technology, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT). Others are also considering the need to adopt state-of-the- art privacy enhancing technologies, which are promising but have yet to be run and operated at scale. Accordingly, compensation models also need to factor in the feasibility for industry to adopt such new technologies. New teams of expertise would be needed with detailed knowledge of this new technology over the lifecycle of their development, leading to potentially high operational costs and excessive complexity for some payment intermediaries.Thought should also be given to how well existing regulation is equipped to address downstream applications of a CBDC via new technologies. Regulatory guidance in this area would be essential to help participants apply existing rules to innovative payment services involving a CBDC according to whatever technological form it is designed to function. For example, if parallel DLT infrastructure is required to support a CBDC that will function offline– consideration will need to be given to any additional regulatory requirements applicable to the use of this technology.Another key area of risk that is often given limited consideration is the enormous complexity and costs of mitigating fraud and cyber-risk across a retail CBDC ecosystem. The cost to the global economy of cybercrime is expected to grow by 15 percent per year over the next five years, reaching $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025.8 A retail CBDC will inevitably face sophisticated fraud and cyberattacks from both private and state-sponsored actors. CBDC users must trust that the system will be accessible and operational where and when it is needed; that their funds, accounts, identity, and other data are secure; and that they will be protected in the event of fraud.Importantly, unlike commercial means of payment, end users will hold the CBDC to a much higher standard given that it will be compared to its closest equivalent – the physical banknote. Users will also assume that as it is issued and backed by the central bank (often cited as the key benefit of a CBDC) it would be more secure than commercial alternatives. Should the CBDC therefore suffer from any vulnerability due to weak end-points, the underlying credibility of the CBDC and implicitly the central bank may be impacted as a result.The premise of CBDC innovation and scalability is built on the ability of intermediaries to offer consumers new digital services to enhance the convenience and utility of their CBDC accounts. If the cost to intermediaries and service providers for the provision of the CBDC is greater than a comparable digital means of payment, industry will not be incentivized to provide high-quality CBDC services, which may affect the success of the CBDC. The same competitive conditions should therefore be applied to CBDC and comparable payment services. Likewise, if central banks propose mandatory acceptance, intermediaries and merchants must not be constrained by regulated levels of compensation or, the payment rails through which they distribute and accept a CBDC. Instead, they should be given the choice to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective way to recuperate the costs being imposed as well as deliver commercially viable solutions to their customers.From a business perspective, while merchants are applauding CBDC initiatives in the hope of reduced costs, CBDCs risk disintermediating banks in the distribution of money and constraining existing private payment solutions. The risk of endangering competition and innovation due to excessive central bank’s intervention is high. This is why it is crucial to strike the right balance between public intervention and private sector initiative in regulating CBDCs. Above all, a CBDC should be financially self-sustaining, i.e., operate without any public subsidies on investment or operational costs. Otherwise, there is a risk that the CBDC will have the unintended consequences of reducing the diversity, competitiveness, and resilience in the payment landscape.Conclusion: principles for an open, competitive, and innovative payment market using CBDCsIt is essential that governments and central banks adopt specific measures to ensure an open, competitive, and innovative payment market using CBDCs. These actions should focus on creating a level-playing field for all payment solutions, encouraging private sector participation, and fostering technological advancements. By doing so, central banks can support a dynamic financial ecosystem where multiple payment methods coexist and compete, ultimately benefiting consumers through increased choice and improved services. By focusing on ensuring a well-functioning market, central banks can drive improvements in efficiency, innovation, and service quality to the benefit of consumers and thereby remaining an anchor for monetary and financial stability.While the motivations driving central banks to explore CBDCs differ, there remains a common set of principles that all CBDC initiatives should support. These tenets will best serve the needs of consumers, preserve the health of the financial system, and ensure that consumers continue to have access to a robust and innovative array of payment options (McWaters, 2024).Promote Mutual Trust and a Global Approach to Payments.Encouraging a global regulatory framework that supports multilateral initiatives ensures that sovereignty and geopolitical goals do not create barriers to competition and investment. Strengthening the elationship between jurisdictions is essential to prevent race-to-the-bottom scenarios where national champions are favored over foreign competition. This collaborative approach will uphold the commitment of advanced economies to an open free market economy. CBDCs should be designed to integrate with existing payment solutions, promoting unity rather than exclusion in the global payments landscape.Foster Genuine Public-Private Cooperation.Establishing open and ongoing dialogue between regulators and private market participants ensures that CBDC projects are aligned with market needs and have the best chance of success. Clearly delineating the roles and responsibilities of the central bank and private entities ensures that the central bank does not encroach on market activities that are more efficiently managed by private parties. Private sector innovation can be encouraged by avoiding overly prescriptive, top-down regulation that may stifle creativity and adaptability. This collaborative approach will leverage the strengths of both public and private sectors, fostering a dynamic and innovative payment ecosystem.Ensure a Level-Playing Field.Implementing regulations that allow CBDCs and private payment solutions to compete on fair terms will ensure a level playing field. This includes avoiding undue advantages for CBDCs from both a business and regulatory perspective. To achieve this the following guidelines should be followed:Mandatory acceptance.If CBDCs are granted mandatory acceptance by merchants, they would have a significant advantage over private payment solutions, which take years to scale up merchant acceptance. Careful consideration is needed to balance this.Market-Driven Compensation and Pricing.The compensation and pricing for CBDCs should be in line with the market (ie based on market analysis, established market impact assessments and pricing regulation) to ensure fairness. Above all, public subsidies should be avoided. The cornerstone of an open market economy is based on vibrant competition which drives better consumer outcomes.Regulatory Impartiality.As the issuer and regulator, the central bank should not exploit its privileged position to disadvantage competing payment methods. Regulatory measures must be impartial.Consistent Regulatory Standards.Apply the principle of “same activity, same risk, same regulation” to ensure that CBDCs are subject to the same regulatory requirements (e.g., oversight and AML checks) as private payment solutions.Create Interoperability:Designing CBDCs to integrate seamlessly with existing national and international payment systems is critical. This means relying on widely used standards and technologies to minimize costs and implementation burdens for intermediaries, service providers and merchants. Focusing on interoperability, rather than building a new infrastructure, would increase resilience and promote innovation by allowing the industry to build new services based on existing ones, thus reducing time-to-market. Ensuring compatibility with a wide array of solutions, including traditional banking, stablecoins, and potentially other CBDCs, is essential.By taking these positive actions, central banks, governments and legislators can create an environment where both CBDCs and private payment solutions thrive, driving competition, innovation, and improved financial services for all users. Partnerships between the public and private sectors will be key to successfully ushering in transformational change, drive adoption, and create the best end-user experience. Ongoing payments innovation, expanded financial inclusion, and the efficiency of national and international payment flows all depend on vibrant private sector competition. If a CBDC is the right path for a central bank to reach its objectives, the private sector can help central banks bring their vision to life and realize their goals.ReferencesMcWaters, J., Wann, J., Baert, C., De Matteis, A., and Cuccuru, P.

The Rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies: A New Era in FinanceIn the rapidly evolving world of finance, **central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)** are emerging as a transformative force. A **CBDC** is a digital representation of a nation’s fiat currency, issued and regulated by its central bank. Unlike the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, **CBDCs** aim to maintain a stable value tied directly to the country’s existing currency.Countries around the globe, from theBahamasto China, are actively exploring or have already initiated **CBDC projects**. The primary objective is to enhance financial inclusion, offering secure and efficient payment options for those without access to traditional banking systems.

Despite numerous economic pressures, home prices remain steadfast, a phenomenon senior editor-at-large Shawn Tully likened to “defying gravity.”Commercial Real Estate in CrisisThe conversation shifted between the residential and commercial sectors, withJulie Ingersoll, fromCBRE Investment Management, highlighting the vulnerabilities faced bycommercial real estate. The sector grapples with higher interest rates and dwindling demand, particularly in office spaces. Ingersoll noted the alarming office vacancy rate, which has soared to 18% and may soon reach 20%.The NIMBY ChallengeThe dialogue also addressed the historic inventory crisis exacerbated byNIMBYism—”not in my backyard” attitudes that hinder housing development. Ingersoll pointed to California’s struggles, where policy failures and community resistance continue to stifle housing supply despite recent legislative efforts to ease building constraints.The Remote Work RevolutionRemote work‘s enduring impact on real estate was another focal point. Sean Dobson, ofAmherst Group, discussed how remote work has reshaped the sector, contributing to the pandemic housing boom and altering office dynamics. He predicted that hybrid work models are here to stay, challenging traditional commuting cultures.Converting Commercial to ResidentialIngersoll proposed converting underutilized commercial properties into residential spaces as a potential solution to thehousing shortage.

However, many cities are increasingly looking tozoning reformas a pivotal strategy to boost housing supply. AsUrban Land Magazinereports, the severity of the crisis has pushed it to the forefront of political agendas, making politicians more inclined to tackle the issue.City planner M. Nolan Gray, author ofArbitrary Lines: How Zoning Broke the American City and How to Fix It, highlights the shift in urban policies. “Dozens of cities have scrapped exclusionary single-family home zoning and parking requirements, which was previously inconceivable,” Gray notes.The Shift Towards Inclusive ZoningDavid Garcia, policy director for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, underscores the growing openness tozoning changes. “Many jurisdictions are reluctant to usezoning reformdue to backlash, but the idea of allowing multiple units on single-family parcels is gaining traction,” Garcia explains.Despite the momentum, the impact of recentzoning changesis still unfolding. Garcia warns that piecemeal reforms may not achieve the desired outcomes, and comprehensivezoning changesare often challenging to implement.According to Toccarra Nicole Thomas, director of land use and development at Smart Growth America,zoninghas historically contributed to the crisis by focusing on low-density, auto-centric housing. “Zoning is inherently inflexible,” Thomas asserts. She advocates for comprehensive reform to effectively generateaffordable housing.Strategies for Effective Zoning ReformGray suggests that allowing “by right” building permits could significantly streamline the development process. Other recommendedzoning reformsinclude reducing lot size requirements, eliminating parking restrictions, and allowing manufactured housing.Reducing lot size requirementsEliminating parking restrictionsAllowing manufactured housingSeveral cities have successfully implementedzoning reforms. In Oakland, California, the transformation of Auto Row into a residential hub is a prime example. Similarly, Washington, D.C., has seen the revitalization of former industrial areas like the Navy Yard and NoMa into vibrant mixed-use communities.Political Challenges and OpportunitiesZoning reformis not without its political challenges. Thomas points out that reform efforts often face opposition from NIMBYs (Not In My Backyard) and BANANAs (Building Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything). However, engaging with community stakeholders and building coalitions can help overcome resistance.Garcia advises developers to engage with communities early in the planning process to demonstrate the benefits of new housing developments. “Data showing that new housing can increase the value of existing homes can be persuasive,” he says.Ultimately,zoning reformis a gradual process. As Gray emphasizes, “We’re rolling back 100 years of policy that made it nearly impossible to build housing in dense cities, so it will take time to fix.” Yet, progress is being made, and the potential for transformative change is on the horizon.For further insights, explore theReshaping the City: Zoning for a More Equitable, Resilient, and Sustainable Futurereport and the accompanyingwebinar, featuring experts like Nolan Gray and Toccarra Nicole Thomas.“`Read More1410, 2024Florida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesGalleryFlorida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesArticle,Economics,EnvironmentFlorida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T23:49:32-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Economics,Environment|Tags:Natural Disasters,Politics|0 CommentsFlorida Faces Daunting Recovery After Dual Hurricane AssaultAsHurricane Miltongathered strength in the south-western Gulf of Mexico,Floridabraced itself for a second blow in as many weeks. The state, still nursing wounds from the recent wrath ofHurricane Helene, found itself once again in the crosshairs of nature’s fury.The impact of these consecutive storms has been nothing short of catastrophic. While major urban centers likeTampaandSt Petersburgnarrowly avoided the worst, other regions along the Gulf coast were not as fortunate. The devastation has been unprecedented, withdestruction sweepingthrough communities, leaving a trail of ruin in its wake.The human toll is staggering: approximately250 lives lost, countless homes destroyed, and millions left without power. The financial cost is equally severe, with early estimates placing the damage fromHurricane Miltonalone at$160 billion to $180 billion. When combined with the losses fromHurricane Helene, Florida is facing a financial hit nearinghalf a trillion dollars, a figure that threatens to erase expected economic growth for the coming quarters.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, addressing the situation, noted the resilience required to recover from such disasters. “We did not get the worst-case scenario, but we did get hit,” he said, emphasizing the long road to recovery ahead. The state’s experience as themost hurricane-proneregion in the nation underscores the challenges that lie ahead.Even as rescue operations continue, the broader implications of these storms are becoming apparent. Theelectoral process, already under strain fromHurricane Helene, faces further disruption. Efforts are underway to ensure voting can proceed smoothly, with measures in place to accommodate displaced residents and affected polling sites.Beyond immediate concerns, the hurricanes’ impact on Florida’sreal estateandinsurance marketscould be profound. Theinsurance crisisin particular, exacerbated by these events, demands urgent attention. Experts believe these storms could finally prompt legislative action to address systemic issues in the market.Despite the challenges, the allure of Florida remains strong. The state has historically seen economic growth following hurricanes, and the influx of new residents is unlikely to slow significantly. AsKen Johnsonfrom the University of Mississippi notes, “There’s momentum for business capital to come in, and folks do still want to retire to Florida.”ConclusionFlorida stands at a crossroads, grappling with the immediate aftermath of two devastating hurricanes while looking ahead to a complex recovery. The resilience of its people and the state’s ability to adapt will be crucial in navigating the challenges ahead.Read More1410, 2024The Housing Dilemma in Steamboat SpringsGalleryThe Housing Dilemma in Steamboat SpringsArticle,Community Development,Real EstateThe Housing Dilemma in Steamboat SpringsByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T22:49:05-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Community Development,Real Estate|Tags:Housing,Local Politics|0 CommentsThe Housing Dilemma in Steamboat SpringsIn the picturesque town ofSteamboat Springs, Colorado, a fierce debate is underway over a proposed housing development known asBrown Ranch. This once-affordable“cowboy ski town”is grappling with skyrocketing real estate prices that have left even high-income professionals struggling to find homes.Rising Real Estate ChallengesSince the pandemic,Steamboat Springshas seen single-family home prices soar by about 80% to an average of $1.8 million. The surge has put homeownership out of reach for many, with property taxes also escalating by 86%. Local realtors report that competition is so intense that those without all-cash offers are often sidelined.Read more about the housing crisis.Brown Ranch: A Divisive ProposalTheYampa Valley Housing Authority’s Brown Ranch projecthas ignited a community-wide debate. Proponents argue that the development is essential for providingaffordable housing. However, opponents, led by longtime resident Jim Engelken, voice concerns about its scale and impact on local infrastructure. Engelken, who has lived in Steamboat since 1979, believes the project is“too big, too much, and too expensive.”“Yes, we need affordable housing, no question,”Engelken said.“It needs to be smaller to start with, it needs to have some ability to generate its own way, its own money.”Despite these concerns, the city council approved the project, but opposition efforts have led to a ballot measure that will let voters decide its fate in March.Broader Trends in Mountain TownsSteamboat Springsis not alone in this struggle. Other mountain and resort towns likeDriggs, Idaho, andWoodstock, New York, have experienced similar real estate booms. In Driggs, home prices have risen around 80% since the pandemic, while Woodstock has seen a 78% increase. The influx of buyers seeking more affordable alternatives to high-profile destinations has exacerbated these issues.Explore Driggs home pricesandWoodstock prices.Community Identity at StakeSteamboat’s identityas a small-town Western haven is at risk. The town, once known for its affordability compared to places like Vail, is now facing a real estate crisis. City Manager Gary Suiter notes that the town’s authentic charm is being challenged by these rapid changes.As the debate overBrown Ranchcontinues, the community must weigh the need for affordable housing against the preservation of its unique character.

A recent analysis byEconofacthighlights the growing burden ofhousing costson American households. With median house prices now six times the median income—up from four to five times two decades ago—the dream ofhomeownershipis slipping away for many. Even renters, who have historically found refuge in more affordable options, are feeling the pinch as the ratio ofmedian rentsto median income has crept from 25% to 30%.The Facts Behind the CrisisWorsening Affordability:Theaffordability crisisis not confined to coastal cities like San Francisco and New York. It is a nationwide issue, affecting both urban and rural areas.Cost-Burdened Households:A significant increase incost-burdened renters—those spending more than 30% of their income on housing—has been observed, particularly among those earning between $35,000 and $49,000 annually.Geographic Variations:Traditionally affordable regions are seeing rapid price appreciation, shrinking the affordability gap with historically expensive areas.The issue ofhousing affordabilityis compounded by a mix of demographic shifts and regulatory hurdles. The aging population, with more seniors opting toage in place, has contributed to a supply crunch. Meanwhile, zoning laws and other regulatory restrictions limit housing density, exacerbating the shortage. These factors, coupled with therise in mortgage ratesfrom 3.5% to nearly 8% since early 2022, have made the path tohomeownershipeven steeper.Hope on the Horizon?Despite the grim outlook, there are glimmers of hope. The anticipated reversal of the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle couldlower mortgage rates, easing the financial strain on households. Additionally, there are signs of change in urban zoning laws to allow more affordable housing construction. A surge inmultifamily housing startsand a large pipeline of apartments under construction may help relieve pressure on rents.The complexity of thehousing affordability crisissuggests there is no quick fix.

Asremote workbecame the norm,office vacancy ratessoared to unprecedented levels, leaving many urban centers with empty office buildings. This shift has sparked a new trend: converting vacant office spaces into housing.According to areportfrom theCenter for American Progress, the United States is currently short 3.8 million housing units, and the adaptive reuse of office buildings is seen as a potential solution to this crisis. The report highlights that theBiden-Harris administrationsupports these conversions as a means to increase the housing supply while addressing the financial woes of commercial real estate owners.Challenges and OpportunitiesWhile converting office space into residential units offers potential benefits, it is not without challenges. The report emphasizes thatfinancing,building layout, andmarket conditionsare significant hurdles. Office buildings, especially those classified as Class B and C, often feature designs that are not conducive to residential use, lacking natural light and adequate plumbing for multiple units.Despite these challenges, there are notable examples of successful conversions. Cities likeLos AngelesandAlexandria, Virginia, have led the way in transforming office spaces into housing units. These cities have leveragedgovernment incentivesand streamlined zoning regulations to facilitate the conversions.Government InitiativesState and local governments are increasingly offering incentives to encourage office-to-housing conversions. For instance,Californiahas allocated $400 million for such projects, whileWisconsinhas introduced interest-free loans to support developers. These initiatives aim to address the affordable housing shortage and revitalize urban centers.At the federal level, theBiden-Harris administrationhas released a guidebook outlining programs to support these conversions. The administration is focused on ensuring that new residential properties are not only affordable but also energy-efficient, aligning with broader climate goals.RecommendationsTheCenter for American Progressreport offers several recommendations to enhance the feasibility of office-to-housing conversions. It suggests integrating these projects into mixed-use development plans, utilizing climate-focused financial resources, and exploring all viable options to increase the overall housing supply. These strategies aim to create vibrant, sustainable urban environments that meet the housing needs of the population.As cities continue to grapple with the dual challenges of office vacancies and housing shortages, the conversion of office spaces into residential units presents a promising opportunity.

With over 45 million U.S. households renting, many face severe financial strains due to high rental costs. TheCenter for American Progress’s reportdelves into potential solutions through local land-use reforms aimed at alleviating these pressures.The study reveals daunting statistics—nearly 11.2 million households spend over half their income on rent. This housing cost burden signals an urgent need for comprehensive strategies to ease financial pressures on renters and potential homeowners alike. The current housing market challenges, driven by historical zoning ordinances that limit affordable options, point to a reform path that could significantly alter the landscape.Local Land Use Reform as a Key SolutionThe push for reformingzoning lawsfocuses on expanding the supply of affordable housing by revisiting and updating restrictive local policies. Traditional zoning practices have long favored single-family homes, inadvertently fostering exclusion and driving up housing costs. By transitioning to more inclusive zoning codes, communities can potentially unlock a diverse range of housing solutions—without the reliance on federal or state subsidies.Federal Initiatives and Grassroots MovementsThe federal government’s proposed Building Opportunity program could be pivotal, offering financial incentives to jurisdictions that commit to significant zoning reforms. These reforms promise to open high-frequency transit corridors and urban areas to a variety of housing types, thus promoting greater accessibility and affordability.Cities like Minneapolis and states including Florida have already spearheaded initiatives to reduce zoning constraints, signaling a promising trend towards more affordable urban living solutions. The city eliminated parking mandates and expanded zoning to allow multifamily units, significantly transforming its housing landscape.Conclusion: A Path ForwardThis surge in regulatory reform is gaining momentum, evidenced by grassroots actions and the backing of federal incentives. As local governments begin dismantling barriers to affordable housing, the vision of a more inclusive and economically vibrant urban future becomes increasingly attainable.The ongoing conversation highlights the vital role of reforms in realizing equitable growth and alleviating the housing crisis that has gripped communities nationwide. As the Center for American Progress notes, these initiatives not only build opportunity but also play a central role in mitigating deep-rooted inequalities in housing availability and affordability.For more insights, read the full article onBuilding Opportunity: Expanding Housing in America by Reforming Local Land Use.—Read More1410, 2024How Blockchain is Revolutionizing Real Estate TransactionsGalleryHow Blockchain is Revolutionizing Real Estate TransactionsArticle,Blockchain Technology,Real EstateHow Blockchain is Revolutionizing Real Estate TransactionsByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T17:49:21-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Blockchain Technology,Real Estate|Tags:Security,Transparency|0 CommentsBlockchain technology is set to revolutionize thereal estate industry, bringing unprecedented levels ofsecurityandtransparencyto property transactions.

Withcyber incidentson the rise and associated business costssoaring, many experts view it as indispensable. The globalcyber insurance marketis projected to reach a staggering $90.6 billion by 2033, underscoring its escalating relevance.Challenges in CurrentCyber Insurance PoliciesDespite its necessity, many organizations find that theircyber insurance policiesare not working effectively. According to a 2023 Delinea report, there is a growing disconnect between carriers and enterprises, leading to numerous claims beingrejected. This issue is particularly prevalent among small businesses, which face an increase incyberattacksyet often remain uncertain about their coverage details.A striking example comes from a 2022 report by the UK’s Federation of Small Businesses, revealing that 38% of its members withcyber insurancedo not know what their policy includes. Furthermore, a recent study by Aviva found that only 17% of small businesses havecyber insurance, illustrating the widespread skepticism and lack of adoption in the sector.Barriers to Effective CoverageOne of the primary barriers to effectivecyber insurance coverageis the complexity and ambiguity of policy terms. Tarnveer Singh, CISO of The Exeter, highlighted that this can lead to disputes and delays duringcyber incidents, exacerbating stress and financial strain for policyholders. The evolving nature ofcyber threatsadds another layer of complexity, often resulting in inadequate or overpriced policies.Additionally, the growing cost of premiums, projected to increas...

IntroductionThe world is moving rapidly toward a digital future, raising questions and challenges for central banks. Digital technologies have advanced faster than any innovation in human history (Figures 1and2), and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this pace (Abidi, El-Herradi, and Sakha 2023). To keep up with this trend and harness its significant economic benefits, governments are adopting digitalization strategies to transform public services and increase their efficiency.1With payments becoming increasingly digitalized, one question is whether a structural shift from a reliance on cash to digital currencies could materialize. Many central banks are reflecting on how to achieve their policy objectives in this changing landscape. One option to preserve the key role of central bank-issued money in a digital world is to adopt a central bank digital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is a digital liability of the central bank used as a means of payment by the population (retail) or financial institutions (wholesale).View Full SizeFigure 1.Digital Ecosystems in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: International Telecommunication Union; and IMF staff calculations.Note: AE = advanced economy; CCA = Caucasus and Central Asia; EM = emerging market; GCC = Gulf Cooperation Council; ME&CA = Middle East and Central Asia; MENA = Middle East and North Africa; OE = oil exporter; Ol= oil importer.Download FigureDownload figure as PowerPoint slideAs of October 2023, 130 countries, representing 98 percent of global GDP, were exploring the potential use of a CBDC (Kosse and Mattei 2022).2,3A survey of IMF country teams representing 31 Middle East and Central Asia (ME&CA) economies4finds that 19 countries are considering or exploring a CBDC. This is consistent with information from country authorities’ public statements (Figure 3). Most ME&CA countries interested in a CBDC are at the research stage, while a few are at the proof-of-concept5stage (Bahrain, Georgia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates). Kazakhstan is most advanced in its journey to CBDC, having initiated two pilots of the digital tenge (DT; NBK 2021;Handagama 2023). The region’s fragile and conflict-affected states (FCSs) and low-income countries (LICs) have expressed limited interest. Three country case studies (Jordan, Kazakhstan, Libya), each at different stages of CBDC exploration, can be found in Annex 4.View Full SizeFigure 2.Broadband Ecosystem in ME&CA(Per 100 inhabitants)Citation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: International Telecommunication Union; and IMF staff calculations.Note: “Fixed broadband subscriptions” refers to fixed subscriptions to high-speed access to the public internet (a TCP/IP connection) at downstream speeds equal to or greater than 256 kbits per second. “Active mobile broadband subscriptions” refers to the sum of active handset-based and computer-based (USB/dongles) mobile broadband subscriptions that allow access to the internet.

The survey indicates that most ME&CA countries, especially those interested in financial inclusion (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic), are primarily interested in retail CBDCs. Hence, this paper will focus on retail CBDCs. A few countries are exploring wholesale CBDCs with local commercial banks and fintech partners (Saudi Arabia).6The key questions policymakers need to consider when exploring possible CBDC adoption are the following: What objectives do policymakers aim to achieve with a CBDC? Which inefficiencies in payment systems can CBDCs address? What are the implications of CBDC issuance for financial stability, monetary policy pass-through, and central bank operational risk? How can CBDC design help achieve policy objectives and mitigate these risks?Although there are no clear economic prerequisites to adopting a CBDC, the choice to issue a CBDC is complex and country dependent. Each country has different objectives, payment and financial systems, legal and regulatory frameworks, and central bank capacity. CBDCs are also a relatively new concept, with limited adoption and uptake to date, making it challenging to draw lessons from other countries. Hence, policymakers should approach CBDCs cautiously: successful implementation will require comprehensive analysis. In this respect, the IMF has been helping country authorities evaluate the need to issue a CBDC and establish strong policies and regulatory frameworks through capacity development. As of February 2023, seven ME&CA countries had received IMF capacity development on CBDC. In addition, the institution is leading the way with a significant number of analytical pieces,7including a comprehensive CBDC handbook guided by specific country capacity development questions on CBDC-related topics (IMF 2023b) (Box 1).Box 1.Capacity Development on Central Bank Digital CurrenciesThe IMF’s Digital Money Strategy, which the Executive Board endorsed in July 2021, gives the institution a mandate to help ensure that digital money fosters domestic and international economic and financial stability (IMF 2021a). The IMF has increased its analytical work and capacity development delivery on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The objective is to strengthen the capacity of member countries to assess, design, pilot, implement, and supervise CBDCs. Ultimately, both analytical work and capacity development delivery will contribute to country economic and financial stability and the stability of the international monetary system by making country payment systems and macrofinancial frameworks more resilient.In terms of analytical work, theIMF (2023d)released five chapters of theCBDC Virtual Handbookin November 2023. This handbook is a guide that aims to gather lessons learned and develop frameworks and guidance for member countries. It is meant to be a reference for policymakers and experts at central banks and finance ministries. This major project will generate about 20 chapters over the next five years, with four to five chapters being released per year. The chapter topics are chosen based on country needs and feasibility. The first set of chapters included a decision-making framework, a product development methodology, and implications for financial inclusion, monetary policy transmission, and capital flow management measures. The chapters will be updated regularly to reflect the latest developments and policies related to CBDCs. A second set of chapters will be published in 2024. Potential topics include financial stability; CBDC distribution, incentives, and adoption; cyber security; the relationship between CBDCs and other payment systems; cross-border payments; and implications for data frameworks and privacy protection.Regarding capacity development, the IMF works with countries through bilateral capacity development and regional workshops. The bilateral capacity development aims to provide tailored, practical, innovative, and technical advice to countries based on solid and thorough analysis and lessons learned from other countries. After capacity development delivery, countries should be better equipped to (1) understand the different uses, designs, ecosystem, and advantages and disadvantages of CBDCs; (2) understand the capacity, processes, and cost requirements involved in exploring and implementing CBDCs; (3) evaluate whether CBDCs are suitable for their economies given their specific goals, challenges, capacities, and the nature of their payment and financial sectors; (4) plan and test different stages of CBDC exploration, including creating prototypes and conducting trials to test specific policies; (5) design policies, such as regulations, to accompany CBDCs and promote financial inclusion and integrity; and (6) understand and prepare for any potential effects that their CBDC or a CBDC from another country may have on their economy. More than 30 bilateral capacity development and regional workshops have taken place, with a quarter of them focusing on Middle East and Central Asia countries. In June 2023, the IMF and Morocco co-hosted a high-level policy discussion on CBDCs to share knowledge and information among Middle East and Central Asia countries.The IMF has been actively participating in international working groups within the Group of Twenty and the Group of Seven to study how CBDCs can be used for cross-border transfers. They are exploring new ways to improve cross-border payments by analyzing innovative solutions, such as multilateral platforms, that use innovative technology to connect payments between countries using CBDCs and traditional payment systems. The IMF and World Bank have developed an approach to provide technical assistance for cross-border payments. The IMF has identified specific areas where assistance can be most effective in achieving the goals outlined in the Group of Twenty Roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments while safeguarding the integrity of the financial system.2. CBDC ObjectivesWhat objectives do policymakers hope to achieve by adopting a CBDC? Country authorities have multifaceted reasons for exploring the adoption of CBDCs (see Annex 3 for a complete list debated in the literature). The survey of IMF ME&CA country teams identifies enhancingfinancial inclusionandpayment system efficiencyas the top priorities for exploring CBDCs in the ME&CA region (Table 1).8In Middle East and North Africa (MENA) oil exporters and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the motivation for exploring CBDCs is to make payments more efficient, both domestically and cross-border (for example, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) (Schickler 2022; Central Bank of United Arab Emirates 2023). In contrast, the top priority in Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) countries is to increase financial inclusion; improving payment system efficiency and promoting innovation in financial technology are also important objectives in this region. In Georgia, where the focus is on a CBDC’s potential to promote financial inclusion, the central bank has been actively researching CBDC capabilities, design, and potential use cases since 2020 and officially launched a limited access live pilot of the digital lari with Ripple Labs through the cutting-edge Ripple CBDC platform (National Bank of Georgia 2023). MENA oil importers (for example, Jordan) also rank promoting financial inclusion and the efficiency of payment systems as key motivations for exploring CBDCs (IMF 2022d).Several lower-middle-income countries have built national agendas focused on deepening financial inclusion. In June 2021, Uzbekistan’s first National Financial Inclusion Strategy (for 2021–23) identified promoting digital payments as a key priority. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan is also promoting digital banking and payments, revising and approving regulation that expands access to remote banking and provides for bank accounts to be opened remotely using digital identification (EBRD 2023).Table 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupSource: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.Table 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupCountry GroupMaking Payments More Efficient (cross-border)Making Payments More Efficient (domestic)Broadening Access to PaymentsIncreasing Financial InclusionMENA Oil Exporters✓✓MENA Oil Importers✓✓Caucasus and Central Asia✓✓Low-Income Countries✓Gulf Cooperation Council Countries✓✓Fragile and Conflict-Affected States✓✓Emerging Markets✓✓Source: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.View TableTable 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupCountry GroupMaking Payments More Efficient (cross-border)Making Payments More Efficient (domestic)Broadening Access to PaymentsIncreasing Financial InclusionMENA Oil Exporters✓✓MENA Oil Importers✓✓Caucasus and Central Asia✓✓Low-Income Countries✓Gulf Cooperation Council Countries✓✓Fragile and Conflict-Affected States✓✓Emerging Markets✓✓Source: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.3. Payment Systems and Benefits of CBDC in ME&CAUnderstanding payment systems and their inherent inefficiencies in the region will help ascertain the potential benefits of CBDCs and, specifically, whether CBDCs can help achieve the objectives of ME&CA policymakers to enhance financial inclusion and the efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems.A. Financial Inclusion and Payment Systems in ME&CAIn general, there is a low level of financial inclusion in ME&CA countries, though there is a marked divergence across the region. For example, access to bank accounts in ME&CA countries is lower than the global average, indicating a low level of financial inclusion (Figure 4, panel 1) (Cardarelli, Vera-Martin, and Lall 2022,Blancher and others, 2019). However, access to bank accounts is relatively higher in the GCC, while low-income Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP) countries have the lowest access. The percentage of the adult population with bank accounts ranges from 6 percent in Sudan to 90 percent in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Figure 4, panel 2). Access to bank accounts appears to correlate with countries’ income levels but remains well below the global average.Similarly, although the adoption of digital payment methods in ME&CA countries is progressing, there is considerable variation, and the region overall is behind other regions (Figure 5).9This heterogeneity in digital payment adoption could be attributed to several factors. The impact of the pandemic and the need for economic diversification have driven an increase in digital payments in the GCC countries (Economist Intelligence Unit 2020). Saudi Arabia has the fastest digital payments adoption rate thanks to a comprehensive digital payment strategy under its Vision 2030 development plan.10Within the MENA region, there is a wide discrepancy in the adoption of digital payments. Countries like the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have high levels of digital payment usage, with 85 percent, 73 percent, and 77 percent of adults utilizing digital payments in 2021, respectively. In contrast, countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have significantly lower adoption rates at 14 percent and 8 percent, respectively. This disparity in adoption rates may reflect the high cost of existing digital payment systems in some countries, which can exclude certain segments of the population. In the CCA, Kazakhstan is making significant progress in increasing digital payments, with the amount of non-cash payments increasing by 2.5 times in 2021 compared to 2019 (PwC 2023).Despite having a digitally savvy population, some ME&CA countries still heavily rely on cash for transac-tions.11Cash in circulation is particularly high in the region’s LICs and FCSs (Figure 6). For example, in Iraq and Mauritania, cash in circulation was about 26 percent of GDP in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In contrast, cash in circulation has been declining in the GCC, averaging only 5.4 percent of GDP in 2021, reflecting the region’s digital advancement.View Full SizeFigure 4.Account Ownership, 2021(Percent of adults over age 15)Citation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Global Financial Inclusion database 2021;and IMF staff calculations.Note: Data labels in the figure use International Organization for Standardization (ISO) country codes.

The region’s informal sector plays a substantial role in the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and employing about 65 percent of the labor force. Only about one-third of retail transactions are conducted electronically in the region. This high reliance on cash is also due to tax and loan debt evasion, concealment of the intended use of money, underbanked consumer and merchant segments, a cultural bias toward cash, low wealth, and lack of trust in financial institutions (Figure 7) (Abidi and others 2023;Gatti and others 2014;Chan and others 2021).View Full SizeFigure 6.Reliance on Cash in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Haver Analytics; ILOSTAT database; national authorities; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Cash ratios are computed as currency in circulation divided by nominal GDP.

Remittance flows to ME&CA countries reached $447 billion in 2021, dwarfng other high-volume flows such as portfolio investment and official development assistance. However, the most common way to send and receive domestic remittances is still by another person using cash (Figure 8, panel 2).12The opposite is true in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, where account-based remittance transfers are most common, followed by those from money transfer operators. Cost does not seem to be a key impediment since the cost of remittances across all corridors and providers from the MENA region to receiving countries is below the global and sub-Saharan Africa averages (Figure 8, panels 3 and 4).View Full SizeFigure 8.Remittances in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: IMF, Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics database; World Bank, Remittance Prices Worldwide; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Sent or received domestic remittances: using an account (percent age 15+).

Benefits of CBDCs in ME&CACBDCs can help policymakers achieve their primary objectives of enhancing financial inclusion and payment system efficiency (domestic and cross-border) if they can address the inherent gaps in current systems.Financial InclusionCBDCs have the potential to advance financial inclusion by creating more competition for consumers and allowing for transactions to be settled more directly through reduced intermediation, thereby lowering the cost of financial services and making them more accessible. Unlike commercial banks, the lack of a profit motive by the central bank can also help keep costs lower. Considering that the financial system in the ME&CA region is heavily bank-dominated with a relatively high profit margin, CBDCs have the potential to advance financial inclusion.CBDCs could also help enhance the service quality for payment service providers (PSPs) and spur further innovation in the digital payment system by simplifying market entry for PSPs and removing the need for negotiations to access specific payment infrastructures and banking services. Similar effects could be achieved through policy reforms that enable nonbank entities to access central bank accounts and provide risk-based, fair, and transparent access to critical payment infrastructures, as seen in the case of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, given that a CBDC would carry the safety of central bank money and legal tender status, it could help overcome distrust in financial services and broaden access. CBDCs could also provide the needed technological infrastructure from scratch (a “clean slate”) if it does not already exist; hence, providing a public good that may be particularly relevant for LICs and FCSs, which may lack such infrastructure and where the share of the underserved population is particularly high.Payment SystemsCBDCs have the potential to help improve the efficiency of payment systems, both domestic and cross-border. By spurring competition in the domestic payment market, CBDCs can lower costs and update legacy technology platforms. As for cross-border payment systems, these are prone to various frictions, such as fragmented and truncated data formats across regions, complex processing of compliance checks, limited operating hours across jurisdictions, lack of payment system interoperability (due to differences in domestic legislation), and legacy technology platforms. These frictions result in high fees due to multiple intermediaries (correspondent banking) and a lack of guarantee as to whether the funds have been received in full (that is, finality). CBDCs could simplify the intermediation chains and increase availability (as they would operate on a 24/7 basis) by starting a “clean slate” system designed to achieve interoperability between different jurisdictions and allowing for real-time payment service (BIS, IMF, and World Bank 2021). The United Arab Emirates’ mBridge project is a good example for aiming to resolve these inefficiencies with wholesale CBDCs.By improving the efficiency of cross-border payments, CBDCs could also enable the flow of international remittances. This, in turn, can play an essential role in supporting economic development and financial inclusion.13CCA and MENA oil-importing economies, considering their high reliance on cash, including for remittances, could reap significant gains from improving the efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems. Cheaper and more accessible remittances will benefit senders and recipients, help buffer economic shocks, and stimulate growth.Despite the potential of CBDCs to improve financial inclusion and improve payments systems efficiency, it is crucial to recognize that CBDCs are not a panacea. Therefore, policymakers should conduct a comprehensive analysis of the various alternatives as some of the benefits of CBDCs could be achieved through other means. For example, facilitating the entry of new players in the market and providing comprehensive regulation and supervision of the entities to uphold the stability and integrity of the payment system can also improve competition. Increased competition could also occur through improved access to central bank accounts by PSPs, to avoid intermediaries in payment services provision.CBDCs may also not be able to overcome existing barriers to financial inclusion, such as those due to limited identification and financial literacy, low wealth, and high informality, which tend to be associated with a strong preference for physical cash. Regarding cross-border payments, some regional initiatives are already addressing inefficiencies by fostering payment system interoperability. Specifically, the GCC Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and the Arab Regional Payment System aim to streamline intraregional payment flows and improve the cross-border payment ecosystem (Box 2). In addition, CBDCs could coexist with other payment systems already in place and are not an either/or solution.Box 2.Improving Cross-Border Payment SystemsGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS)Led by the six central banks of the GCC (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates)What will it do?The GCC RTGS will provide an overarching regional payment system connecting the individual domestic RTGS payment systems of each of the six GCC countries, enabling an efficient delivery of intra-GCC payments in the fiat currencies of the six countries. For example, a Saudi riyal payment originated in the United Arab Emirates and destined for a beneficiary in Saudi Arabia would occur over the domestic United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabian payment systems, instead of relying on bilateral correspondent banking frameworks.What are the benefits?The GCC RTGS would create standardization, drive efficiency, bring predictability, and reduce costs, as cross-border payments would previously be delivered using domestic payment system architecture. This would bring the experience of a pan-regional cross-border payment closer to that of a domestic payment.Arab Regional Payment System (known as BUNA)Led by the Arab Monetary FundWhat will it do?The system aims to create a central routing agent to provide a standardized payment experience across the Arab countries. With a common set of operating rules and a standardized SWIFT platform, BUNA would bring together the markets of the GCC and the Middle East and North Africa for all intraregional payments, covering not just the fiat currencies of the Arab countries but also key principally traded currencies such as the US dollar and euro.What are the benefits?Already “live” with the Emirati dirham, Egyptian pound, and Saudi Arabian riyal, BUNA is looking to augment currencies, countries, and commercial bank participation over the near to medium term to provide efficiency and standardization to intraregional cross-border payments. Soon, BUNA aims to enhance the platform further by introducing instant and real-time delivery of pan-regional cross-border payments and providing the foundation to support other financial market infrastructure.Sources: Arab Monetary Fund; andChan and others (2021).4. Financial Systems and Financial Stability Implications of CBDCs in ME&CAUnderstanding ME&CA financial systems will help to ascertain how CBDCs may affect financial stability in the ME&CA region. The relatively healthy financial systems in the region could support CBDC adoption. However, a country-specific analysis is paramount, including given the heterogeneity of financial systems across the region.A. ME&CA Financial SystemsME&CA financial systems are primarily dominated by banks (Figure 9). Nonbank financial institutions— pension funds, asset management and finance companies, and insurance—are underdeveloped in the region and are generally not involved in credit intermediation. Banks’ total assets reached $2.4 trillion in 2021 (185 percent of GDP), up from $1.7 trillion in 2016 (149 percent of GDP).14,15Still, there is significant heterogeneity across the region.In the GCC, financial systems are large, having grown in recent years thanks to buoyant economic activity fueled by large hydrocarbon proceeds and abundant liquidity. At the end of 2021, banks’ lending to GDP reached $2.7 trillion (or 198 percent of non-oil GDP) compared to other emerging markets (44 percent of GDP). Bahrain (the smallest GCC economy) ranks first in terms of banking system size with a ratio of banking system assets to non-oil GDP of 552 percent, while Saudi Arabia (by far the largest economy in the region) has the smallest ratio of banking system assets to non-oil GDP of 100 percent.Financial sectors in the CCA region are relatively small and underdeveloped. Georgia has the largest banking sector in the region and is close to the global average of emerging markets, as measured by banking system assets to GDP. In contrast, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan have relatively small banking sectors, less than half the size of the average banking sector in the region.Banking systems in the MENAP region are relatively heterogeneous. Jordan and Morocco have the largest banking sectors within this subregion. Despite the relative size of the economy, Pakistan’s banking sector is relatively small (47 percent of banking system assets to GDP).View Full SizeFigure 9.Bank Asset Structure in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Fitch Connect; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Figure uses 2021 values.

Title: From cryptocurrencies to CBDCs, what future for money? | TSE
Content:
The development of cryptocurrencies should be seen in the context of a war between different approaches to offering economic players the possibility of storing and growing their savings and liquidity, of settling transactions, and of serving as a unit of account in financial and commercial contracts. In fact, there is considerable demand for currencies with low transaction costs, particularly for international transactions or for micro-contributions and micro-payments. [For example, the e-yuan has a transaction cost of 0.1%, compared with the 2% that credit card companies may charge].High transaction costsAny asset has the potential to be used as a currency, but very few succeed in becoming a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. Bitcoin, in particular, is a long way from achieving this. Bitcoin's transaction costs are still high. What's more, it has not yet adopted the two-sided payment card model (which involves charging the merchant and not the buyer, or even subsidizing the latter through discounts or free miles for using the card); today bitcoin serves essentially, at least in developed countries, as a store of value/speculative tool and has few benefits for transactions, apart from illegal ones.High volatilityThe very high volatility of cryptocurrency values is another factor making their use as a unit of account for contracts unlikely. This is why some cryptocurrencies are designed as stablecoins; the most important of these stablecoins today is Tether. The idea is to match the cryptocurrency with a collateral that guarantees its value. This collateral can take several forms. It can consist of securities issued in a traditional currency (such as the dollar), for example Treasury bills, or tomorrow a central bank digital currency (CBDC). These reserves must then be in sufficient quantity to peg the cryptocurrency to the chosen currency. But, of course, this requires an attentive prudential supervisor. For, as with all financial institutions, there is a strong temptation to invest in riskier, higher-yield assets than in relatively safe but low-yield ones (which is why the monitoring of the liquidity requirements imposed on banks by Basel 3 regulations is always a tricky business). In fact, in 2021, Tether, whose dollar reserves were supposed to correspond 1 for 1 to the number of tokens, was ordered by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to pay $41 million for claiming to be 100% covered by fiat currency, when in fact only 27.6% was covered. In addition, the platform may wish to grant loans to affiliated companies, which it must be prevented from doing.The need for a regulatorThere are, of course, other possible forms of collateral: financial assets, stored commodities (durable goods), raw materials, or even... other crypto-currencies (which might be useful if the values of crypto-currencies were negatively correlated, but unfortunately they seem to be positively correlated). In any case, only a prudential regulator, such as the ones for banks, can guarantee the public that the institution doesn't get too comfortable with the rules it has laid down.Moreover the nationality of this regulator is an important issue as crypto-currencies and the corresponding investors are totally global. One of the traditional roles of the banking regulator is to protect small depositors, SMEs and other regulated institutions against the risk of bankruptcy of the bank where their savings or liquid assets are deposited: see my book with Mathias Dewatripont The Prudential Regulation of Banks (MIT Press, 1994) for a discussion of the philosophy of prudential supervision. A national regulator may in fact be torn between the desire to enhance the attractiveness of its financial center (by attracting cryptocurrency-related businesses) and that of protecting those investors located on its territory, who are only a fraction of all investors, which therefore leads it to favor the former objective.The central position of the statesAgainst this backdrop, competition for leadership in digital payments will take place among at least three groups of players: decentralized cryptocurrencies, sponsored private currencies (Libra/Diem or any other Big Tech currency) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Central banks were late to enter this market, despite the competitive advantages they enjoy: the state decides what is legal tender, and can therefore force at least an optional use of its currency. This option becomes an obligation when it comes to the payment of taxes and other state levies. Finally, the state can force banks and fintech to join the state platform, as was the case for the renminbi in China and for Pix (a digital payments platform managed by the central bank) in Brazil. States will also be able to enter into agreements to make international transfers cheap, by ensuring that they are carried out automatically at the exchange rate prevailing on a highly liquid CBDC currency market. Finally, and mirroring the point already made in the previous article in this dossier about crypto-currencies, the positive benefit of CBDCs can quickly change sign in an autocratic state. The digital aspect of CBDCs will facilitate the surveillance and repression of citizens. Any additional power given to states requires the existence of the rule of law.Who will access CBDCs?The contours of this central bank digital currency have yet to be defined. In particular, who will be able to hold CBDCs, and in what proportions? Retail depositors? Those holding wholesale deposits (uninsured deposits)? What competition will there be for bank deposits? On this last point, there seems to be an emerging consensus that banks should not be drained of their stable funds. According to China's central bank, "the new digital currency is not intended to replace deposits in bank accounts and balances held by payment apps such as Alipay and WeChat". Similarly, a 2020 report from seven major central banks and the Bank for International Settlements defines the first of its three core principles in the following terms: "Coexistence with cash and other types of currency in a flexible and innovative payment system." Be that as it may, we must once again remember the economic fundamentals.The digital revolution, by facilitating the introduction of new currencies, foreshadows intense competition between the private and public sectors and among countries to offer efficient services for savings, transactions and contract writing. While it's difficult to predict the outcome, we can bet that the few economic fundamentals discussed in this article will be at the center of developments.Not all deposits can be guaranteed and/or demandableFirst and foremost, not all deposits in financial institutions are supposed to be guaranteed (protected in the event of the institution's difficulties). The risk-free nature of retail deposits up to a certain limit (€100k in France per depositor and per institution) is currently guaranteed by the State. Ideally, this guarantee is provided by a sufficiently robust deposit guarantee fund; failing that, it comes from a bailout by the state, provided the latter is solvent. In normal times, however, deposits are covered by loans (narrow banking is suboptimal). It should also be noted that Basel's prudential supervision rules now rightly insist on a minimum amount of equity and bailinable liabilities for banks. Unfortunately, all too often, deposit guarantees apply to all depositors, whether or not the deposits are insured, as we saw again recently with the near-bankruptcy of Crédit Suisse.Secondly, not all deposits in financial institutions are supposed to be demandable. If the transformation function of banks can be schematized by the characterization that banks on average accept demand deposits and lend on a long-term basis, it is normal for banks to have a portion of their liabilities in securities that are only payable at term (and compensate investors for this concession). This partly limits the banks’ liquidity risk.What to do?Broader access to CBDCs would considerably increase the size of safe demand deposits. Is this desirable? Let's not forget that, if a significant part of the banks' liabilities were transferred to the central bank, the government would be obliged to grant loans to compensate for the lost bank loans. However, the government generally lacks the necessary expertise to grant loans; it may also show favoritism for political ends in granting these loans; and lastly, it may be too lenient with insolvent borrowers (the "soft budget constraint" phenomenon). A more conservative approach would be to limit the amount per capita that can be held in CBDCs. CBDCs would de facto be the new insured deposits of individuals, and would pay the deposit insurance premium. The advantage of CBDCs would then be greater ease of use and low transaction costs for households.Published in La Jaune & la Rouge, n° 792, February 2024,https://www.lajauneetlarouge.com/magazine/792/Illustration Photo de André François McKenzie sur UnsplashFebruary 01, 2024Cryptocurrencies: an economist's viewFebruary 05, 2024Financing the ecological transition in Sub-Saharan AfricaAuthorJean TiroleShareSame themeMay 23, 2024How can we convince farmers to use smart water meters?January 25, 2024How should we allocate capital and share risks?December 11, 2023Low-carbon transition: what impact on companies' cost of capital?

Digital CurrenciesEconomy & BusinessFinancial RegulationIssue BriefApril 10, 2024Print this pageStandards and interoperability: The future of the global financial systemByAnanya Kumar, Alisha Chhangani, Jennifer Lassiter, and Katherine HaarTable of contentsIntroductionThe call for standardsDefining standardsA comprehensive overview of current standards on digital assetsLessons learned from standard-setting effortsEstablishing standardsKey themes for a CBDC frameworkConclusionAbstractOver the past few years, the global financial landscape has undergone a significant transformation marked by the emergence and integration of digital assets. Looking ahead, the global financial terrain is set to include a spectrum of both sovereign and nonsovereign digital currencies and both centralized and decentralized networks. This future brings the promise of enhanced efficiency, inclusion, transparency, and choice to global payments. To fulfill this promise, the international community must develop interoperability standards that prioritize a fast, highly scalable, and resilient architecture. The flexibility of this architecture to adapt configurability based on policy and economic considerations is critical to its success.This working paper is a foundational step toward a broader, global dialogue about digital asset standards. The Digital Dollar Project and the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center hosted a global convening titled “Exploring Central Bank Digital Currency: Evaluating Challenges and Developing International Standards” in November 2023. A version of this paper was released as a working paper to level set the attendees of the conference and provide a call to engage the public and the private sector in standard-setting efforts. This paper was further developed based on feedback from the conference and outreach afterward. The paper now reflects what we learned from our convening and incorporates the most recent developments in standard-setting efforts globally. The rapid growth of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) worldwide underscores the importance of aligning approaches to their development, adoption, and implementation across technical, regulatory, and governance levels. Today, there is a patchwork of first steps undertaken by both public-and private-sector entities, aimed at achieving different objectives. These efforts have focused on frameworks, guiding principles, and, in some cases, the development of standards for digital assets broadly, as described below. Some are CBDC-specific and others have general applicability in the payments sector. As governments and stakeholders collaborate to establish consistent benchmarks for CBDC development, it’s crucial to identify, organize, and align standard-setting endeavors. This process involves assessing existing efforts to pinpoint gaps and create a foundation for international standards that remain open and flexible for future development and innovation. Through this paper, we show the crucial element of interoperability, which is needed for the furtherance of standards on CBDCs and digital assets. We attempt to build the pressing themes around which standards will have to be addressed through existing and new efforts.IntroductionIn recent years, the global financial landscape has witnessed a profound transformation characterized by the accelerated rise and integration of digital assets. As a subset of these assets, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have captivated the interest of countries worldwide.1Atlantic Council, “Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker,” Atlantic Council, last updated December 2023,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/.The CBDC landscape has rapidly evolved with 130 countries, representing 98 percent of the global economy, actively researching and, in some cases, deploying CBDCs. A recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) revealed that the number of central banks likely to issue a CBDC within the next three years has grown in the past year from 15 percent to 18 percent for retail CBDCs (rCBDC) and from 8 percent to 15 percent for wholesale CBDCs (wCBDC).2Bank for International Settlements (BIS),Central Bank Digital Currency: Motivations and Implications, BIS Papers no. 136, November 2020,https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.htm.CBDCs, in their promise and potential, are emblematic of a broader shift—a movement toward a more efficient, frictionless digital infrastructure, shaping the future of international trade, cross-border payments, and global financial integration. However, with transformative potential comes inherent complexity. As fiat currencies become more intertwined with technology there are significant implications for privacy, human rights, cybersecurity, digital financial inclusion, and the movement of money across borders for international trade, aid, investment, and other payments. If designed without a common framework of standards and collaboration, a shortsighted and fragmented approach to CBDC development could lead to the emergence ofwalled gardens.At the core of establishing standards lies the concept of interoperability—the ability for diverse systems to interact seamlessly and reduce friction. In this context, interoperability extends beyond technical objectives alone; it requires a broader framework including regulatory and governance standards, paving the way for streamlined cross-border transactions, reduced operational friction, and bolstered trust among participating entities. While not a panacea, technical, regulatory, and governance benchmarks are instrumental in navigating the complexities of the international payments systems. In order to achieve interoperability, CBDC exploration should prioritize a thorough discussion on establishing technical, regulatory, and governance standards. (See Annex 1 for definitions relevant to this discussion.)This paper is intended as a catalyst to stimulate a broader, global dialogue about CBDC standards. It takes stock of existing activities, begins to define how these efforts may be coordinated and aggregated into a set of globally accepted best practices, and offers a baseline for addressing gaps or deficiencies in defining best practices.The call for standardsCBDCs are a digital form of a country’s national currency, issued and backed by the country’s central bank. They come in two forms: retail CBDCs (rCBDC), accessible to individual consumers and usable for everyday purchases and peer-to-peer payments, and wholesale CBDCs (wCBDC), utilized by financial institutions or other major entities for interbank settlements and large financial transactions. The motivations behind rCBDCs and wCBDCs are distinct. The deployment of rCBDCs is usually motivated by financial inclusion, payment efficiency, privacy, and safety. Interest in wCBDCs is aimed at addressing cross-border friction to improve international payments—including limited operating hours, long transaction chains, restrictions on legacy technology platforms, data fragmentation, high costs, complex funding, and compliance issues.3Josh Lipsky and Ananya Kumar, “It’s Official: The United States Is Developing a Bank-to-Bank Digital Currency,”New Atlanticist, Atlantic Council, December 15, 2022,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/its-official-the-united-states-is-developing-a-bank-to-bank-digital-currency/.Ultimately, rCBDCs and wCBDCs would operate in conjunction with each other to achieve both the domestic and cross-border needs of a country.4BIS, “Project Icebreaker Concludes Experiment for a New Architecture for Cross-border Retail CBDCs,” March 5, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/icebreaker.htm.Therefore, the deployment of domestic CBDCs must not be considered in isolation or the result will be walled gardens that stand apart from global commerce and economic trends. Creating a CBDC in a silo is unlikely to achieve the desired outcomes in the short or long term, as it will replicate the friction of the existing payments systems. CBDCs’ potential to provide a simpler and more efficient way to move money can only be realized as long as the CBDCs can interoperate with one another.If deployed, a CBDC must be able to operate across various transactions, institutions, and users. Many CBDC initiatives and explorations recognize the complex and interconnected ecosystem in which financial activity takes place and the interdependencies of the different participants in transaction settlements. By agreeing on standards upfront—which is by no means a simple task—CBDCs can hopefully escape some of the growing pains that we have seen with the development of new financial technology (such as automated teller machines that could only be used by customers of a specific bank) or new digital technology (such as the challenges posed by the early years of closed-loop email).Concentrating on developing and implementing clear and accessible global standards can enable greater industry collaboration and competitiveness through interoperability, transferability, consistency, and safety across various industries and economies. With this clarity, countries can direct their efforts toward aligning and promoting key principles such as privacy, free enterprise, the rule of law, and economic liberty within the global financial landscape.5The Digital Dollar Project:Exploring a US CBDC, Digital Dollar Foundation and Accenture, May 2020,https://digitaldollarproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digital-Dollar-Project-Whitepaper_vF_7_13_20.pdf.Defining standardsAt the heart of this paper is the effort to promote interoperability in payments systems and prevent the creation ofwalled gardens. We therefore define standards as the technical, regulatory, and governance benchmarks needed to achieve interoperable systems in the long run. It is crucial to recognize that standards do not emerge arbitrarily; instead, they evolve from fundamental principles, embodying intentional consideration and consensus.Standards specific to CBDCs are not unchanging; they must reflect and be responsive to technological development, market shifts, and experience. Standards are established by technical and governance bodies, often made up of diverse stakeholders, and reflect a consistent floor for pragmatic implementation across jurisdictions. Therefore, they must have built-in flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances across a variety of market structures.Our use of a narrow definition of standards as a means to achieve interoperable payments systems helps navigate the complex technical, governance, and regulatory environment. In the following section, we catalog existing standards for digital assets and the institutions responsible for setting them.A comprehensive overview of current standards on digital assetsMethodologyDue to their rapid growth, global standard-setting bodies have had to regulate and harmonize the adoption and use of digital assets across borders. In this section we provide an overview of the prominent organizations that play a pivotal role in shaping the digital asset landscape. Understanding the functions, roles, and importance of these bodies is critical for fostering a safe, competitive, and inclusive digital economy. We explore global governance institutions—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank for International Settlements—as well as regulatory standard setters—the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), and the Financial Stability Board (FSB)—and technical bodies like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Since rCBDC projects have largely been in the pilot, development, and research stage while wCBDC projects are currently limited, standard-setting efforts in some bodies have focused on broader digital asset developments.International Monetary FundAs a key institution in international monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability, the IMF is instrumental in assisting its 190 member countries in managing economic change. Its expertise in macrofinancial surveillance can help identify vulnerabilities associated with digital assets and it can offer policy advice to enhance the resilience of economies.In November 2023, the IMF released a virtual handbook on CBDCs, designed as a comprehensive guide for policymakers and experts in central banks and finance ministries. The plan for this evolving handbook is to offer about twenty chapters by 2026, with periodic updates to reflect the latest findings and viewpoints.6International Monetary Fund (IMF),Central Bank Digital Currency Virtual Handbook, last updated November 2023,https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/fintech/central-bank-digital-currency/virtual-handbook.The initial chapters address key topics like the framework for exploring CBDCs, product development, impacts on monetary policy, capital flow management, and financial inclusion.A publication called IMF Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency Capacity Development, released in April 2023, outlines the IMF’s efforts to facilitate peer learning and develop analytical underpinnings for advising member countries on CBDCs. In addition to research, the IMF provides technical assistance, including the XC platform initiative.7IMF,IMF Approach to Central Bank Digital Currency Capacity Development, Policy Paper, April 12, 2023,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2023/04/12/IMF-Approach-to-Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-Capacity-Development-532177.The XC platform, proposes a global centralized ledger to simplify and streamline cross-border payments. This initiative builds on the concept of wholesale CBDCs, but the platform includes commercial banks, payment providers, and central banks within a single, streamlined system. The XC model aims to reduce transaction costs and settlement times, making it an attractive option for countries looking to enhance their cross-border payment systems.Described as a “digital town square,” the XC platform would build a three-layer architecture: a settlement layer that acts as the primary ledger, a programming layer for executing smart contracts, and an information layer designed to protect personal data while ensuring compliance and facilitating currency controls as needed.8Tobias Adrian and Tommaso Mancini Griffoli, “The Rise of Payment and Contracting Platforms,” Fintech Notes No. 2023/005 (International Monetary Fund, June 19, 2023),https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fintech-notes/Issues/2023/06/16/The-Rise-of-Payment-and-Contracting-Platforms-534794.The platform’s architecture is designed to be open and upgradeable, ensuring its longevity and adaptability to future innovations. Instead of adopting CBDCs, central banks can issue certificates of escrow (CE) for use exclusively on the XC platform. CEs enhance financial accessibility by granting more entities, including nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), payment-system providers (PSPs), and nonresidents, direct access to central bank reserves. These certificates share characteristics with CBDCs and can later be converted into central bank reserves by financial institutions. According to the IMF, a key advantage of using CEs is that it allows countries to prioritize domestic use cases for their CBDC projects, while CEs can be used solely for cross-border transactions.9Tobias Adrian, “A Cross-Border Payments, Exchange, and Contracting Platform for the 21st Century,” International Monetary Fund, November 18, 2022,https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/11/18/sp-cross-border-payments-exchange-contracting-platform-21st-century.The XC model is designed for wide-ranging compatibility with existing systems, requiring central banks to make only minor technical updates. The model is a policy and regulatory framework; it encourages countries to adopt consistent and supportive regulations for cross-border payments, potentially incorporating tokens and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). In order for the model to work, however, it will need compatible legal and regulatory frameworks to effectively manage risks and ensure compliance across various jurisdictions. Tobias Adrian, Financial Counsellor and Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department at the IMF, furtherexplainedthis point at ourconferencein November 2023.Bank for International SettlementsThe BIS acts as the central bank for central banks, fostering monetary and financial stability globally. It actively explores the impact of digital currencies on the financial system and central bank operations. The BIS Innovation Hub facilitates research and development on digital innovation, helping member countries adapt to the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Its membership consists of sixty-three central banks and monetary authorities.10“Member Central Banks,” BIS, n.d.,https://www.bis.org/about/member_cb.htm.Recent significant projects include Project Mariana, which tested cross-border trading using CBDCs and decentralized finance technology, and Project Icebreaker, which focused on using retail CBDCs for international payments through a novel hub-and-spoke model, both completing their testing phase in 2023.11“BIS Innovation Hub projects,” BIS, accessed November 26, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/projects.htm?m=268&#8203.Most recently, Project Sela, a collaboration between the BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre, the Bank of Israel, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, focused on exploring rCBDC features including accessibility, cyber security, and effective public-private collaboration, with an emphasis on central banks overseeing retail ledgers and private intermediaries managing customer-facing services.12Bénédicte Nolens, “Project Sela: An Accessible and Secure Retail CBDC Ecosystem,” a joint experiment by BIS and the central banks of Hong Kong SAR and Israel, September 12, 2023.In July 2023, the BIS presented the results of a survey showing that 93 percent of central banks are engaged in CBDC work, with retail CBDC development more advanced than wholesale CBDC.13Anneke Kosse and Ilaria Mattei, “Making Headway–Results of the 2022 BIS Survey on Central Bank Digital Currencies and Crypto,” BIS Papers no. 136, BIS, July 10, 2023,https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap136.htm.The survey reveals most central banks recognize the value of having both a retail CBDC and a fast payment system.14Kosse and Mattei, “Making Headway.”By 2030, there could be fifteen retail and nine wholesale CBDCs publicly circulating, while stablecoins and crypto assets are rarely used for payments outside the crypto ecosystem.15Kosse and Mattei, “Making Headway.”This BIS finding followed its June 2021 report discussing its survey on CBDCs, which found that many central banks had not decided on issuing a CBDC, but had a tentative inclination toward allowing cross-border use by tourists and nonresidents. In March 2021, the BIS explored the potential for multi-CBDC (mCBDC) arrangements to improve cross-border payments by leveraging interoperable central bank digital currencies. Technology could play a role in addressing inefficiencies, and the paper discusses the dimensions of payment system interoperability and the benefits of mCBDC arrangements.16“Project mBridge: Experimenting with a Multi-CBDC Platform for Cross-border Payments,” BIS, last updated October 31, 2023,https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/mcbdc_bridge.htm.The BIS Universal Ledger interoperability model advocates for a shared global ledger that integrates various forms of money—including CBDCs, tokenized deposits, and other digital financial assets—into a single, programmable environment. The BIS aims to address the inefficiencies and silos present in the financial system by enabling safer transactions and atomic settlements within a transparent framework.The architecture of the unified ledger model is designed to be secure, scalable, and interoperable, with a strong emphasis on privacy and regulatory compliance. At its core, the architecture includes a data environment for securely storing digital asset representations, like CBDCs and tokenized deposits, in organized partitions managed by authoritative entities such as central banks and commercial banks. The execution environment facilitates the automation of complex financial operations and secure, efficient transaction processing. This environment supports atomic settlement, ensuring comprehensive transaction success or complete rollback. In addition, to safeguard sensitive data and transaction privacy, the model implements cryptographic methods like homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. These technologies enable encrypted data computation without exposing the actual data, reinforcing the system’s privacy and security. An important component of the BIS project is the governance framework that establishes operational and regulatory compliance protocols, while also detailing the responsibilities of all involved parties, including central and commercial banks.Unlike the XC model, which builds on blockchain solutions, the BIS’s unified ledger approach uses application programming interfaces (APIs), creating a more centralized system where transactions have to be processed and validated by authorized entities, such as central banks or designated financial institutions.17Adrian, “Cross-Border Payments.”Within this system, central bank money can circulate on a platform that is not owned and operated by the central bank, which can present risks. It also raises questions about the security, control, and integrity of central bank money when it is managed outside the traditional central banking systems.The BIS favors a system grounded in central bank money, offering a sounder basis for innovation, stable and interoperable services across borders, and a virtuous circle of trust through network effects.18Agustín Carstens, “The Future Monetary System: From Vision to Reality,” Keynote Speech at the CBDC & Future Monetary System Seminar, Seoul, Korea, November 23, 2023, via BIS site,https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp231123.htm.Basel Committee on Banking SupervisionThe BCBS is the global body for setting prudential standards for banking supervision and regulation. With the emergence of digital assets and their potential impact on banking operations and risk management, the BCBS is studying the implications for financial institutions. The committee’s membership includes central banks and banking supervisory authorities from twenty-eight countries.19“The Basel Committee–Overview,” BIS, n.d.,https://www.bis.org/bcbs/.The BCBS standard for prudential treatment of crypto asset exposures integrates crypto assets into the Basel Framework for banks.20Note a prior section on crypto asset exposures was removed in mid-December 2023. A new section will be effective in 2025 and is is available for viewing.https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/chapter/SCO/60.htm?inforce=20250101&published=20221216.Joint reports by CPMI, BIS, the IMF, and the World Bank on central bank digital currencies for cross-border payments emphasize CBDCs’ potential to enhance cross-border payments through international cooperation and coordination.Financial Action Task ForceFATF primarily focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing and has had less emphasis on specific guidelines for CBDCs. Its recommendations function as guidance on regulating virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to ensure the prevention of illicit financial activities. More than 200 jurisdictions have committed to implementing FATF standards, making the organization a key player in shaping regulatory frameworks to maintain transparency and security in the digital asset sphere.21Financial Action Task Force (FATF), FATF,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html.FATF has thirty-eight member countries, including major economies and financial centers worldwide.22That number includes the Russian Federation, whose membership has been suspended. See “FATF Member Countries,” FATF website,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html.FATF has published several papers related to virtual assets and VASPs. The first version of its Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and VASPs, released in June 2019, focused on risk assessment and monitoring, particularly for issues of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).23FATF,Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, 2019,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets.html.A twelve-month review of the revised FATF standards on virtual assets and VASPs was conducted in July 2020, showing progress in implementing these standards among some jurisdictions, but not yet sufficient progress to create a global AML/CFT regime for virtual assets.24FATF,Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach: Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, October 2021,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html.A second twelve-month review in June 2022 revealed continued progress, but indicated that implementation was still insufficient and certain challenges remained, such as the implementation of the “travel rule.”25Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, FATF, June 2022,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html.This rule is a legal obligation that requires financial institutions—such as banks and cryptocurrency service providers—to collect and share detailed information about the parties involved in a financial transaction.To address these challenges and based on the two reviews, FATF published Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and VASPs in October 2021. This guidance includes updates in six key areas, including clarifying the definitions of virtual assets and VASPs, guidance on stablecoins, and additional guidance on peer-to-peer transactions and information-sharing among VASP supervisors.26FATF, “Updated Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers.”However, the latest update on the implementation, published in June 2023, indicated that jurisdictions still struggle with fundamental requirements.27FATF, “Virtual Assets: Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers,” June 27, 2023,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2023.html.The report also emphasizes the need for appropriate risk identification and mitigation measures, especially for decentralized finance (or DeFi) and unhosted wallets (e.g., controlled by the owner rather than a platform or exchange manager), which have the potential for misuse. In 2020, FATF has also reported to the Group of Twenty (G20) on stablecoins, outlining its specific views on the application of anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing requirements.28FATF, “FATF Report to G20 on So-called Stablecoins,” June 2020,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Virtualassets/Report-g20-so-called-stablecoins-june-2020.html.There is ongoing work needed to ensure consistent and effective implementation of FATF standards in the digital asset sphere, and some jurisdictions are still struggling with fulfilling the fundamental requirements outlined by FATF.International Organization of Securities CommissionsAs the leading international standard-setting body for securities regulation, IOSCO plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and efficiency of capital markets. With a growing interest in digital securities, IOSCO’s principles on issuer and investor protection, market integrity, and risk mitigation have significant implications for the global adoption of tokenized assets. IOSCO has more than 120 members, including national securities regulators and exchanges from various jurisdictions.29FATF,International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism & Proliferation: The FATF Recommendations, as amended November 2023,https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Fatf-recommendations.html.While debates on which digital assets count as securities are ongoing in the United States, IOSCO has been actively engaged in providing insights into the realm of digital asset markets through a series of consultation reports and public reports.Policy Recommendations for Crypto and Digital Asset Markets, published in November 2023, stands out as a comprehensive consultation report proposing eighteen recommendations that address six key areas of concern. These areas include conflicts of interest resulting from vertical integration, market manipulation, cross-border risks, custody and client asset protection, operational and technological risks, and retail access, suitability, and distribution.30International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),Policy Recommendations for Crypto and Digital Asset Markets: Final Report, November 16, 2023,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD747.pdf.In March 2020, IOSCO releasedGlobal Stablecoin Initiatives, a public report emphasizing the applicability of principles for financial market infrastructures to stablecoin arrangements with systemically important functions. IOSCO’s work on exchange traded funds and crypto-asset trading platforms may also apply to global stablecoins.31IOSCO,Global Stablecoin Initiatives: Public Report, March 2020, PDF,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD650.pdf.In March 2022, IOSCO presented its public report on decentralized finance, highlighting regulatory concerns like fraud risks, flash loans, cybersecurity, and spillover effects on traditional markets. Additionally, in December 2020, the organization publishedInvestor Education on Crypto-Assets,a report to educate the public and investors on crypto assets and risk mitigation.32IOSCO,Investor Education on Crypto-Assets: Final Report, December 2020,https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD668.pdf.Committee on Payments and Market InfrastructuresUnder the BIS, the CPMI provides a platform for central banks to promote the safety and efficiency of payment systems worldwide. With digital assets gaining recognition, the CPMI is actively engaging in discussions concerning the potential role of CBDCs and their interplay with private cryptocurrencies. The CPMI has twenty-eight members, representing major central banks and monetary authorities.A 2018 Markets Committee report titledCentral Bank Digital Currenciesintroduces and defines CBDCs, assessing their potential implications for monetary policy and central bank operations.33Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI),Central Bank Digital Currencies, CPMI Markets Committee, March 12, 2018,https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.htm​.It recommends further research on various aspects including interest rates, financial stability, and exchange rates. The report also warns against the risks of private digital tokens due to their volatility and lack of protection for investors and consumers, making them unsuitable for widespread use in payments.Financial Stability BoardThe FSB’s mandate is to oversee and coordinate global financial regulation, identifying and addressing systemic risks to foster stability in the financial system. Recognizing the growing importance of digital assets, the FSB monitors developments and potential risks arising from their use and ensures that the digital asset market operates within established stability parameters.34Financial Stability Board, “Crypto-assets and Global ‘Stablecoins,’ ” n.d.,https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/financial-innovation-and-structural-change/crypto-assets-and-global-stablecoins/​​.The FSB is broadly focused on the global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities, and has not released any specific research or guidelines on CBDC development. The board’s membership includes a combination of G20 economies, other major economies, and international organizations.35Financial Stability Board, “Crypto-assets and Global ‘Stablecoins.’International Organization for StandardizationThe ISO fosters agreement on best practices and processes, and publishes standards and technical specifications (TS), including on the security aspects for digital currencies. ISO/TS 23526:2023 focuses on providing a security framework for the issuance and management of digital currencies in general, using cryptographic mechanisms standardized by ISO and other references. The document aims to integrate security aspects into the design of digital currency systems, as opposed to adding them later as an extra layer, to accommodate legacy infrastructures​.​36“ISO/TS 23526:2021,” Online Browsing Platform, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), accessed November 26, 2023,https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:ts:23526:ed-1:v1:en.ISO does not have any explicit references or guidelines on CBDCs’ technical security, but instead has a broader focus on digital currencies overall.The following organizations below were added after the conference and depict wide-ranging efforts for interoperability occurring both in the private and public sector.Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial TelecommunicationBuilding on its legacy in global financial messaging, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) has introduced a model to enhance its existing infrastructure for cross-border payments, making them faster, more transparent, and cost-effective. Currently in beta testing, this model facilitates the connection of disparate national CBDC networks, enabling them to communicate and transact with one another while leveraging Swift’s existing infrastructure and security protocols—best thought of as a hub-and-spoke arrangement between various central banks with Swift at the center. This initiative is part of a broader Swift effort to prevent the fragmentation of the global payments landscape into “digital islands.”37“Swift Advances CBDC Innovation as Interlinking Solution Begins Beta Testing,” Swift, September 13, 2023,https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-advances-cbdc-innovation-interlinking-solution-begins-beta-testing.The project began in March 2023, with over eighteen participants, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Banque de France. Within a twelve-week period, they were able to process over 5,000 transactions. In September 2023, Swift further broadened the initiative by announcing the participation of three new central banks: the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Central Bank of Kazakhstan, and an additional, anonymous central bank.Following the insights and successes from Phase 1, Swift released the takeaways from the Phase II CBDC sandbox project in March 2024, engaging thirty-eight central banks, commercial banks, and market infrastructures from around the globe. This project was designed to tackle complex use cases and assess solutions within a controlled sandbox environment. The second phase involved over 125 participants, who collectively executed more than 750 transactions. The sandbox was hosted on Kaleido, a Web3 platform for blockchain applications, where central banks were able to simulate CBDC transactions. Swift’s technology stack included a combination of the Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, and Hyperledger Besu platforms.38“Swift Advances CBDC Innovation,” Swift.Phase II explored four new use cases. First, it demonstrated the automation of trade payments through CBDC networks and smart contracts, aiming to improve trade efficiency and minimize costs. Second, it evaluated two models for foreign exchange trade and settlement: an International Foreign Exchange Marketplace and a Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) inspired system, both of which underscored the integration of CBDC trade and settlement. Third, the project focused on delivery versus payment (DvP), facilitating atomic DvP for tokenized bonds by ensuring interoperability between tokenization platforms and CBDC networks. Finally, it investigated mechanisms to mitigate liquidity fragmentation across various currencies and platforms, utilizing smart contracts and netting algorithms. The report established three foundational principles for interoperability: linking networks via ISO 20022 messaging, providing a unified point of access through Swift, and ensuring coexistence with traditional market infrastructures.39“Swift Advances CBDC Innovation as Interlinking Solution Begins Beta Testing,” Swift, September 13, 2023,https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-advances-cbdc-innovation-interlinking-solution-begins-beta-testing.This model leverages Swift’s global reach and the existing network effects among financial institutions. It also offers flexibility for countries to maintain their own domestic CBDC infrastructure while ensuring global connectivity.The Internet Engineering Task ForceThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is deeply involved in the development of standards to enhance blockchain interoperability, focusing on the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP).40“Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP),” Internet Engineering Task Force, accessed April 6, 2024,https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/satp/about/.This protocol is designed to enable seamless transfers of digital assets across diverse distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) by leveraging a network of trusted gateways, akin to the role border gateway routers played in the early internet. Such an approach offers a scalable and ledger-agnostic solution for the rapidly evolving digital asset ecosystem.SATP facilitates asset transfers through a structured process that includes three main stages: Transfer Initiation, Lock-Evidence Verification, and Commitment Establishment. The protocol ensures that digital assets are exclusively valid within one network at any given time, adopting a transfer mechanism that maintains the asset’s integrity and uniqueness.41Andre Augusto, Rafael Belchior, Imre Kocsis, Laszlo Gonczy, Andre Vasconcelos, and Miguel Correia, “CBDC Bridging between Hyperledger Fabric and Permissioned EVM-based Blockchains,” paper presented at INESC-ID and Instituto Superior Tecnico, 2023,https://www.dpss.inesc-id.pt/~mpc/pubs/Augusto-CBDC-2023.pdf.This is achieved through the strategic use of gateway endpoints which manage the transfer process, ensuring secure, transparent, and auditable transactions that adhere to Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) principles.42Martin Hargreaves, Thomas Hardjono, and Rafael Belchior, “Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) Core,” draft-ietf-satp-core-04 (Internet-Draft), Internet Engineering Task Force, ,https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-satp-core/.The SATP framework comprises a comprehensive set of API endpoints and resources for the initiation and execution of asset transfers. It also aims to facilitate the integration and management of digital asset transactions, contributing to a more efficient and secure digital economy.Hyperledger, an open-source community focused on blockchain technologies, plays a role in implementing and advancing SATP through projects like Hyperledger Cacti.43“Cacti, “Hyperledger Foundation,https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/cacti.Cacti serves as a blockchain integration framework that enhances interoperability by allowing operations across multiple enterprise-grade blockchain networks. It achieves this through a pluggable architecture that supports Business Logic Plugins (BLP) and Ledger Connectors, enabling seamless interaction with various DLTs.Global Blockchain Business CouncilThe GBBC has launched the fourth iteration of the Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI 4.0), a comprehensive project designed to map and analyze the blockchain and digital assets landscape.44“Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI),” Global Blockchain Business Council,https://gbbcouncil.org/gsmi/.This initiative provides an extensive overview of regulatory developments across 230 jurisdictions and six global bodies, compiles a taxonomy of 350 terms and definitions, maps sixty-three technical standards bodies, and identifies more than 2,000 stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, it offers access to 1,500+ courses from accredited educational institutions and includes four in-depth reports focusing on AI convergence, digital identity, supply chain, and sustainability, with a special spotlight on Brazil. GSMI 4.0, building on the work since 2020, aims to present a holistic view of global industry activity. The initiative’s resources, including an interactive map of blockchain and digital asset regulations and a series of reports, are available on the GSMI site (https://gbbcouncil.org/gsmi/). All materials produced by the GSMI are crowd-sourced and open access, ensuring they serve as a reliable information source for those interested in blockchain and digital assets.The Internet Governance ForumThe Internet Governance Forum (IGF), primarily serves as a multistakeholder platform for policy dialogue on internet governance issues.45“About Us,” Internet Governance Forum, accessed March 1, 2024,https://www.intgovforum.org/en/about.While not directly implementing or proposing specific financial systems, the IGF’s contribution lies in facilitating discussions, building consensus, and sharing best practices among stakeholders to influence the governance frameworks that underpin these technologies. First convened in 2006 by the United Nations secretary-general as a result of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) held in 2003 and 2005, IGF gathers governments, the private sector, civil society, and technical communities to debate and share insights on enhancing internet security, ensuring digital privacy, fostering the digital economy, and expanding internet access.Security, trust, and privacy are central to the IGF’s discussions on digital financial services. The forum encourages dialogue on how to protect against fraud, ensure the integrity of digital transactions, and safeguard users’ privacy and data in an increasingly digital global economy. Key areas of focus for the IGF also include the development of governance frameworks that protect user data and ensure a secure online environment. The forum also emphasizes the importance of digital inclusion, advocating for equitable access to the internet and digital services across different regions and communities. Through its annual meetings and intersessional work, the IGF indirectly supports the infrastructure and policies that impact the digital economy and financial inclusivity.As the above section shows, there have been some efforts in creating standards for interoperability of digital assets. From feedback after the conference, we added the work of organizations such as Swift, IETF, GBBC, and IGF in standard creation. All the organizations listed above have led to important standard making efforts as described. However, these efforts are concentrated in specific areas and, as explored below, some crucial gaps exist that must be addressed in any evolving framework for standards.Lessons learned from standard-setting effortsAs we evaluate the above models of governance, it is important to assess growth opportunities for the next stage of standard developments. In this section, we identify the critical learnings and gaps in standards development for interoperability of digital assets.First, the rCBDC experimentation space has provided countries with some experience in building CBDCs, largely driven by domestic objectives. These experiments are at very different stages and use a range of private-sector vendors that are not subject to the same regulations due to a slower pace of crypto-asset regulation globally.Second, within wCBDC experimentation, operating frameworks in technology and regulation have emerged, led by entities like the BIS Innovation Hub, the global financial-messaging cooperative Swift, and other private-sector players. However, they are constrained by the limited number of participating countries, furthering the issue of fragmentation in cross-border CBDCs. Current experimentation should incorporate standards-setting bodies (SSBs) such as FSB, BCBS, CPMI, ISO, and FATF as participants or observers to ensure better collaboration in the development of standards.The membership structure of SSBs significantly influences the establishment of the goals and priorities of these institutions. Additionally, while emerging market economies often surpass developed economies in the development of digital infrastructure, including CBDCs, they sometimes find themselves underrepresented in setting norms and establishing benchmarks. This underrepresentation can result in an inadequate consideration of their technological advancements within the organization’s priorities.Moreover, apart from the FATF, there seems to be a shortage of robust frameworks for assessing the global standards’ impact and implementation lags. To address the evolving landscape of financial technologies, it is imperative that new and non-financial SSBs be actively involved in these discussions, leveraging their expertise in technological matters and regulatory concerns.Finally, some of the above frameworks have actively involved private sector participants in influencing standard development and creation. As intermediaries, the private sector has a crucial role in the entire lifecycle of standards, from actively influencing the creation of standards to ultimately adopting and implementing them.Towardsestablishing standardsA transparent and collaborative multi-stakeholder approach is crucial for establishing frameworks for standards related to digital currencies. Standardization is driven by consultation processes with governments, industry specialists, consumers, regulators, and civil society organizations (CSOs). Historically, governments have provided the necessary legal and governance paradigms, in turn creating environments conducive to standard development and assimilation across multi-stakeholder groups. Central banking authorities, driven by the imperative of maintaining financial stability and directing monetary policy, contribute a nuanced perspective essential for shaping these standards. The private sector’s technological advancements and practical exposure play a critical role, not just in ideation, but in the tangible implementation of these standards, ensuring their practical efficacy. Lastly, the participation of CSOs provides reflection and inclusion of key social elements, serving as a check by society on the suitability of resulting standards.The goal of this collaborative process is the establishment of a guiding framework for standards. To begin this process, we outlined the following themes for CBDC framework creation, which align with the G7 principles proposed in 2021, to identify the key themes necessary to begin building a framework. These key themes are governance; privacy and data protection; competition and consumer protection; global impact and sustainability; and transferability and accessibility. Through conversations at the conference and outreach afterward, we aimed to test the robustness of these themes through a survey (see Annex 2 for survey questions). Within each theme, we describe the areas of framework development needed for the establishment of standards. Conference attendees and survey respondents identified thematic overlaps and largely agreed with these themes, which have allowed us to set policy priorities for CBDC frameworks.A thematic approach to CBDC and digital asset standard creationGovernanceEffective governance of CBDCs requires a nuanced approach, placing a focus on maintaining public policy objectives and central bank mandates including monetary and financial stability. To achieve this, the framework should involve the creation of dynamic mechanisms that not only monitor, but also proactively mitigate potential destabilizing effects. Stress-testing frameworks are essential tools for central banks to assess the comprehensive impact of CBDCs on economic stability. The principle of “do no harm” dictates that economic stability must be safeguarded at every stage of CBDC implementation, through concrete guidelines and risk assessments. In parallel, there is an imperative to establish legal and governance frameworks, offering clear definitions of regulatory benchmarks. Governance is the biggest challenge that emerges as we analyze existing efforts for standard setting, as each of the technical models discussed at the conference envisions an operator of an inherently global system. This is a complex and difficult endeavor, likely to have many challenges and phases.Privacy and Data ProtectionThe protection of privacy and data involves specifying requirements for user data protection, consent, and disclosures.46The Digital Dollar Project, Digital Dollar Foundation and Accenture.Mechanisms for cross-border data transfer should be designed to navigate the complexities of various data protection laws across jurisdictions, ensuring compliance, individual privacy protections, and seamless transactions. Operational resilience and cybersecurity require technology standards for resilience against cyber, fraud, and operational risks, including security measures, encryption standards, and incident response protocols.47J.

Title: Four Visions For The Future Of Digital Money

Four Visions For The Future Of Digital MoneyMoney is about to undergo fundamental changes in the way it is created and used, potentially reordering the financial system.May 14, 2023ByLarissa de Lima,Jason EkbergandDouglas J. ElliottlinkedinfacebooktwitterbirdemailExecutive SummaryWhy Focus On The Future Of MoneyParadigms For A Changing Competitive LandscapeFrom Paradigms To SolutionsEmerging Use CasesAuthorsDownload ReportExecutive SummaryDecentralized finance (DeFi)Money is about to undergo fundamental changes in the way it is created and used, potentially unleashing a dramatic reordering of the financial system. While volatility has shaken cryptocurrency markets over the past year and caused a string of failures, many parts of the digital asset ecosystem continue to advance largely unaffected by the turmoil, as we explored in anearlier paper. These include the areas with the greatest long-term potential to transform finance, including the tokenization of financial assets and deposits and the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) by most of the world’s largest economies. The rise of digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) continues to have the potential to upend the competitive landscape, creating new, efficient, nimble competitors, but also offering incumbents a potential new lease on life. Executives and policymakers need to stay focused on the opportunities and risks associated with digital assets.The future of digital assets as a whole depends heavily on the future of digital money, as payments power the financial system. However, digital money could evolve in quite different ways; for example, there are different forms of digital money that could form the basis of new approaches, spanning CBDCs, tokenized deposits and different types of stablecoins. Executives and policymakers must think in terms of multiple scenarios rather than relying on a single prediction. These approaches will transform business models as they favor different types of issuers and their adoption will reshape liquidity, market-making, and risk management, which could impact the broader financial system considerably.To help industry executives and policymakers frame their thinking, this report presents four paradigms based on the issuers of money, the technology they choose, and the use cases they target. Traditional financial institutions could successfully evolve or be challenged by the rise of digital intermediaries. Alternatively, universal networks could transform financial markets and business models, or sovereigns could expand their control of money and change the role for the private sector and its business models.In a world of significantly higher interest rates, the economic value generated from facilitating payments could be bigger and even more contested. Establishing valuable commercial propositions will be crucial to scaling different forms of digital money. Their viability, in turn, will depend on the policy landscape, technological innovations, and the infrastructure design choices that money issuers make. Each factor will play a role in determining the winners.Policymakers and senior leaders in the financial industry, both incumbents and disruptors, should consider a range of plausible future scenarios, evaluate their potential impact, plan responses for the most likely developments, and consider how to bring about the most desirable outcomes. This process may play out quite differently across cross-border payments, asset settlement, and retail domestic payments. We will follow up in coming months with papers that focus on these specific digital money use cases.The Future ScenariosWhy Focus On The Future of MoneyTechnology has transformed the way we think about and use money from the first electronic payments in the telegraph era to the rise of mobile payments and cryptocurrencies. Today that process is poised to accelerate dramatically. Distributed ledger technology (DLT), such as blockchain, is inspiring the creation of new forms of money, from central bank digital currencies and tokenized deposits to stablecoins. These digital monies have the potential to make payments faster, cheaper, and more secure, and enable new economic activity and business models.This transformation of money will both fuel and be driven by a broader transformation of the financial system. DLT is enabling the creation of a broad array of assets, from digitized versions of traditional financial instruments such as stock and bonds and historically illiquid assets like art, real estate, and intellectual property, to digitally native vehicles that offer novel ways to transfer value. These assets can attract participation by a wider range of entities and investors, as well as change how they participate, fostering the rise of new financial products and business models.Digital assets and technology also will change the shape of financial services and markets. By presenting transactional and ownership information on a single, shared ledger, DLT enables participants to transact with one another without the involvement of traditional financial intermediaries. It enables the automation and coordination of transaction processes among multiple stakeholders, which will change the cost and distribution of financial products. This could spur new private networks that displace existing intermediaries and allow greater automation and integration across borders and asset classes. Alternatively, it could create new opportunities for banks, exchanges, custodians, and other institutions that embrace DLT and adapt their business models.Money is at the heart of these innovations. A thriving digital assets market requires a seamless way to trade these assets. A digitally native solution that embeds money in the same distributed framework as the assets themselves will maximize the speed and cost-effectiveness of payments, as well the connectivity to associated services such as collateral management and yield enhancement. Of course, such a solution needs to be trusted, reliable, sustainable, and secure.While digital assets have the potential to transform the way we store and exchange value, their success ultimately depends on whether they can be integrated with the existing financial system. Such an integration has the potential to enable faster and more secure transactions across the financial system. Payments could be settled instantly and safely, at any time of day, and at the same time assets are exchanged, a process known as atomic settlement. The financial system could change significantly as digital money impacts liquidity, market-making, and risk management given its speed and automation.Evolution of Forms of MoneySource: Adapted fromIt’s Time to Explore Institutional DeFiEstablishing valuable commercial propositions will be key to scaling up digital money, but the viability of those propositions will depend heavily on the policy landscape and technological innovations. Capital and liquidity requirements will have a major impact on the feasibility of commercial propositions, while the integration of digital money across borders can create the critical mass to power new business models. But both of those elements require a coordinated approach by national regulators, which is still in an early phase. At the same time, advances in technology will drive whether platforms can handle the volume of activity needed. New platforms also face the classic chicken-and-egg problem: how to start attracting consumers and producers when the economic value generated by facilitating payments to participants depends on high transaction volume.Key players are making critical investments and strategic decisions now that will shape the future. In a world of significantly higher interest rates, the economic value generated by facilitating payments could be bigger and even more contested. Executives need to start preparing for the ways in which digital money can transform the competitive landscape in which they operate. We present four paradigms to paint the corners for how this transformation might play out. The future of money will likely combine a mix of these different paradigms, and in potentially different proportions across various sectors and use cases. Industry leaders should prepare for thefuture by considering the full range of plausible scenarios.Paradigms For A Changing Competitive LandscapeThe future of money isn't preordained. A vast number of market participants are working to reshape that future. Blockchain and digital native startups are developing innovative products and services that have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. Incumbent institutions like banks are investing in new products, such as digital asset custody and settlement solutions. Fintech firms are already making significant inroads in transforming the way money moves globally. Big tech firms are also exploring the potential for their own digital currencies and payment systems, leveraging their massive user bases and data analytics capabilities. Central banks are researching the potential for digital currencies to complement traditional ones. Finally, regulators will play a critical role in shaping which commercial propositions are both viable and safe.The future of money and payments can take radically different directions depending on the forms of money that gain scale, the technology designs issuers choose and use cases they target, how incentives are incorporated, and whether the regulatory and policy environment is favorable, among other factors.Changes to money itself can have a profound impact on the financial system at large. To help industry executives and policymakers frame their thinking, we introduce four paradigms based on the types of institutions that could produce solutions that scale. These paradigms are meant to support scenario planning and are likely to coexist. They are not comprehensive and do not cover every possibility, such as a future in which cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin become a major part of the payments system.Four ParadigmsPARADIGM ONETraditional Finance EvolvesDigital assets support the continued centrality of banks and other financial institutionThis paradigm represents an evolution of the existing system, not a revolution, as banks and other incumbent financial institutions continue to dominate. (We will generally say “banks” for short.) It assumes that banks largely evolve successfully, with digital money supporting their continued centrality to the financial system.For this paradigm to take hold, financial institutions need to demonstrate the commercial value of digital assets. Experimentation will lead to viable business models as banks become leading enablers for the new technologies, tokenizing both money and assets. Momentum could grow as solutions cascade across the system, from core activities like asset issuance and treasury to areas like merchant solutions and payments. Policymakers will be key enablers, providing regulatory space for innovation and potentially pushing new networks that reinforce banks’ position. This paradigm also will become more likely if regulation slows down digital natives or puts limits on potential commercial models.If banks can evolve successfully, they would thrive by ensuring their key economic and intermediation roles, pursuing new opportunities while providing balance sheet to support trading and lending activities in new infrastructures that lower their cost bases. Modernization of payments and trading could drive major efficiencies for clients by reducing liquidity needs, which would impact banking costs and revenues. This could increase market concentration as smaller players are squeezed out by margin pressure as well as the cost of adopting new infrastructure and the fight for talent. Even as banks evolve, institutions would continue to face strong competition for client relationships, including from big tech.PARADIGM TWOSovereign ExpansionCentral banks use CBDCs to gain share in payment flowsIn this paradigm, central banks would provide retail or wholesale users with CBDCs and use their instantaneous settlement capabilities to pick up a significant share of payment flows. Although central banks considering CBDCs are currently aiming to play a core role in payments without greatly disturbing the existing financial system, this paradigm assumes the process goes much further than current plans and does indeed transform the system.Radical change in the role of the central bank would require societal support. Individuals could come to prefer the features provided by retail CBDCs. Alternatively, demand could be driven by investors and institutions who want to ensure their digital money is fully backstopped by the central bank. This diversion of payment flows from private money to public could have a significant impact on bank business models, which would have to rely more on equity and wholesale funding rather than deposits.While the role of the private sector in money issuance might decrease, central banks might continue to partner with the private sector to distribute and maintain access to money. This could mean new opportunities and fee-based business models focused on the distribution and allocation of public money. Banks could find themselves in tough competition with payment service providers or new digital intermediaries. There could be an increased role for technology companies in providing payment services and infrastructure, as central bank money is integrated into mainstream payment systems.With public money having a greater role in the economy, central banks may then have more tools to enact and control monetary supply, as well as more real-time data. This paradigm could lead to greater financial stability as central banks gain more visibility and control over the money supply, but also create the potential for unintended consequences and new risks to emerge. Financial institutions would need to adjust their business models to account for the change in payment flows, particularly interms of their balance sheets and funding models.PARADIGM THREERise of Digital IntermediariesIn between evolution and revolutionThis paradigm sits somewhere between evolution and revolution, with digital natives gaining scale as the traditional financial industry struggles to adapt. Banking could be squeezed, with digital natives controlling customer access and expanding financial services provided.This paradigm can take shape if digital assets gain scale with intermediaries carving out key areas for differentiation. This could include a trusted digital money solution, with stablecoin issuers gaining scale, or efficient and compliant market infrastructure solutions, such as cryptocurrency exchanges concentrating liquidity. To capture institutional flow, digital intermediaries will need regulatory acceptance of their business models. Profitability of digital natives would enable them to launch compelling new services across financial services, including lending, origination, and liquidity provision, while traditional finance players work to overcome legacy technology, culture, and regulatory obstacles. Integration across services could be established through cooperation across the value chain, or itself become a way for new digital intermediaries to emerge that provide the range of services.Powerful new companies could emerge that operate globally and squeeze other financial institutions out of client relationships, potentially starting with younger, early adopters. As a result, competition between financial services providers would start to move from control of operating accounts to custody, as money increasingly moves into stablecoins held in digital wallets. This suggests banks and financial market infrastructure firms would be hit by multiple pressures, including loss of business, pressure to pivot business models, and costs to accelerate digital asset capabilities. Beyond banks, competition between digital natives could also accelerate and would likely include the entry of big tech players. Smaller proprietary networks might push for interoperability to ensure continued relevance.PARADIGM FOURUniversal NetworksRevolution – the financial system as we knowit is transformedThis is the most radical paradigm, one that would strongly transform the financial system. The rise of new open networks would enable borrowers and lenders, issuers and investors, and other market participants to deal directly, without intermediaries. Transactions would be powered and governed by smart contracts and institutional decentralized finance protocols. The trend toward capital market-based financing would be accelerated by algorithmic creation and allocation of credit over highly integrated networks. This could disrupt the business models of banks and today's digital natives.Radical change would require high levels of support. Policymakers could become more comfortable with this paradigm if there are trusted solutions to compliance and safeguards in existing networks. Alternatively, supranational organizations could enable cross-country collaboration for new platforms, such as the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) vision for a unified global ledger or the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) proposal for a multi-currency marketplace. It’s also possible that trust is built over time through experimentation with new policy tools. The European Commission, for example, put out a tender for a study on embedded supervision of decentralized finance. Networks that are truly universal will also depend on convergence around shared standards, as well as continued advances in technology that enable both scale and trust.This paradigm would imply greater participation and expansion of capital markets, but participation models could change dramatically as users and investors are connected by automation instead of intermediaries. This would require financial services providers (or new types of organizations) making using of automation to also expand risk management capabilities and successfully build incentive models. If users can control their data and wallets, that could encourage new services that blur the lines between banking and commerce, enabling financial activities to become embedded and seamless. With the growth and expansion of market-based financing, investors and firms alike would need to become more sophisticated about risk management.From Paradigms To SolutionsParticipants are already planting the seeds of these various paradigms. Policymakers are taking decisions and companies are exploring commercial propositions that will determine which forms of money are viable. The networks where digital money is issued and gains scale will define who is in the running to offer new services. These seeds won’t sprout overnight but senior executives need to start preparing now. Money has network effects and digital money could scale at a rapid pace.Contesting Forms of Digital MoneyCompeting forms of moneyCompeting forms of money will feature different business models and economics for their issuers and will need to win the trust of users that nominal value can be maintained. Generally, issuers make a profit by earning an interest margin on the assets backing the money and by collecting fees on payments, transactions, and bundled services, while ensuring trust by appropriately backing the issuance. In a world of higher interest rates, the economic value generated from facilitating payments becomes more attractive.Central bank digital currenciesare a digital form of central bank liability.Many central banks are exploring CBDCs to ensure the money they issue continues as an anchor of value in an increasingly digital world. A retail CBDC would serve as a modern version of paper currency or coins: made available to all individuals but digitally native and more similar in experience to a bank account, with similar levels of data access by authorities. Several major economies are expected to launch retail CBDCs within the next five years, including China (which has been working on a digital yuan project since 2014), India, and the European Union. An expansive retail CBDC could divert deposits from the banking system, increase bank funding costs, and reduce bank interest income, which explains why many banks oppose the idea. Some central banks are looking to cap the amount an individual or firm may hold in CBDCs and ensure they seamlessly integrate with deposits, which could favor banks. On the other hand, CBDCs might create new fee-based income opportunities for payment service providers that partner in distribution, favoring new digital intermediaries.A wholesale CBDC is a modern version of reserves issued on new central bank platforms to help financial institutions, not consumers, transact more efficiently with each other. Countries are exploring them mainly for cross-border payments and to settle asset transactions. By speeding up wholesale payments, they would reduce the need for banks and corporations to tie up liquidity for two or more days. A wholesale CBDC would retain the two-tier structure of today’s financial system, whereby central bank money underpins private money creation by commercial banks and others. The paradigm it favors will depend on which types of institutions have access to wholesale CBDCs.Tokenized depositsare a digital form of a bank deposit issued by a regulated institution.They are recorded on a distributed ledger and intended to settle trades of tokenized real-world assets or other digital assets. Tokenized deposits could take on different forms, whether account or token-based. Financial institutions and central banks have only recently begun experimenting with these instruments, and many issues remain to be resolved in both regulation and business models. For example, from a regulatory perspective, it’s not clear how capital and liquidity requirements might need to evolve if tokenized deposits lead to different behaviors and usage. It’s also not clear how deposits from different institutions will be made interchangeable and whether new business models will emerge to solve for that.Issuing tokenized deposits would favor banks’ economic position by helping to secure their funding, which has traditionally relied on customer deposits, and providing a currency for participating in the digital asset sector. This could be a key driver for traditional finance to evolve successfully.Fiat-backed stablecoinsdigital assets designed to maintain a stable value against a national currency, such as the US dollar, backed by assets denominated in that currency.These instruments play a major role in crypto markets, with more than $7 trillion in transactions executed in 2022, and issuers are exploring their use for real-world payments. Most stablecoins do not pay interest, unlike deposits, which can provide significant value to issuers in a rising interest rate environment. They also generate fee income from transaction and treasury services that scale up with volume growth. Digital natives dominate the stablecoin market and they could develop powerful new intermediary roles as the use of these coins proliferates. Financial institutions have recently begun to issue their own stablecoins.Stablecoin growth will require coherent regulation, and potentially adjustments to existing business models. Maintaining a peg against the dollar or other currency depends both on appropriate reserves to manage normal outflows as well as access to backstops in the case of systemic events. The importance of maintaining a peg was highlighted by recent contagion events in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, where concerns around traditional finance deposits spread to crypto markets. Stablecoin regulation has evolved at a different rate across the globe. For example, the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) regulation mandates that issuers hold reserves to back their coins; however, the United States might take years to develop comparable rules, given the need for legislation from a divided Congress.Decentralized stablecoinsare private sector-issued digital assets designed to maintain a stable value while backed by other digital assets.These represent a small fraction of total stablecoin transactions and their regulatory path is not as clear as fiat-backed stablecoins, especially given their reliance on decentralized governance. After the Terra/Luna collapse of 2022, coins relying on algorithms to maintain a peg have lost favor to designs based on overcollateralization. These stablecoins generate interest income from overcollateralized reserves, as well as fees from executing trades and collateral liquidation from margin calls.While a small fraction of current market activity, decentralized stablecoins could represent the frontier of innovation, making use of smart contracts and new governance designs to manage their balance sheets and distribute the economic value from issuance.These options are not exhaustive. The ease of swapping different digital assets through smart contracts means a wider variety of tokens can function like money to exchange value in a transaction. This can blur the lines between money and assets, enabling new business models while also creating new policy challenges. For example, funds kept with traditional money market funds need to be withdrawn to be used in payments, but this could change if money market fund tokens are recognized as means of payment in smart contracts or networks.Competing market infrastructure designsMarket infrastructure design and participation is becoming a key strategic and policy issue. In the traditional financial system, money and assets exist on separate networks, where banks have a privileged role in helping settle transactions. DLT-inspired technologies could upend this system and disintermediate banks. The more integrated and universal the network – that is, the greater diversity of assets and stakeholders that a distributed network contains – the higher the likelihood that new business models could emerge and disrupt banks.Because there are significant network benefits with digital money and assets, market infrastructures that are early in gaining scale might later be hard to disrupt. A variety of network designs have emerged, ranging from open, permissionless networks that defy national borders to tightly controlled ones, each one with different economics. Senior executives should understand the motivation, opportunities, and challenges for each design.Closed (permissioned) networksimpose limitations on who can access and manage the network. Financial institutions have used this option in digital asset experiments because it aligns closely with their existing business model as regulated providers of financial services. It also has greater policy support given the greater level of control and the ability to rely on existing approaches to manage risk and compliance. For example, the BIS advocates this approach in its vision of a unified global ledger.This type of network could be the least disruptive to the financial industry, while also leading to a reshuffling within the industry if some banks are slow to adapt. However, if only a few banks and participants join, it could make it harder for any network to scale up and develop a rich digital assets ecosystem.By contrast, inopen (permissionless) networks, participation is limited only by economic realities. This is the approach used by most crypto networks today. Given the challenges with enforcing compliance and regulation when there are no restrictions on access and usage, many in the industry are looking to build a “trust layer” to ensure transactions take place only among verified participants. Banks that have issued digital bonds and stablecoins on public networks have followed this approach. Project Guardian by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was an example of experimentation by the public sector. As discussed inour paper on the project, broader industry efforts are needed to scale this solution, including the creation of legal clarity, standards, and guardrails. A trust layer could enable digital natives to launchinnovative new services in lending, origination, and financing in a manner that gains policy support.Emerging Use CasesThe future of money is highly unlikely to be monochrome, with every sector adopting the same instruments, technology designs, and business models. Instead, it will grow use case by use case, driven by preferences and decisions made across business segments and geographies. The future will likely combine elements of some or all of the four paradigms. Here, we look at how these factors might play out among some of the most likely competitors across three major use cases – cross-border payments, asset settlement, and domestic retail payments.Cross-border paymentsSending money from one country to another can be a costly and prolonged process.Our joint papershowed that corporates move more than $23 trillion across borders each year and incur roughly $120 billion in transaction costs. A common digital platform linking national CBDCs to enable real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments could slash corporate transaction costs by more than 80%, or $100 billion a year.Over 30 countries have already started experimenting with using CBDCs for cross-border payments. In a pilot project with the BIS, the central banks of China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates showed that digital ledger technology could execute trades between the four parties’ digital currencies in seconds and reduce costs as much as 50% by cutting out correspondent banks and streamlining liquidity management. Meanwhile, new market infrastructures and business models are emerging. Banks have launched consortia that use blockchain technology for multi-currency FX net settlement and for payment-versus-payment capability. New stablecoins are emerging pegged to new currencies, with MiCA providing regulatory clarity for euro-pegged stablecoins. The cross-border opportunity is vast but the challenge facing all innovators is the need for coordination, harmonization, and interoperability between so many jurisdictions and technology platforms.Asset settlementTraditional asset settlement, while largely electronic, is still costly, time-consuming, and complicated. Processes are fragmented by asset classes and jurisdictions, with limited standardization. Digital money could introduce some greater efficiencies, but it would require the widespread tokenization of a range of assets to reap the full benefits of settling trades in CBDCs or stablecoins or tokenized deposits. We are far from that point, with total digital bond issuance amounting to just $1.5 billion currently, a tiny fraction of the $127 trillion global fixed-income market.Digital payment solutions could enable a variety of technology firms to compete with global custodians that have traditionally dominated this space. Institutional DeFi protocols can automate financial transactions and provide a more decentralized and secure way of settling assets and automating risk-management practices. Real-time settlement based on delivery versus payment can reduce the risk of counterparty default and free up capital for other purposes. Banks, custodians, and other traditional intermediaries will need to adapt quickly to harness these changes. Estimates on the expected size of tokenized asset markets vary widely, but there could be reinforcing benefits to redesigning both asset forms and the money that’s used to settle transactions, which would accelerate the rate of change.Retail domestic paymentsCentral bank digital currencies will be a big wild card in retail payments, with roughly 100 jurisdictions around the world exploring the issuance of CBDCs or having already done so. Few CBDC projects make use of DLT, while many leave the development of new payment features to the private sector. This could unleash competition between the firms that dominate payments today and blockchain-native innovators offering new value-added services based on programmable smart contracts or loyalty features like rewards programs. Stablecoin issuers are already looking to apply their technology to real-world retail payments. Open infrastructures that allow users to exercise more control over their data, an integral part of web3 ecosystems, could gain favor with consumers.The paradigms presented in this paper can help banks, businesses, and policymakers as they consider their next steps, but they aren’t mutually exclusive.We are likely to see some if not all of these types of money coexist and play a growing role, depending on whether they are being used for retail transactions at the corner store or to finance multi-billion-dollar cross-border trade deals or investments. In subsequent papers, we will explore these different use cases in much more detail, and we will examine how the paradigms could play out under different scenarios and what industry leaders should be doingtoday.AuthorsLarissa de Lima,Jason EkbergandDouglas J.

Central Bank Digital Currencies: Bridging Innovation and StabilityCentral Bank Digital Currencies: Bridging Innovation and StabilityIn a world increasingly dominated by digital innovation, the emergence ofcentral bank digital currencies (CBDCs)marks a pivotal evolution in the financial sector. Unlike traditional money,CBDCsoffer a digital alternative that is both backed and issued by national central banks, combining the benefits of digital transactions with the stability of government-backed currency. Understanding the depth and breadth ofCBDCsis crucial for financial experts navigating the future of finance.The Evolution of Money and Introduction of CBDCsMoney has seen significant transformations over the centuries, evolving from barter systems to banknotes and now to digital banking.CBDCsrepresent the next step, aiming to modernize financial services to be more resilient and inclusive. Central banks like theEuropean Central Bankand theFederal Reserveare exploringCBDCsto stay at the forefront of technological innovation while safeguarding monetary sovereignty.Technological UnderpinningsCBDCsare digital currencies issued by central banks that hold legal tender status, bridging the gap between digital and physical economies. While some countries opt for blockchain technology to leverage decentralization, transparency, and security, others prefer a centralized approach to maintain tighter control. Key technological considerations forCBDCsinclude:Scalability:Ensuring the system can handle large volumes of transactions.Security:Implementing robust defenses against cyber threats and fraud.Interoperability:Facilitating seamless integration with existing financial technologies.Privacy:Balancing transparency with individual rights to privacy.Worldwide Implementation EffortsDifferent nations have taken unique approaches to deployingCBDCs, reflecting their diverse economic contexts and objectives:Sweden’s E-krona:Developed in response to dwindling cash usage, aiming to secure public access to trusted money in a digital format.China’s Digital Yuan:Part of a broader initiative to increase China’s influence in the global financial system.Eastern Caribbean’s DCash:Implemented to improve financial accessibility and resilience in a region prone to natural disasters.Advantages of CBDCsCBDCsoffer numerous advantages, including:Efficiency:Streamlining payments and settlements, enhancing economic activity and reducing transaction costs.Financial Inclusion:Providing a gateway for financial services to populations typically outside the banking system.Reduced Operational Costs:Digital formats decrease costs related to printing, distributing, and securing physical currency.Monetary Sovereignty:Helping countries assert control over their monetary systems.Stability:Offering a secure alternative to private digital currencies and volatile cryptocurrencies.Economic and Market ImplicationsThe implementation ofCBDCscould significantly impact monetary policy and financial stability. By providing central banks with a new tool for conducting monetary policy,CBDCscould enhance control over the money supply and interest rates. They may also influence the banking system by providing individuals with direct access to the central bank’s resources, potentially reducing transaction costs and increasing speed.CBDCscarry significant implications for the global financial marketplace, including:Banking Sector Dynamics:With the potential to hold funds directly with the central bank, consumers might chooseCBDCsover traditional bank deposits.International Trade:Facilitating easier and cheaper cross-border transactions, potentially reshaping economic engagement.Innovation and Competition:Spurring innovation within the private sector, pushing financial institutions to enhance their service offerings.Despite the potential benefits,CBDCsraise significant issues, particularly regarding privacy and data security. Ensuring aCBDCsystem is secure against cyberattacks while maintaining user privacy is a complex challenge.Regulatory and Policy FrameworksThe successful rollout ofCBDCswill require comprehensiveregulatory frameworksto address potential risks and ensure smooth operation. These frameworks need to tackle issues related to cybersecurity, privacy, legal tender status, and international cooperation.

As digital currencies become more integrated into the global financial system, they may offer a more inclusive and efficient financial framework but will require careful implementation to balance innovation with stability.CBDCspresent a profound opportunity to enhance financial transactions, promoting greater efficiency, inclusivity, and stability.

This trend reflects the largest week-over-week increase since last April.

Here’s a detailed look at the anticipated trends and changes.2025 ForecastThehousing market in 2025is expected to see a slight rise inhome prices, projected to be between 1% and 2% above current inflation rates. This growth is anticipated due to increased real incomes and lower mortgage rates, which will enhance affordability. As millennials reach their prime home-buying age, demand is expected to rise, with new constructions attempting to mitigate the ongoing inventory shortage. Despite improvements, underbuilding will continue to affect market dynamics.2026 OutlookIn 2026, more buyers are likely to collaborate with family and friends to manage high housing costs. Emerging technologies are set to revolutionizehome construction, making it faster and more cost-efficient. Builders will be urged to consider the rising costs associated withclimate change, focusing on sustainability and resilience in new developments.2027 ExpectationsLooking towards 2027, demographic trends such as urbanization and shifts in worker preferences due to remote work will influencemarket demand.

These laws, approved by Governor Ron DeSantis, are designed to enhance affordability and protection for residents, touching on various aspects of the real estate industry.Boosting Housing ProgramsAt the forefront is theHometown Heroes Housing Program (SB 328), which sees an additional $100 million allocated to aid first-time homebuyers, particularly those in essential service roles such as teachers and healthcare workers. This initiative aligns with previous efforts to stimulate private investment in affordable housing, providing necessary guidance on local zoning and density regulations. Realtors are encouraged to direct clients to theHometown Heroes Program.In a similar vein, theMy Safe Florida Home Program (SB 7028)receives a $200 million boost, aimed at empowering homeowners to fortify their homes against severe weather, thereby reducing insurance costs. The program now includes free inspections and grants up to $10,000 for low-income homeowners without the need for matching funds. More details can be foundhere.Expanding Protection to CondosTheMy Safe Florida Condominium Pilot Program (HB 1029)extends these protective measures to coastal condominiums, with $30 million dedicated to strengthening roofs and openings against storms. Information for interested parties is availablehere.Additionally, theProtecting Private Property Rights (HB 62)law addresses the issue of illegal squatting, allowing property owners to swiftly evict unauthorized occupants, further details of which can be accessedhere.Financial and Environmental InitiativesLawmakers have earmarked $408 million for state and local affordable housing programs, alongside a mandate for a 1.75% deduction in property insurance premiums underProperty Insurance Cost Reductions (HB 7073). These measures aim to alleviate financial pressures on homeowners.Environmental efforts are bolstered with over $1.2 billion allocated for water quality initiatives, including Everglades restoration and mitigation of harmful algal blooms.Looking AheadFuture legislation includes increased transparency in condominium and homeowners’ association documents, with requirements for digital accessibility. Upcoming laws will also mandate seller flood disclosures and digital record-keeping for homeowner associations, with phased implementation over the next few years.These legislative changes, as highlighted in theoriginal article, reflect a proactive approach by Florida’s legislative assembly and Florida Realtors to address critical housing and environmental issues, promising widespread benefits for Floridians.Read More1310, 2024Opportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesGalleryOpportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesArticle,Housing Market,Mortgage RatesOpportunities Emerge as Mortgage Rates Decline Amid Record-High Home PricesByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-13T23:48:49-04:00October 13, 2024|Categories:Article,Housing Market,Mortgage Rates|Tags:Home Buying,Real Estate|0 CommentsAfter weeks of steady declines,mortgage rateshave finally reached a range that brings the dream of homeownership closer for many hopeful buyers. This shift suggests potential relief in the inflated housing market, offering buyers increased purchasing power despite ongoing high home prices. Experts indicate that the current conditions could favor those looking to enter the housing market before potential demand surges occur once again.Although home prices continue to break records, price growth is slowing due to loosening inventory and sluggish demand. Buyers are gaining leverage when negotiating with sellers, creating a window of opportunity for those ready to make a move.Despite the positive trend inmortgage rates, many potential buyers remain cautious, waiting for further Federal Reserve rate cuts that could lead to even lower mortgage rates. However, experts warn that waiting too long could result in missing out on favorable market conditions. Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, suggests that lower rates this fall could coincide with slower home price growth as more sellers enter the market and inventory rises.Housing Market Forecast for 2024 and 2025The U.S. housing market continues to be a hot topic, withhome pricesposting a 5% annual gain according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index. While this is a slowdown from June’s 5.5% gain, home prices remain at record highs, making affordability a challenge for many.Ralph McLaughlin, senior economist at Realtor.com, echoes the sentiment that home price growth will slow before rebounding. He notes that withmortgage ratesfalling to 24-month lows and a high probability of further rate reductions, home price growth could bottom out before reaccelerating as buyer purchasing power improves.Can We Expect a Housing Market Recovery in 2025?For a housing recovery to take place, several conditions need to unfold. Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH.com, suggests that inventories of homes for sale must increase significantly to ease upward pressure on prices. The recent decline inmortgage ratesis beginning to help loosen inventory, albeit gradually.After peaking at 7.79% in October 2023, the average 30-year fixedmortgage ratehas been below 6.5% since mid-August, landing at 6.12% the week ending October 3. This trend, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut, offers a glimmer of hope for potential buyers.NAR Practice Changes: What Buyers and Sellers Need To KnowIn a landmark settlement, theNational Association of Realtors (NAR)agreed to pay $418 million to settle antitrust lawsuits, leading to new rules that promote a more transparent home-buying process. These changes, effective since August 17, aim to benefit both consumers and agents by clarifying the financial aspects of real estate transactions.For decades, it was standard practice for home sellers to cover the buyer’s broker commission, but now buyers must enter into written agreements with agents before touring homes. Buyers can negotiate commission payments, adding a new layer of complexity to the transaction process.How Will the New Rules Impact Affordability?With buyers more likely to be responsible for paying broker commissions, affordability concerns arise. Matt Side from Realty ONE Group Eclipse notes that buyers with fewer resources could be particularly affected. However, he advises that sellers will continue to offer compensation to buyer representatives to increase demand for their homes.Housing Inventory Forecast: When Will There Be Sufficient Supply To Reduce Prices?Despite more resale and new homes entering the market, inventory remains well below pre-Covid averages. Many homeowners are “locked in” at ultra-low mortgage rates, unwilling to exchange for higher rates in a high-priced market, leading to demand outpacing supply.Rick Sharga, founder and CEO of CJ Patrick Company, suggests that a meaningful increase in supply won’t occur untilmortgage ratesreturn to the low 5% range, likely not in 2024. However, declining rates could loosen the lock-in effect, providing some much-needed housing supply.Will the Housing Market Crash in 2025?Concerns about a housing market crash akin to 2008 are prevalent, but experts like Tom Hutchens from Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions believe the record-low supply of houses protects against such a scenario. Today’s homeowners are on more secure footing, with many having substantial home equity.Jess Schulman from Bluebird Lending agrees, noting that further Fed rate cuts could lead to more transactions and potential home price increases due to pent-up demand.Will 2024 or 2025 Be Better to Buy a Home?Buying a house is a highly personal decision, and while predicting future market conditions is challenging, experts advise against waiting for the perfect moment. Orphe Divounguy from Zillow Home Loans suggests that the best time to buy is when you find a home that meets your needs and budget.Keith Gumbinger concurs, warning that waiting for better conditions may not be the best strategy, as home prices generally keep rising, moving the goalposts for amassing a down payment.In conclusion, while the housing market presents challenges, there are opportunities for those ready to navigate the complexities. Asmortgage ratesdecline and home prices stabilize, potential buyers and sellers must stay informed and prepared to make the most of the evolving landscape.Read More1310, 2024The $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkGalleryThe $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkArticle,Real Estate,Remote WorkThe $47.5 Trillion Housing Market Boom Driven by Remote WorkByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-13T22:48:34-04:00October 13, 2024|Categories:Article,Real Estate,Remote Work|Tags:housing market,Secondary Cities|0 CommentsIn the ever-evolving landscape ofreal estate, the nationalhousing markethas reached a staggering valuation of $47.5 trillion, marking a $2.4 trillion increase over the past year. This remarkable growth, as highlighted in apreliminary Redfin analysis, underscores the profound impact ofremote workon housing trends.Remote Work and Secondary CitiesA key driver of this surge is the allure ofremote work, which has reshaped the demand for housing in specific metropolitan areas. More affordable cities, often referred to as “secondary cities,” have emerged as significant beneficiaries. For instance, Newark, New Jersey, and New Haven, Connecticut, experienced notable increases in home values, with Newark’shousing marketskyrocketing by 12.8% over the last year. This trend is largely due to their proximity to larger urban centers and their appeal to those priced out of expensive metros like New York.The Subcity PhenomenonThe concept of a “subcity,” as described in acolloquial definition, plays a crucial role in this dynamic. These are cities that function as secondary hubs to larger metropolitan areas. With theremote worktrend solidifying into a hybrid model, thesesubcitieshave become attractive alternatives, offering affordability and accessibility.Winners and Losers in the Housing MarketWhilesecondary citiesflourish, traditional boomtowns and high-cost areas have faced stagnation or decline. Cities like Boise, Idaho, and New York City saw declines in home values, attributed to their already high prices or pandemic-fueled influxes that have since waned. Meanwhile, suburban and rural areas have also seen growth, with suburban home values rising by 5.6% to about $29 trillion.Challenges for Prospective BuyersDespite the overall market growth, prospective buyers face significant challenges. Elevated mortgage rates, limited inventory, and high home prices have made homeownership increasingly unaffordable. Asreported by Fortune, thehousing marketexperienced a freeze, with existing home sales plummeting to their lowest point in nearly three decades.However, there is a silver lining. Experts anticipate that mortgage rates may start to decline before the end of 2024, potentially easing affordability concerns. Until then, homeowners continue to hold substantial housing wealth, benefiting from the supply shortage that maintains elevated home values.ConclusionAs thehousing marketcontinues to evolve, the interplay betweenremote work,secondary cities, and economic factors will remain pivotal.

However, it may take time to reach the home value heights of mid-2022.The trend of buyers pooling resources with friends and family to purchase homes is expected to continue, as the rising cost of housing drives people to seek more space and privacy. This shift is likely to result in more multi-generational households and co-living arrangements.The 2028 Housing Market: A Buyer’s or Seller’s Paradise?Looking further ahead to 2028, the market is expected to experience gradual price increases, with an annual appreciation of 1-2%.

According toEducationData.org’s 2023 report, the average federal student loan borrower owes $37,574, while private borrowers face an even steeper average of $54,921. With these daunting figures, many are considering unconventional methods to ease their financial burden.Contact Your LenderFor those with private loans, reaching out to your lender can reveal whether credit card payments are an option. While not all lenders offer this flexibility, some do, providing a possible avenue for managing payments more conveniently.Utilize Third-Party Payment PlatformsFederal student loan borrowers might consider third-party platforms likePaySimplyandPlastiq. These services enable payments via credit card by converting them into wire transfers or cash equivalents, although fees ranging from 2.5% to 3% can offset any potential rewards benefits.Consider a Balance TransferFor those nearing the end of their loan term, transferring the balance to a0% APR balance transfer credit cardcould be a viable option. This method can provide an interest-free period of up to 21 months, though it comes with a transfer fee of 2% to 3%.Creative BudgetingA strategic approach involves reallocating expenses. For example, paying for groceries with a credit card can free up cash for student loan payments, achieving the same financial effect without direct loan charges.Cash AdvancesWhile not ideal due to highAPRrates and immediate interest accrual, cash advances can be a last-resort option. Borrowers should weigh the costs carefully before proceeding.Explore Deferment and ForbearanceFederal loan holders should exploredeferment and forbearanceoptions, which offer payment relief without credit damage. Private lenders may also provide hardship plans, though these vary by institution.While these strategies can provide temporary relief, borrowers must remain vigilant about the potential pitfalls, such as high interest rates and the risk of accumulating more debt.

Mind the Gap: Assessing the Market Implications of Retail Central Bank Digital CurrenciesNovember 14, 2024byRaj DhamodharanAuthorsDhamodharan Dhamodharan[1]Executive Vice President, Blockchain & Digital Assets at Mastercard.IntroductionCentral banks around the world have rapidly accelerated their exploration of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), conducting in-depth economic analysis, technical proofs-of- concept, and even large-scale pilots to understand the role that a CBDC could play in achieving their economic and policy objectives. As part of this exploration, central banks are carefully considering the feasibility of retail CBDCs[2]References to CBDCs in this paper are referring to retail CBDCs unless otherwise specified.as they continually strive to strengthen and grow their economies with greater innovation and efficiency. To do this, they will necessarily have to engage an ecosystem of participating banks, payment service providers, data service providers, payment networks, and a variety of technology resources. Collectively, it will be critical that there is active public-private collaboration to consider the impact that CBDCs may have on the future of payments and how best to safeguard the interests of consumers and businesses.Exploring the promise of new technology and the potential efficiency gains that adoption could bring has been an essential part of the modernisation journey. Innovative new solutions have been the drivers for sustainable and inclusive economic growth that benefit everyone, everywhere. However, the success of innovative payment solutions has always been contingent on whether they fundamentally address any perceived gaps in the market that existing solutions and services do not already adequately serve. It also depends on whether consumers and businesses believe that new payment innovations are superior to the (digital) solutions already available.Importantly in case of CBDCs, it will also be contingent on who is best placed to provide this innovation. Unlike commercial payment solutions offered today, retail CBDCs raise the more fundamental questions of whether central banks should be in the business of providing retail payments to customers and the broader implications this may have on competition. There are also problematic assumptions made in relation to retail CBDCs that relate to their need to mimic cash-like convenience, which has a direct impact on business models, distorting market dynamics and risking instability.This paper challenges the motivations and the assumptions made by central banks on how retail CBDCs would be delivered under so-called “two-tier” intermediated models. Section 1 explores the motivations outlined by central banks, and questions whether retail CBDCs are intended to act as “monetary anchors” for stability or, whether they are instead being designed as central bank-led market solutions. Section 2 then discusses the notion that a retail CBDC would be delivered under a two-tier intermediated model, highlighting the vast gaps between how the roles of industry participants for retail CBDCs are envisaged and how the current intermediated financial system operates today. Section 3 then delves into the commercial model for delivering a retail CBDC, which for many central banks, is expected to be offered free of charge to customers just like their cash equivalents. The paper concludes with the principles that will be needed for CBDCs to successfully address user needs, and importantly how the market can help deliver and distribute CBDCs.Central bank digital currencies: Monetary anchor or market solution?Today, there are 134 countries & currency unions, representing 98 per cent of global GDP, exploring both wholesale and retail CBDCs.[3]See the Atlantic Council’s CBDC Tracker athttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/Central banks’ motivations for exploring CBDCs vary across jurisdictions. Key goals often cited by central banks include creating a digital substitute for cash in an increasingly digital society, improving control over monetary policy, achieving geopolitical and strategic autonomy, enhancing resilience, increasing the speed of payments, reducing their cost, and facilitating financial inclusion. Above all, central banks want to ensure that central bank money remains an anchor of monetary and financial stability.[4]There are numerous references made by central banks that CBDCs would reinforce central bank money as the anchor of the monetary system, as well as acting as an anchor of financial stability. For …Continue readingDesign choices for the successful rollout of any new product will always place the needs of end-users at the centre of solution development. Ultimately, CBDCs will only meet their broader policy and systemic objectives if users believe that their value improves on, and is superior to, existing market solutions and there is widespread adoption. To determine whether CBDCs ultimately meet their objectives will therefore require central banks to clearly articulate the economic or market problem that exists in today’s payment system, how the CBDC addresses or solves this problem and what “success” looks like. This should be based on use cases that are informed by market assessments of current and future payment needs. This means that user segments are clearly identified, the value-added benefits of the CBDC are clearly understood by all parties in the payments ecosystem and that existing payment infrastructure and technical know-how are leveraged to help rollout and delivery.However, as is the case for many CBDC initiatives around the world, the motivations expressed by central banks are predominantly focused on policy and systemic objectives, rather than being primarily driven by specific customer needs, requirements or benefits.Macroeconomic, financial policy and international considerations will likely fail to resonate with end-users who – particularly in highly advanced payments systems – already have fast, safe and efficient ways to make everyday payments. Paradoxically, if CBDCs are also overwhelmingly successful and achieve substantial adoption and usage, this may mean that they have displaced other types of payment instruments and deposit accounts, materializing the risks of disintermediation, deposit substitution and financial instability. In such a scenario, “success” may also mean that central bank money no longer acts as an anchor of monetary and financial stability, but rather becomes the cause of market disruption and instability.Currently, the design choices being explored for many retail CBDC projects replicate payment features and functionalities already offered by the private sector. They are based on the delivery of a means to hold and fund retail payments in CBDC (e.g., digital wallets), the infrastructure needed to enable those CBDC payments (e.g., online, point of sale and offline capabilities) and finally, a scheme (e.g., like the ones operated by domestic and international card networks and digital public infrastructure). While the underlying value being transferred with a CBDC is a central bank liability rather than a commercial bank liability, this distinction is largely inconsequential for the average consumer. The form factors needed will also be indistinguishable from current retail payment products.It will be critical therefore that the intended benefits of CBDCs over existing payment solutions in terms of their novel application be clearly articulated to users. To ensure its longer- term viability, central banks should also outline the incremental value that CBDCs create that exceed the significant costs associated with their development, delivery, and operation. Market participants will find it challenging to invest in new infrastructure unless there is a strong commercial business use case for doing so. Above all, CBDCs should avoid replicating market solutions in pursuit of domestic, geopolitical or macro-financial policy goals when highly advanced market solutions already exist. To do so could cause competitive distortions and inadvertently threaten the efficiencies that already exist in today’s highly evolved payments systems. It remains to be seen whether it is the role of the central bank to be direct providers of digital retail payments.Instead, central banks can ensure that central bank money remains a monetary anchor by “doing what only central banks can do”[5]In the House of Lords debate on the Economic Affairs Committee’s Report, Lord King of Lothbury cautioned against expanding the Bank of England’s responsibilities with a retail CBDC, noting that …Continue reading). Central banks are important regulators of payment systems and they are there to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial system. Central banks are pivotal for providing the necessary regulatory framework to foster safe innovation and supporting market innovation, e.g., in the nascent form of commercial bank tokenised deposits, which could play an important role in driving new payment solutions for the future digital money landscape (Oliver Wyman and JP Morgan, 2022). Importantly, tokenised central bank reserves in the form of wholesale CBDCs, together with tokenised deposits, would maintain the strong two-tier monetary system and provide the necessary monetary anchor to ensure the “singleness of money” in an evolving digital payments age (BIS, 2023).Delivering digital public money: the “two-tier” distribution model and interoperabilityCentral bank proposals for CBDCs recognise that digital innovation in payments is best served under a public-private partnership, which is critical to ensuring an open and competitive payment ecosystem. This approach is aligned with the existing allocation of public and private responsibilities within the financial system, and by extending a broader set of capabilities to the private sector, it would also provide a more robust platform for the development of value-added innovations. In the context therefore for CBDCs, a truly intermediated retail CBDC model could provide a secure, fast, and resilient technology environment that avoids the unnecessary expense of parallel infrastructure and ensures that compliance requirements remain primarily with industry. This approach also ensures that the central bank retains institutional governance over core monetary infrastructure, while relying on private sector competition to drive innovation, efficiency, and a diversity of offerings.Importantly, in a well-designed two-tier approach, intermediaries would continue to play a critical role in creating trust, meeting the needs of users, and enabling the successful adoption of a CBDC. As is the case for the current ecosystem, a two-tier model is based on the central bank issuing the currency and relying on market intermediaries to determine the modalities of distribution. These intermediaries then compete to attract customers through better and more efficient products and services and develop these based on market dynamics and commercial considerations. Therefore, if the CBDC intends to promote choice and competition in a two-tier model, the modalities of distribution and acceptance should be left to intermediaries and merchants and be based on market and commercial considerations rather than regulatory solutions.Intermediated models for distributing retail CBDCs nevertheless appear to fall short of such an arrangement in emerging retail CBDC proposals. Two-tier models, such as the ones that are being considered in Europe, require intermediaries to fulfil the role as distribution agents on behalf of the central bank, which are required to carry out these functions based on legislative mandates. This means that intermediaries do not necessarily exercise agency over whether they distribute and how they can offer CBDC products based on commercial considerations. Similarly, they will not be given the freedom to choose the means through which they would be able to distribute retail CBDCs. While interoperability is cited as a key objective for CBDCs, emerging proposals seem to indicate that they would need to be distributed using only central bank run-payment rails, operating separately under their own scheme.[6]See the Digital euro packagehttps://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/digital-euro-package_enA CBDC has the potential to serve as a foundation for innovative and value-added financial products and services developed by competitors within the private sector if there is agenuine desire for a CBDC to act as a digital version of central bank money. Open and competitive payment ecosystems are critical to enabling access, adoption, and use of payment options that serve a wide range of user needs, preferences, and financial inclusion. Moreover, ongoing payments innovation and the efficiency of national and international payment flows all depend on CBDCs being interoperable with existing payment schemes to ensure seamless consumer adoption, avoid siloed ecosystems and monetary fragmentation. For a CBDC, interoperability with other stores of value (e.g., commercial bank deposits, e-money etc.) would play an important role in strengthening the domestic payment ecosystem and reinforcing the role of central bank money at its core. Sustained collaboration between the central bank and private sector participants will be critical to delivering this interoperability.A CBDC must be usable for a variety of in-person and digital transactions to provide value as a payment mechanism. However, enabling acceptance points is a prominent challenge to driving mass adoption of any new payment solution. Consumers will be more likely to adopt a CBDC if it can be used on existing acceptance infrastructure and is supported by known and identifiable payment form factors (physical and remote) linked to the user’s existing devices and accounts. Requiring CBDCs to employ new payment rails would on the other hand create artificial barriers between the CBDC and commercial bank money, causing unnecessary friction between payment means and overcomplicate access and distribution. This would generate confusion and ultimately go against the ambition of an integrated payment market.Proposals that seek to mandate acceptance and impose regulatory models of distribution call into question a true two-tier model, which could result in unintended market fragmentation with implications for competition, stability, security, and innovation within the broader payment system. CBDCs will be more competitive, innovative, resilient, and better equipped to meet various policy objectives, as well as the evolving demands of the consumer, where the project works to actively encourage the participation of all payments market stakeholders. A ‘two-tier’ model that is based on market-led innovation is best placed to provide a secure, fast, and resilient technology environment that avoids the unnecessary expense of parallel infrastructure and ensures resilience.Ensuring a sustainable and competitive payment ecosystemMany central banks envisage CBDCs to operate functionally as a version of “digital cash”. This logic assumes that cash has characteristics that can be easily replicated by a digital equivalent. At a minimum, this means that users should have access to CBDCs at no additional cost, that it should be available at any time – with or without internet connectivity –, be accepted as a means to purchase goods and services and to be able to exchange it peer to peer. Importantly, it should also be available to everyone, to ensure inclusion and equity.However, unlike the relatively simple infrastructure that is needed to print and distribute cash, building new wallet solutions, integrating with new payment infrastructure, developing offline solutions, and enabling the various links in the payment value chain are all costly andcomplex activities. Sustainable digital payment ecosystems are dependent on a delicate balancing of incentives between those stakeholders who bear the costs of enabling payments and those who benefit from payment services. For a central bank’s CBDC infrastructure to sustain a vibrant and competitive ecosystem of payments innovators, incentives will need to exist that allow payment service providers to generate an appropriate return on their investments.Compensation models therefore need to consider the potentially significant new implementation and running costs that merchants and intermediaries will need to incur to offer CBDC services. These include, but not limited to, adapting front and backend systems, customer onboarding processes, operational and other security upgrades. Many central banks are also discussing the possibility that CBDCs could run on entirely new technology, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT). Others are also considering the need to adopt state-of-the- art privacy enhancing technologies, which are promising but have yet to be run and operated at scale. Accordingly, compensation models also need to factor in the feasibility for industry to adopt such new technologies. New teams of expertise would be needed with detailed knowledge of this new technology over the lifecycle of their development, leading to potentially high operational costs and excessive complexity for some payment intermediaries.Thought should also be given to how well existing regulation is equipped to address downstream applications of a CBDC via new technologies. Regulatory guidance in this area would be essential to help participants apply existing rules to innovative payment services involving a CBDC according to whatever technological form it is designed to function. For example, if parallel DLT infrastructure is required to support a CBDC that will function offline– consideration will need to be given to any additional regulatory requirements applicable to the use of this technology.Another key area of risk that is often given limited consideration is the enormous complexity and costs of mitigating fraud and cyber-risk across a retail CBDC ecosystem. The cost to the global economy of cybercrime is expected to grow by 15 percent per year over the next five years, reaching $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025.8 A retail CBDC will inevitably face sophisticated fraud and cyberattacks from both private and state-sponsored actors. CBDC users must trust that the system will be accessible and operational where and when it is needed; that their funds, accounts, identity, and other data are secure; and that they will be protected in the event of fraud.Importantly, unlike commercial means of payment, end users will hold the CBDC to a much higher standard given that it will be compared to its closest equivalent – the physical banknote. Users will also assume that as it is issued and backed by the central bank (often cited as the key benefit of a CBDC) it would be more secure than commercial alternatives. Should the CBDC therefore suffer from any vulnerability due to weak end-points, the underlying credibility of the CBDC and implicitly the central bank may be impacted as a result.The premise of CBDC innovation and scalability is built on the ability of intermediaries to offer consumers new digital services to enhance the convenience and utility of their CBDC accounts. If the cost to intermediaries and service providers for the provision of the CBDC is greater than a comparable digital means of payment, industry will not be incentivized to provide high-quality CBDC services, which may affect the success of the CBDC. The same competitive conditions should therefore be applied to CBDC and comparable payment services. Likewise, if central banks propose mandatory acceptance, intermediaries and merchants must not be constrained by regulated levels of compensation or, the payment rails through which they distribute and accept a CBDC. Instead, they should be given the choice to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective way to recuperate the costs being imposed as well as deliver commercially viable solutions to their customers.From a business perspective, while merchants are applauding CBDC initiatives in the hope of reduced costs, CBDCs risk disintermediating banks in the distribution of money and constraining existing private payment solutions. The risk of endangering competition and innovation due to excessive central bank’s intervention is high. This is why it is crucial to strike the right balance between public intervention and private sector initiative in regulating CBDCs. Above all, a CBDC should be financially self-sustaining, i.e., operate without any public subsidies on investment or operational costs. Otherwise, there is a risk that the CBDC will have the unintended consequences of reducing the diversity, competitiveness, and resilience in the payment landscape.Conclusion: principles for an open, competitive, and innovative payment market using CBDCsIt is essential that governments and central banks adopt specific measures to ensure an open, competitive, and innovative payment market using CBDCs. These actions should focus on creating a level-playing field for all payment solutions, encouraging private sector participation, and fostering technological advancements. By doing so, central banks can support a dynamic financial ecosystem where multiple payment methods coexist and compete, ultimately benefiting consumers through increased choice and improved services. By focusing on ensuring a well-functioning market, central banks can drive improvements in efficiency, innovation, and service quality to the benefit of consumers and thereby remaining an anchor for monetary and financial stability.While the motivations driving central banks to explore CBDCs differ, there remains a common set of principles that all CBDC initiatives should support. These tenets will best serve the needs of consumers, preserve the health of the financial system, and ensure that consumers continue to have access to a robust and innovative array of payment options (McWaters, 2024).Promote Mutual Trust and a Global Approach to Payments.Encouraging a global regulatory framework that supports multilateral initiatives ensures that sovereignty and geopolitical goals do not create barriers to competition and investment. Strengthening the elationship between jurisdictions is essential to prevent race-to-the-bottom scenarios where national champions are favored over foreign competition. This collaborative approach will uphold the commitment of advanced economies to an open free market economy. CBDCs should be designed to integrate with existing payment solutions, promoting unity rather than exclusion in the global payments landscape.Foster Genuine Public-Private Cooperation.Establishing open and ongoing dialogue between regulators and private market participants ensures that CBDC projects are aligned with market needs and have the best chance of success. Clearly delineating the roles and responsibilities of the central bank and private entities ensures that the central bank does not encroach on market activities that are more efficiently managed by private parties. Private sector innovation can be encouraged by avoiding overly prescriptive, top-down regulation that may stifle creativity and adaptability. This collaborative approach will leverage the strengths of both public and private sectors, fostering a dynamic and innovative payment ecosystem.Ensure a Level-Playing Field.Implementing regulations that allow CBDCs and private payment solutions to compete on fair terms will ensure a level playing field. This includes avoiding undue advantages for CBDCs from both a business and regulatory perspective. To achieve this the following guidelines should be followed:Mandatory acceptance.If CBDCs are granted mandatory acceptance by merchants, they would have a significant advantage over private payment solutions, which take years to scale up merchant acceptance. Careful consideration is needed to balance this.Market-Driven Compensation and Pricing.The compensation and pricing for CBDCs should be in line with the market (ie based on market analysis, established market impact assessments and pricing regulation) to ensure fairness. Above all, public subsidies should be avoided. The cornerstone of an open market economy is based on vibrant competition which drives better consumer outcomes.Regulatory Impartiality.As the issuer and regulator, the central bank should not exploit its privileged position to disadvantage competing payment methods. Regulatory measures must be impartial.Consistent Regulatory Standards.Apply the principle of “same activity, same risk, same regulation” to ensure that CBDCs are subject to the same regulatory requirements (e.g., oversight and AML checks) as private payment solutions.Create Interoperability:Designing CBDCs to integrate seamlessly with existing national and international payment systems is critical. This means relying on widely used standards and technologies to minimize costs and implementation burdens for intermediaries, service providers and merchants. Focusing on interoperability, rather than building a new infrastructure, would increase resilience and promote innovation by allowing the industry to build new services based on existing ones, thus reducing time-to-market. Ensuring compatibility with a wide array of solutions, including traditional banking, stablecoins, and potentially other CBDCs, is essential.By taking these positive actions, central banks, governments and legislators can create an environment where both CBDCs and private payment solutions thrive, driving competition, innovation, and improved financial services for all users. Partnerships between the public and private sectors will be key to successfully ushering in transformational change, drive adoption, and create the best end-user experience. Ongoing payments innovation, expanded financial inclusion, and the efficiency of national and international payment flows all depend on vibrant private sector competition. If a CBDC is the right path for a central bank to reach its objectives, the private sector can help central banks bring their vision to life and realize their goals.ReferencesMcWaters, J., Wann, J., Baert, C., De Matteis, A., and Cuccuru, P.

The Rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies: A New Era in FinanceIn the rapidly evolving world of finance, **central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)** are emerging as a transformative force. A **CBDC** is a digital representation of a nation’s fiat currency, issued and regulated by its central bank. Unlike the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, **CBDCs** aim to maintain a stable value tied directly to the country’s existing currency.Countries around the globe, from theBahamasto China, are actively exploring or have already initiated **CBDC projects**. The primary objective is to enhance financial inclusion, offering secure and efficient payment options for those without access to traditional banking systems. As noted in areportby the U.S. Federal Reserve, **CBDCs** have the potential to significantly reduce cross-border transaction costs, bolster the international standing of dominant currencies like the dollar, and simplify access to financial services.However, this shift to digital currencies also presents several challenges. **Privacy concerns**, potential **cybersecurity threats**, and the impact on existing banking structures are critical issues that need careful consideration. Ensuring robust **cybersecurity frameworks** and balancing transaction monitoring to prevent financial crimes are essential steps in this journey.**CBDCs** are categorized into two main types:wholesaleandretail. Wholesale **CBDCs** are typically used by financial institutions for interbank transactions, while retail **CBDCs** are consumer-focused, allowing potentially anonymous transactions using public or private keys.While smaller nations like Jamaica, Nigeria, and the Bahamas have already implemented **CBDCs**, larger economies and groups like the G20 are still in the exploratory stages, assessing the implications for monetary policy and financial stability.For more in-depth information, the original article can be found onInvestopedia.Leave A CommentCancel replyCommentSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.Total Views: 13Daily Views: 0ByCameron Academy AuthorCategories:Article,Digital Currency,FinanceTags:Central Bank Digital Currencies,Financial InclusionPublished On: December 13, 2024Last Updated: December 13, 2024Review This PageAny Further Feedback?SubmitWe have received your VOTE!

Despite numerous economic pressures, home prices remain steadfast, a phenomenon senior editor-at-large Shawn Tully likened to “defying gravity.”Commercial Real Estate in CrisisThe conversation shifted between the residential and commercial sectors, withJulie Ingersoll, fromCBRE Investment Management, highlighting the vulnerabilities faced bycommercial real estate. The sector grapples with higher interest rates and dwindling demand, particularly in office spaces. Ingersoll noted the alarming office vacancy rate, which has soared to 18% and may soon reach 20%.The NIMBY ChallengeThe dialogue also addressed the historic inventory crisis exacerbated byNIMBYism—”not in my backyard” attitudes that hinder housing development. Ingersoll pointed to California’s struggles, where policy failures and community resistance continue to stifle housing supply despite recent legislative efforts to ease building constraints.The Remote Work RevolutionRemote work‘s enduring impact on real estate was another focal point. Sean Dobson, ofAmherst Group, discussed how remote work has reshaped the sector, contributing to the pandemic housing boom and altering office dynamics. He predicted that hybrid work models are here to stay, challenging traditional commuting cultures.Converting Commercial to ResidentialIngersoll proposed converting underutilized commercial properties into residential spaces as a potential solution to thehousing shortage.

However, many cities are increasingly looking tozoning reformas a pivotal strategy to boost housing supply. AsUrban Land Magazinereports, the severity of the crisis has pushed it to the forefront of political agendas, making politicians more inclined to tackle the issue.City planner M. Nolan Gray, author ofArbitrary Lines: How Zoning Broke the American City and How to Fix It, highlights the shift in urban policies. “Dozens of cities have scrapped exclusionary single-family home zoning and parking requirements, which was previously inconceivable,” Gray notes.The Shift Towards Inclusive ZoningDavid Garcia, policy director for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, underscores the growing openness tozoning changes. “Many jurisdictions are reluctant to usezoning reformdue to backlash, but the idea of allowing multiple units on single-family parcels is gaining traction,” Garcia explains.Despite the momentum, the impact of recentzoning changesis still unfolding. Garcia warns that piecemeal reforms may not achieve the desired outcomes, and comprehensivezoning changesare often challenging to implement.According to Toccarra Nicole Thomas, director of land use and development at Smart Growth America,zoninghas historically contributed to the crisis by focusing on low-density, auto-centric housing. “Zoning is inherently inflexible,” Thomas asserts. She advocates for comprehensive reform to effectively generateaffordable housing.Strategies for Effective Zoning ReformGray suggests that allowing “by right” building permits could significantly streamline the development process. Other recommendedzoning reformsinclude reducing lot size requirements, eliminating parking restrictions, and allowing manufactured housing.Reducing lot size requirementsEliminating parking restrictionsAllowing manufactured housingSeveral cities have successfully implementedzoning reforms. In Oakland, California, the transformation of Auto Row into a residential hub is a prime example. Similarly, Washington, D.C., has seen the revitalization of former industrial areas like the Navy Yard and NoMa into vibrant mixed-use communities.Political Challenges and OpportunitiesZoning reformis not without its political challenges. Thomas points out that reform efforts often face opposition from NIMBYs (Not In My Backyard) and BANANAs (Building Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything). However, engaging with community stakeholders and building coalitions can help overcome resistance.Garcia advises developers to engage with communities early in the planning process to demonstrate the benefits of new housing developments. “Data showing that new housing can increase the value of existing homes can be persuasive,” he says.Ultimately,zoning reformis a gradual process. As Gray emphasizes, “We’re rolling back 100 years of policy that made it nearly impossible to build housing in dense cities, so it will take time to fix.” Yet, progress is being made, and the potential for transformative change is on the horizon.For further insights, explore theReshaping the City: Zoning for a More Equitable, Resilient, and Sustainable Futurereport and the accompanyingwebinar, featuring experts like Nolan Gray and Toccarra Nicole Thomas.“`Read More1410, 2024Florida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesGalleryFlorida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesArticle,Economics,EnvironmentFlorida Struggling to Regain Footing After Consecutive HurricanesByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T23:49:32-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Economics,Environment|Tags:Natural Disasters,Politics|0 CommentsFlorida Faces Daunting Recovery After Dual Hurricane AssaultAsHurricane Miltongathered strength in the south-western Gulf of Mexico,Floridabraced itself for a second blow in as many weeks. The state, still nursing wounds from the recent wrath ofHurricane Helene, found itself once again in the crosshairs of nature’s fury.The impact of these consecutive storms has been nothing short of catastrophic. While major urban centers likeTampaandSt Petersburgnarrowly avoided the worst, other regions along the Gulf coast were not as fortunate. The devastation has been unprecedented, withdestruction sweepingthrough communities, leaving a trail of ruin in its wake.The human toll is staggering: approximately250 lives lost, countless homes destroyed, and millions left without power. The financial cost is equally severe, with early estimates placing the damage fromHurricane Miltonalone at$160 billion to $180 billion. When combined with the losses fromHurricane Helene, Florida is facing a financial hit nearinghalf a trillion dollars, a figure that threatens to erase expected economic growth for the coming quarters.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, addressing the situation, noted the resilience required to recover from such disasters. “We did not get the worst-case scenario, but we did get hit,” he said, emphasizing the long road to recovery ahead. The state’s experience as themost hurricane-proneregion in the nation underscores the challenges that lie ahead.Even as rescue operations continue, the broader implications of these storms are becoming apparent. Theelectoral process, already under strain fromHurricane Helene, faces further disruption. Efforts are underway to ensure voting can proceed smoothly, with measures in place to accommodate displaced residents and affected polling sites.Beyond immediate concerns, the hurricanes’ impact on Florida’sreal estateandinsurance marketscould be profound. Theinsurance crisisin particular, exacerbated by these events, demands urgent attention. Experts believe these storms could finally prompt legislative action to address systemic issues in the market.Despite the challenges, the allure of Florida remains strong. The state has historically seen economic growth following hurricanes, and the influx of new residents is unlikely to slow significantly. AsKen Johnsonfrom the University of Mississippi notes, “There’s momentum for business capital to come in, and folks do still want to retire to Florida.”ConclusionFlorida stands at a crossroads, grappling with the immediate aftermath of two devastating hurricanes while looking ahead to a complex recovery. The resilience of its people and the state’s ability to adapt will be crucial in navigating the challenges ahead.Read More1410, 2024The Housing Dilemma in Steamboat SpringsGalleryThe Housing Dilemma in Steamboat SpringsArticle,Community Development,Real EstateThe Housing Dilemma in Steamboat SpringsByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T22:49:05-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Community Development,Real Estate|Tags:Housing,Local Politics|0 CommentsThe Housing Dilemma in Steamboat SpringsIn the picturesque town ofSteamboat Springs, Colorado, a fierce debate is underway over a proposed housing development known asBrown Ranch. This once-affordable“cowboy ski town”is grappling with skyrocketing real estate prices that have left even high-income professionals struggling to find homes.Rising Real Estate ChallengesSince the pandemic,Steamboat Springshas seen single-family home prices soar by about 80% to an average of $1.8 million. The surge has put homeownership out of reach for many, with property taxes also escalating by 86%. Local realtors report that competition is so intense that those without all-cash offers are often sidelined.Read more about the housing crisis.Brown Ranch: A Divisive ProposalTheYampa Valley Housing Authority’s Brown Ranch projecthas ignited a community-wide debate. Proponents argue that the development is essential for providingaffordable housing. However, opponents, led by longtime resident Jim Engelken, voice concerns about its scale and impact on local infrastructure. Engelken, who has lived in Steamboat since 1979, believes the project is“too big, too much, and too expensive.”“Yes, we need affordable housing, no question,”Engelken said.“It needs to be smaller to start with, it needs to have some ability to generate its own way, its own money.”Despite these concerns, the city council approved the project, but opposition efforts have led to a ballot measure that will let voters decide its fate in March.Broader Trends in Mountain TownsSteamboat Springsis not alone in this struggle. Other mountain and resort towns likeDriggs, Idaho, andWoodstock, New York, have experienced similar real estate booms. In Driggs, home prices have risen around 80% since the pandemic, while Woodstock has seen a 78% increase. The influx of buyers seeking more affordable alternatives to high-profile destinations has exacerbated these issues.Explore Driggs home pricesandWoodstock prices.Community Identity at StakeSteamboat’s identityas a small-town Western haven is at risk. The town, once known for its affordability compared to places like Vail, is now facing a real estate crisis. City Manager Gary Suiter notes that the town’s authentic charm is being challenged by these rapid changes.As the debate overBrown Ranchcontinues, the community must weigh the need for affordable housing against the preservation of its unique character. The outcome of the March ballot will be pivotal in shaping the future of this beloved“cowboy ski town.”Read More1410, 2024Hitting Home: Housing Affordability Crisis in the U.S.GalleryHitting Home: Housing Affordability Crisis in the U.S.Article,Economic Analysis,Housing AffordabilityHitting Home: Housing Affordability Crisis in the U.S.ByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T21:50:12-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Economic Analysis,Housing Affordability|Tags:Real Estate,Urban Development|0 Comments“`htmlHitting Home:Housing Affordability in the U.S.TheAmerican housing marketis grappling with a crisis ofaffordabilitythat is reshaping the landscape of homeownership and renting. A recent analysis byEconofacthighlights the growing burden ofhousing costson American households. With median house prices now six times the median income—up from four to five times two decades ago—the dream ofhomeownershipis slipping away for many. Even renters, who have historically found refuge in more affordable options, are feeling the pinch as the ratio ofmedian rentsto median income has crept from 25% to 30%.The Facts Behind the CrisisWorsening Affordability:Theaffordability crisisis not confined to coastal cities like San Francisco and New York. It is a nationwide issue, affecting both urban and rural areas.Cost-Burdened Households:A significant increase incost-burdened renters—those spending more than 30% of their income on housing—has been observed, particularly among those earning between $35,000 and $49,000 annually.Geographic Variations:Traditionally affordable regions are seeing rapid price appreciation, shrinking the affordability gap with historically expensive areas.The issue ofhousing affordabilityis compounded by a mix of demographic shifts and regulatory hurdles. The aging population, with more seniors opting toage in place, has contributed to a supply crunch. Meanwhile, zoning laws and other regulatory restrictions limit housing density, exacerbating the shortage. These factors, coupled with therise in mortgage ratesfrom 3.5% to nearly 8% since early 2022, have made the path tohomeownershipeven steeper.Hope on the Horizon?Despite the grim outlook, there are glimmers of hope. The anticipated reversal of the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle couldlower mortgage rates, easing the financial strain on households. Additionally, there are signs of change in urban zoning laws to allow more affordable housing construction. A surge inmultifamily housing startsand a large pipeline of apartments under construction may help relieve pressure on rents.The complexity of thehousing affordability crisissuggests there is no quick fix. However, with concerted efforts to increase supply and reform regulatory practices, there is potential for a more balanced and accessible housing market.“`Read More1410, 2024Ultra-Wealthy Buyers: Shaping the Future of Luxury Real EstateGalleryUltra-Wealthy Buyers: Shaping the Future of Luxury Real EstateArticle,Luxury Lifestyle,Real EstateUltra-Wealthy Buyers: Shaping the Future of Luxury Real EstateByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T21:26:16-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Luxury Lifestyle,Real Estate|Tags:Investment Strategy,Ultra-Wealthy Buyers|0 CommentsLuxury home pricesare soaring, with an 8.8% year-over-year increase in Q2 2024, according to aRedfin report.

Asremote workbecame the norm,office vacancy ratessoared to unprecedented levels, leaving many urban centers with empty office buildings. This shift has sparked a new trend: converting vacant office spaces into housing.According to areportfrom theCenter for American Progress, the United States is currently short 3.8 million housing units, and the adaptive reuse of office buildings is seen as a potential solution to this crisis. The report highlights that theBiden-Harris administrationsupports these conversions as a means to increase the housing supply while addressing the financial woes of commercial real estate owners.Challenges and OpportunitiesWhile converting office space into residential units offers potential benefits, it is not without challenges. The report emphasizes thatfinancing,building layout, andmarket conditionsare significant hurdles. Office buildings, especially those classified as Class B and C, often feature designs that are not conducive to residential use, lacking natural light and adequate plumbing for multiple units.Despite these challenges, there are notable examples of successful conversions. Cities likeLos AngelesandAlexandria, Virginia, have led the way in transforming office spaces into housing units. These cities have leveragedgovernment incentivesand streamlined zoning regulations to facilitate the conversions.Government InitiativesState and local governments are increasingly offering incentives to encourage office-to-housing conversions. For instance,Californiahas allocated $400 million for such projects, whileWisconsinhas introduced interest-free loans to support developers. These initiatives aim to address the affordable housing shortage and revitalize urban centers.At the federal level, theBiden-Harris administrationhas released a guidebook outlining programs to support these conversions. The administration is focused on ensuring that new residential properties are not only affordable but also energy-efficient, aligning with broader climate goals.RecommendationsTheCenter for American Progressreport offers several recommendations to enhance the feasibility of office-to-housing conversions. It suggests integrating these projects into mixed-use development plans, utilizing climate-focused financial resources, and exploring all viable options to increase the overall housing supply. These strategies aim to create vibrant, sustainable urban environments that meet the housing needs of the population.As cities continue to grapple with the dual challenges of office vacancies and housing shortages, the conversion of office spaces into residential units presents a promising opportunity. With the right incentives and strategic planning, these projects can play a crucial role in shaping the future of urban living.“`Read More1410, 2024Blockchain in Real Estate: A Revolution UnfoldsGalleryBlockchain in Real Estate: A Revolution UnfoldsArticle,Real Estate,TechnologyBlockchain in Real Estate: A Revolution UnfoldsByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T19:48:44-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Real Estate,Technology|Tags:Blockchain,Innovation|0 CommentsBlockchain in Real Estate: A Revolution UnfoldsThe real estate industry, long perceived as a bastion of tradition, is on the brink of a technological revolution.

With over 45 million U.S. households renting, many face severe financial strains due to high rental costs. TheCenter for American Progress’s reportdelves into potential solutions through local land-use reforms aimed at alleviating these pressures.The study reveals daunting statistics—nearly 11.2 million households spend over half their income on rent. This housing cost burden signals an urgent need for comprehensive strategies to ease financial pressures on renters and potential homeowners alike. The current housing market challenges, driven by historical zoning ordinances that limit affordable options, point to a reform path that could significantly alter the landscape.Local Land Use Reform as a Key SolutionThe push for reformingzoning lawsfocuses on expanding the supply of affordable housing by revisiting and updating restrictive local policies. Traditional zoning practices have long favored single-family homes, inadvertently fostering exclusion and driving up housing costs. By transitioning to more inclusive zoning codes, communities can potentially unlock a diverse range of housing solutions—without the reliance on federal or state subsidies.Federal Initiatives and Grassroots MovementsThe federal government’s proposed Building Opportunity program could be pivotal, offering financial incentives to jurisdictions that commit to significant zoning reforms. These reforms promise to open high-frequency transit corridors and urban areas to a variety of housing types, thus promoting greater accessibility and affordability.Cities like Minneapolis and states including Florida have already spearheaded initiatives to reduce zoning constraints, signaling a promising trend towards more affordable urban living solutions. The city eliminated parking mandates and expanded zoning to allow multifamily units, significantly transforming its housing landscape.Conclusion: A Path ForwardThis surge in regulatory reform is gaining momentum, evidenced by grassroots actions and the backing of federal incentives. As local governments begin dismantling barriers to affordable housing, the vision of a more inclusive and economically vibrant urban future becomes increasingly attainable.The ongoing conversation highlights the vital role of reforms in realizing equitable growth and alleviating the housing crisis that has gripped communities nationwide. As the Center for American Progress notes, these initiatives not only build opportunity but also play a central role in mitigating deep-rooted inequalities in housing availability and affordability.For more insights, read the full article onBuilding Opportunity: Expanding Housing in America by Reforming Local Land Use.—Read More1410, 2024How Blockchain is Revolutionizing Real Estate TransactionsGalleryHow Blockchain is Revolutionizing Real Estate TransactionsArticle,Blockchain Technology,Real EstateHow Blockchain is Revolutionizing Real Estate TransactionsByCameron Academy Author|2024-10-14T17:49:21-04:00October 14, 2024|Categories:Article,Blockchain Technology,Real Estate|Tags:Security,Transparency|0 CommentsBlockchain technology is set to revolutionize thereal estate industry, bringing unprecedented levels ofsecurityandtransparencyto property transactions.

The globalcyber insurance marketis projected to reach a staggering $90.6 billion by 2033, underscoring its escalating relevance.Challenges in CurrentCyber Insurance PoliciesDespite its necessity, many organizations find that theircyber insurance policiesare not working effectively. According to a 2023 Delinea report, there is a growing disconnect between carriers and enterprises, leading to numerous claims beingrejected. This issue is particularly prevalent among small businesses, which face an increase incyberattacksyet often remain uncertain about their coverage details.A striking example comes from a 2022 report by the UK’s Federation of Small Businesses, revealing that 38% of its members withcyber insurancedo not know what their policy includes. Furthermore, a recent study by Aviva found that only 17% of small businesses havecyber insurance, illustrating the widespread skepticism and lack of adoption in the sector.Barriers to Effective CoverageOne of the primary barriers to effectivecyber insurance coverageis the complexity and ambiguity of policy terms. Tarnveer Singh, CISO of The Exeter, highlighted that this can lead to disputes and delays duringcyber incidents, exacerbating stress and financial strain for policyholders.

IntroductionThe world is moving rapidly toward a digital future, raising questions and challenges for central banks. Digital technologies have advanced faster than any innovation in human history (Figures 1and2), and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this pace (Abidi, El-Herradi, and Sakha 2023). To keep up with this trend and harness its significant economic benefits, governments are adopting digitalization strategies to transform public services and increase their efficiency.1With payments becoming increasingly digitalized, one question is whether a structural shift from a reliance on cash to digital currencies could materialize. Many central banks are reflecting on how to achieve their policy objectives in this changing landscape. One option to preserve the key role of central bank-issued money in a digital world is to adopt a central bank digital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is a digital liability of the central bank used as a means of payment by the population (retail) or financial institutions (wholesale).View Full SizeFigure 1.Digital Ecosystems in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: International Telecommunication Union; and IMF staff calculations.Note: AE = advanced economy; CCA = Caucasus and Central Asia; EM = emerging market; GCC = Gulf Cooperation Council; ME&CA = Middle East and Central Asia; MENA = Middle East and North Africa; OE = oil exporter; Ol= oil importer.Download FigureDownload figure as PowerPoint slideAs of October 2023, 130 countries, representing 98 percent of global GDP, were exploring the potential use of a CBDC (Kosse and Mattei 2022).2,3A survey of IMF country teams representing 31 Middle East and Central Asia (ME&CA) economies4finds that 19 countries are considering or exploring a CBDC. This is consistent with information from country authorities’ public statements (Figure 3). Most ME&CA countries interested in a CBDC are at the research stage, while a few are at the proof-of-concept5stage (Bahrain, Georgia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates). Kazakhstan is most advanced in its journey to CBDC, having initiated two pilots of the digital tenge (DT; NBK 2021;Handagama 2023). The region’s fragile and conflict-affected states (FCSs) and low-income countries (LICs) have expressed limited interest. Three country case studies (Jordan, Kazakhstan, Libya), each at different stages of CBDC exploration, can be found in Annex 4.View Full SizeFigure 2.Broadband Ecosystem in ME&CA(Per 100 inhabitants)Citation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: International Telecommunication Union; and IMF staff calculations.Note: “Fixed broadband subscriptions” refers to fixed subscriptions to high-speed access to the public internet (a TCP/IP connection) at downstream speeds equal to or greater than 256 kbits per second. “Active mobile broadband subscriptions” refers to the sum of active handset-based and computer-based (USB/dongles) mobile broadband subscriptions that allow access to the internet.

The survey indicates that most ME&CA countries, especially those interested in financial inclusion (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic), are primarily interested in retail CBDCs. Hence, this paper will focus on retail CBDCs. A few countries are exploring wholesale CBDCs with local commercial banks and fintech partners (Saudi Arabia).6The key questions policymakers need to consider when exploring possible CBDC adoption are the following: What objectives do policymakers aim to achieve with a CBDC? Which inefficiencies in payment systems can CBDCs address? What are the implications of CBDC issuance for financial stability, monetary policy pass-through, and central bank operational risk? How can CBDC design help achieve policy objectives and mitigate these risks?Although there are no clear economic prerequisites to adopting a CBDC, the choice to issue a CBDC is complex and country dependent. Each country has different objectives, payment and financial systems, legal and regulatory frameworks, and central bank capacity. CBDCs are also a relatively new concept, with limited adoption and uptake to date, making it challenging to draw lessons from other countries. Hence, policymakers should approach CBDCs cautiously: successful implementation will require comprehensive analysis. In this respect, the IMF has been helping country authorities evaluate the need to issue a CBDC and establish strong policies and regulatory frameworks through capacity development. As of February 2023, seven ME&CA countries had received IMF capacity development on CBDC. In addition, the institution is leading the way with a significant number of analytical pieces,7including a comprehensive CBDC handbook guided by specific country capacity development questions on CBDC-related topics (IMF 2023b) (Box 1).Box 1.Capacity Development on Central Bank Digital CurrenciesThe IMF’s Digital Money Strategy, which the Executive Board endorsed in July 2021, gives the institution a mandate to help ensure that digital money fosters domestic and international economic and financial stability (IMF 2021a). The IMF has increased its analytical work and capacity development delivery on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The objective is to strengthen the capacity of member countries to assess, design, pilot, implement, and supervise CBDCs. Ultimately, both analytical work and capacity development delivery will contribute to country economic and financial stability and the stability of the international monetary system by making country payment systems and macrofinancial frameworks more resilient.In terms of analytical work, theIMF (2023d)released five chapters of theCBDC Virtual Handbookin November 2023. This handbook is a guide that aims to gather lessons learned and develop frameworks and guidance for member countries. It is meant to be a reference for policymakers and experts at central banks and finance ministries. This major project will generate about 20 chapters over the next five years, with four to five chapters being released per year. The chapter topics are chosen based on country needs and feasibility. The first set of chapters included a decision-making framework, a product development methodology, and implications for financial inclusion, monetary policy transmission, and capital flow management measures. The chapters will be updated regularly to reflect the latest developments and policies related to CBDCs. A second set of chapters will be published in 2024. Potential topics include financial stability; CBDC distribution, incentives, and adoption; cyber security; the relationship between CBDCs and other payment systems; cross-border payments; and implications for data frameworks and privacy protection.Regarding capacity development, the IMF works with countries through bilateral capacity development and regional workshops. The bilateral capacity development aims to provide tailored, practical, innovative, and technical advice to countries based on solid and thorough analysis and lessons learned from other countries. After capacity development delivery, countries should be better equipped to (1) understand the different uses, designs, ecosystem, and advantages and disadvantages of CBDCs; (2) understand the capacity, processes, and cost requirements involved in exploring and implementing CBDCs; (3) evaluate whether CBDCs are suitable for their economies given their specific goals, challenges, capacities, and the nature of their payment and financial sectors; (4) plan and test different stages of CBDC exploration, including creating prototypes and conducting trials to test specific policies; (5) design policies, such as regulations, to accompany CBDCs and promote financial inclusion and integrity; and (6) understand and prepare for any potential effects that their CBDC or a CBDC from another country may have on their economy. More than 30 bilateral capacity development and regional workshops have taken place, with a quarter of them focusing on Middle East and Central Asia countries. In June 2023, the IMF and Morocco co-hosted a high-level policy discussion on CBDCs to share knowledge and information among Middle East and Central Asia countries.The IMF has been actively participating in international working groups within the Group of Twenty and the Group of Seven to study how CBDCs can be used for cross-border transfers. They are exploring new ways to improve cross-border payments by analyzing innovative solutions, such as multilateral platforms, that use innovative technology to connect payments between countries using CBDCs and traditional payment systems. The IMF and World Bank have developed an approach to provide technical assistance for cross-border payments. The IMF has identified specific areas where assistance can be most effective in achieving the goals outlined in the Group of Twenty Roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments while safeguarding the integrity of the financial system.2. CBDC ObjectivesWhat objectives do policymakers hope to achieve by adopting a CBDC? Country authorities have multifaceted reasons for exploring the adoption of CBDCs (see Annex 3 for a complete list debated in the literature). The survey of IMF ME&CA country teams identifies enhancingfinancial inclusionandpayment system efficiencyas the top priorities for exploring CBDCs in the ME&CA region (Table 1).8In Middle East and North Africa (MENA) oil exporters and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the motivation for exploring CBDCs is to make payments more efficient, both domestically and cross-border (for example, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) (Schickler 2022; Central Bank of United Arab Emirates 2023). In contrast, the top priority in Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) countries is to increase financial inclusion; improving payment system efficiency and promoting innovation in financial technology are also important objectives in this region. In Georgia, where the focus is on a CBDC’s potential to promote financial inclusion, the central bank has been actively researching CBDC capabilities, design, and potential use cases since 2020 and officially launched a limited access live pilot of the digital lari with Ripple Labs through the cutting-edge Ripple CBDC platform (National Bank of Georgia 2023). MENA oil importers (for example, Jordan) also rank promoting financial inclusion and the efficiency of payment systems as key motivations for exploring CBDCs (IMF 2022d).Several lower-middle-income countries have built national agendas focused on deepening financial inclusion. In June 2021, Uzbekistan’s first National Financial Inclusion Strategy (for 2021–23) identified promoting digital payments as a key priority. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan is also promoting digital banking and payments, revising and approving regulation that expands access to remote banking and provides for bank accounts to be opened remotely using digital identification (EBRD 2023).Table 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupSource: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.Table 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupCountry GroupMaking Payments More Efficient (cross-border)Making Payments More Efficient (domestic)Broadening Access to PaymentsIncreasing Financial InclusionMENA Oil Exporters✓✓MENA Oil Importers✓✓Caucasus and Central Asia✓✓Low-Income Countries✓Gulf Cooperation Council Countries✓✓Fragile and Conflict-Affected States✓✓Emerging Markets✓✓Source: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.View TableTable 1.Key CBDC Objectives by Country GroupCountry GroupMaking Payments More Efficient (cross-border)Making Payments More Efficient (domestic)Broadening Access to PaymentsIncreasing Financial InclusionMENA Oil Exporters✓✓MENA Oil Importers✓✓Caucasus and Central Asia✓✓Low-Income Countries✓Gulf Cooperation Council Countries✓✓Fragile and Conflict-Affected States✓✓Emerging Markets✓✓Source: IMF survey to country teams.Note: CBDC = central bank digital currency; MENA = Middle East and North Africa.3. Payment Systems and Benefits of CBDC in ME&CAUnderstanding payment systems and their inherent inefficiencies in the region will help ascertain the potential benefits of CBDCs and, specifically, whether CBDCs can help achieve the objectives of ME&CA policymakers to enhance financial inclusion and the efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems.A. Financial Inclusion and Payment Systems in ME&CAIn general, there is a low level of financial inclusion in ME&CA countries, though there is a marked divergence across the region. For example, access to bank accounts in ME&CA countries is lower than the global average, indicating a low level of financial inclusion (Figure 4, panel 1) (Cardarelli, Vera-Martin, and Lall 2022,Blancher and others, 2019). However, access to bank accounts is relatively higher in the GCC, while low-income Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP) countries have the lowest access. The percentage of the adult population with bank accounts ranges from 6 percent in Sudan to 90 percent in the Islamic Republic of Iran (Figure 4, panel 2). Access to bank accounts appears to correlate with countries’ income levels but remains well below the global average.Similarly, although the adoption of digital payment methods in ME&CA countries is progressing, there is considerable variation, and the region overall is behind other regions (Figure 5).9This heterogeneity in digital payment adoption could be attributed to several factors. The impact of the pandemic and the need for economic diversification have driven an increase in digital payments in the GCC countries (Economist Intelligence Unit 2020). Saudi Arabia has the fastest digital payments adoption rate thanks to a comprehensive digital payment strategy under its Vision 2030 development plan.10Within the MENA region, there is a wide discrepancy in the adoption of digital payments. Countries like the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have high levels of digital payment usage, with 85 percent, 73 percent, and 77 percent of adults utilizing digital payments in 2021, respectively. In contrast, countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have significantly lower adoption rates at 14 percent and 8 percent, respectively. This disparity in adoption rates may reflect the high cost of existing digital payment systems in some countries, which can exclude certain segments of the population. In the CCA, Kazakhstan is making significant progress in increasing digital payments, with the amount of non-cash payments increasing by 2.5 times in 2021 compared to 2019 (PwC 2023).Despite having a digitally savvy population, some ME&CA countries still heavily rely on cash for transac-tions.11Cash in circulation is particularly high in the region’s LICs and FCSs (Figure 6). For example, in Iraq and Mauritania, cash in circulation was about 26 percent of GDP in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In contrast, cash in circulation has been declining in the GCC, averaging only 5.4 percent of GDP in 2021, reflecting the region’s digital advancement.View Full SizeFigure 4.Account Ownership, 2021(Percent of adults over age 15)Citation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Global Financial Inclusion database 2021;and IMF staff calculations.Note: Data labels in the figure use International Organization for Standardization (ISO) country codes.

The region’s informal sector plays a substantial role in the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and employing about 65 percent of the labor force. Only about one-third of retail transactions are conducted electronically in the region. This high reliance on cash is also due to tax and loan debt evasion, concealment of the intended use of money, underbanked consumer and merchant segments, a cultural bias toward cash, low wealth, and lack of trust in financial institutions (Figure 7) (Abidi and others 2023;Gatti and others 2014;Chan and others 2021).View Full SizeFigure 6.Reliance on Cash in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Haver Analytics; ILOSTAT database; national authorities; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Cash ratios are computed as currency in circulation divided by nominal GDP.

Remittance flows to ME&CA countries reached $447 billion in 2021, dwarfng other high-volume flows such as portfolio investment and official development assistance. However, the most common way to send and receive domestic remittances is still by another person using cash (Figure 8, panel 2).12The opposite is true in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, where account-based remittance transfers are most common, followed by those from money transfer operators. Cost does not seem to be a key impediment since the cost of remittances across all corridors and providers from the MENA region to receiving countries is below the global and sub-Saharan Africa averages (Figure 8, panels 3 and 4).View Full SizeFigure 8.Remittances in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: IMF, Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics database; World Bank, Remittance Prices Worldwide; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Sent or received domestic remittances: using an account (percent age 15+).

Benefits of CBDCs in ME&CACBDCs can help policymakers achieve their primary objectives of enhancing financial inclusion and payment system efficiency (domestic and cross-border) if they can address the inherent gaps in current systems.Financial InclusionCBDCs have the potential to advance financial inclusion by creating more competition for consumers and allowing for transactions to be settled more directly through reduced intermediation, thereby lowering the cost of financial services and making them more accessible. Unlike commercial banks, the lack of a profit motive by the central bank can also help keep costs lower. Considering that the financial system in the ME&CA region is heavily bank-dominated with a relatively high profit margin, CBDCs have the potential to advance financial inclusion.CBDCs could also help enhance the service quality for payment service providers (PSPs) and spur further innovation in the digital payment system by simplifying market entry for PSPs and removing the need for negotiations to access specific payment infrastructures and banking services. Similar effects could be achieved through policy reforms that enable nonbank entities to access central bank accounts and provide risk-based, fair, and transparent access to critical payment infrastructures, as seen in the case of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, given that a CBDC would carry the safety of central bank money and legal tender status, it could help overcome distrust in financial services and broaden access. CBDCs could also provide the needed technological infrastructure from scratch (a “clean slate”) if it does not already exist; hence, providing a public good that may be particularly relevant for LICs and FCSs, which may lack such infrastructure and where the share of the underserved population is particularly high.Payment SystemsCBDCs have the potential to help improve the efficiency of payment systems, both domestic and cross-border. By spurring competition in the domestic payment market, CBDCs can lower costs and update legacy technology platforms. As for cross-border payment systems, these are prone to various frictions, such as fragmented and truncated data formats across regions, complex processing of compliance checks, limited operating hours across jurisdictions, lack of payment system interoperability (due to differences in domestic legislation), and legacy technology platforms. These frictions result in high fees due to multiple intermediaries (correspondent banking) and a lack of guarantee as to whether the funds have been received in full (that is, finality). CBDCs could simplify the intermediation chains and increase availability (as they would operate on a 24/7 basis) by starting a “clean slate” system designed to achieve interoperability between different jurisdictions and allowing for real-time payment service (BIS, IMF, and World Bank 2021). The United Arab Emirates’ mBridge project is a good example for aiming to resolve these inefficiencies with wholesale CBDCs.By improving the efficiency of cross-border payments, CBDCs could also enable the flow of international remittances. This, in turn, can play an essential role in supporting economic development and financial inclusion.13CCA and MENA oil-importing economies, considering their high reliance on cash, including for remittances, could reap significant gains from improving the efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems. Cheaper and more accessible remittances will benefit senders and recipients, help buffer economic shocks, and stimulate growth.Despite the potential of CBDCs to improve financial inclusion and improve payments systems efficiency, it is crucial to recognize that CBDCs are not a panacea. Therefore, policymakers should conduct a comprehensive analysis of the various alternatives as some of the benefits of CBDCs could be achieved through other means. For example, facilitating the entry of new players in the market and providing comprehensive regulation and supervision of the entities to uphold the stability and integrity of the payment system can also improve competition. Increased competition could also occur through improved access to central bank accounts by PSPs, to avoid intermediaries in payment services provision.CBDCs may also not be able to overcome existing barriers to financial inclusion, such as those due to limited identification and financial literacy, low wealth, and high informality, which tend to be associated with a strong preference for physical cash. Regarding cross-border payments, some regional initiatives are already addressing inefficiencies by fostering payment system interoperability. Specifically, the GCC Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and the Arab Regional Payment System aim to streamline intraregional payment flows and improve the cross-border payment ecosystem (Box 2). In addition, CBDCs could coexist with other payment systems already in place and are not an either/or solution.Box 2.Improving Cross-Border Payment SystemsGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Real-Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS)Led by the six central banks of the GCC (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates)What will it do?The GCC RTGS will provide an overarching regional payment system connecting the individual domestic RTGS payment systems of each of the six GCC countries, enabling an efficient delivery of intra-GCC payments in the fiat currencies of the six countries. For example, a Saudi riyal payment originated in the United Arab Emirates and destined for a beneficiary in Saudi Arabia would occur over the domestic United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabian payment systems, instead of relying on bilateral correspondent banking frameworks.What are the benefits?The GCC RTGS would create standardization, drive efficiency, bring predictability, and reduce costs, as cross-border payments would previously be delivered using domestic payment system architecture. This would bring the experience of a pan-regional cross-border payment closer to that of a domestic payment.Arab Regional Payment System (known as BUNA)Led by the Arab Monetary FundWhat will it do?The system aims to create a central routing agent to provide a standardized payment experience across the Arab countries. With a common set of operating rules and a standardized SWIFT platform, BUNA would bring together the markets of the GCC and the Middle East and North Africa for all intraregional payments, covering not just the fiat currencies of the Arab countries but also key principally traded currencies such as the US dollar and euro.What are the benefits?Already “live” with the Emirati dirham, Egyptian pound, and Saudi Arabian riyal, BUNA is looking to augment currencies, countries, and commercial bank participation over the near to medium term to provide efficiency and standardization to intraregional cross-border payments. Soon, BUNA aims to enhance the platform further by introducing instant and real-time delivery of pan-regional cross-border payments and providing the foundation to support other financial market infrastructure.Sources: Arab Monetary Fund; andChan and others (2021).4. Financial Systems and Financial Stability Implications of CBDCs in ME&CAUnderstanding ME&CA financial systems will help to ascertain how CBDCs may affect financial stability in the ME&CA region. The relatively healthy financial systems in the region could support CBDC adoption. However, a country-specific analysis is paramount, including given the heterogeneity of financial systems across the region.A. ME&CA Financial SystemsME&CA financial systems are primarily dominated by banks (Figure 9). Nonbank financial institutions— pension funds, asset management and finance companies, and insurance—are underdeveloped in the region and are generally not involved in credit intermediation. Banks’ total assets reached $2.4 trillion in 2021 (185 percent of GDP), up from $1.7 trillion in 2016 (149 percent of GDP).14,15Still, there is significant heterogeneity across the region.In the GCC, financial systems are large, having grown in recent years thanks to buoyant economic activity fueled by large hydrocarbon proceeds and abundant liquidity. At the end of 2021, banks’ lending to GDP reached $2.7 trillion (or 198 percent of non-oil GDP) compared to other emerging markets (44 percent of GDP). Bahrain (the smallest GCC economy) ranks first in terms of banking system size with a ratio of banking system assets to non-oil GDP of 552 percent, while Saudi Arabia (by far the largest economy in the region) has the smallest ratio of banking system assets to non-oil GDP of 100 percent.Financial sectors in the CCA region are relatively small and underdeveloped. Georgia has the largest banking sector in the region and is close to the global average of emerging markets, as measured by banking system assets to GDP. In contrast, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan have relatively small banking sectors, less than half the size of the average banking sector in the region.Banking systems in the MENAP region are relatively heterogeneous. Jordan and Morocco have the largest banking sectors within this subregion. Despite the relative size of the economy, Pakistan’s banking sector is relatively small (47 percent of banking system assets to GDP).View Full SizeFigure 9.Bank Asset Structure in ME&CACitation: Departmental Papers 2024, 004;10.5089/9798400263798.087.A001Sources: Fitch Connect; and IMF staff calculations.Note: Figure uses 2021 values.

==================== COMMON AGENT ANSWER ====================
The introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is poised to have significant impacts on the traditional banking system and financial stability over the next five years. Here are some key considerations based on the available reference materials:

1. **Impact on Traditional Banking:**
   - **Bank Disintermediation:** CBDCs could potentially lead to disintermediation of traditional banks, as consumers might prefer holding CBDCs directly with central banks over traditional bank deposits. This could lead to reduced bank deposits, affecting banks' ability to lend and potentially increasing their reliance on equity and wholesale funding (Cameron Academy, European Economy).
   - **Competition and Innovation:** CBDCs could spur competition in the payment market by lowering costs and encouraging innovation. They might simplify access to financial services and open the market for new players, including fintech companies, to offer innovative payment solutions (IMF, European Economy).
   - **Role of Banks:** Banks might play a different role in distributing CBDCs, potentially acting as intermediaries in a two-tier system where they distribute CBDCs issued by the central bank. This could impact their revenue models and necessitate adaptation to new operational roles (Cameron Academy, European Economy).

2. **Financial Stability:**
   - **Monetary Policy Transmission:** CBDCs could enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy by providing central banks with better tools to control the money supply directly. This could lead to more efficient monetary policy transmission and potentially enhance financial stability (Cameron Academy).
   - **Risk Management:** There are concerns regarding the operational risks for central banks managing CBDCs, including cybersecurity threats and privacy issues. Effective implementation will require robust cybersecurity frameworks and privacy measures to maintain trust and security (Cameron Academy, IMF).
   - **Cross-Border Transactions:** CBDCs could improve the efficiency of cross-border payments by reducing costs and processing times, thus potentially enhancing financial stability by facilitating international trade and reducing transaction frictions (IMF).

3. **Regulatory and Policy Frameworks:**
   - To ensure a balanced impact on financial stability, comprehensive regulatory frameworks will be needed. These frameworks should address issues such as cybersecurity, data privacy, and the interoperability of CBDCs with existing financial systems (Cameron Academy, European Economy).

In conclusion, while CBDCs offer opportunities for improving payment systems and financial inclusion, their introduction will require careful consideration of their impacts on traditional banking and financial stability. Policymakers will need to address potential risks through robust regulatory frameworks and ensure that the benefits of CBDCs are realized without undermining the existing financial system.
