Search for the information of a AI researcher Qinyu Luo
You previously considered this question too complex and requiring a web search. Now, please design an appropriate search query to help you answer the user’s question.

In addition, here are various search engine techniques along with their corresponding use cases:
1. Using Quotation Marks for Exact Search ("")
Enclose your search terms within double quotes to search for the exact phrase. The results will display pages containing the exact phrase in the specified order. If no or few results are found, related results may be shown.
Example: Searching for "cats and dogs" will return results for the exact term "cats and dogs".
2. Using Tilde for Semantically Similar Terms (~"")
Use a tilde and double quotes to find results that are semantically similar to a given phrase. This includes variations in word order or synonyms.
Example: Searching for ~"cats and dogs" may return results like "cats & dogs", "dogs and cats", and "cats and dogs".
3. Using Hyphens to Exclude Content (-)
Use a hyphen before a word to exclude results containing that word. This is helpful when you want to filter out specific content.
Example: Searching for cats -dogs will return results about cats but with fewer references to dogs.
4. Using Plus to Include More Results for a Term (+)
Use a plus sign before a word to prioritize results containing that word.
Example: Searching for cats +dogs will return results with more emphasis on "dogs".
5. Searching for Specific File Types (filetype:)
Use the filetype: operator to find files of a specific type. Supported file types include pdf, doc(x), xls(x), ppt(x), and html.
Example: Searching for cats filetype:pdf will return PDFs about cats.
6. Searching Within a Specific Website (site:)
Use the site: operator followed by a domain to search for content within a particular website.
Example: Searching for dogs site:example.com will display pages about dogs from example.com.
7. Excluding a Specific Website (-site:)
Use the -site: operator to exclude a specific domain from the results.
Example: Searching for cats -site:example.com will return pages about cats but exclude those from example.com.
8. Searching for Terms in Titles (intitle:)
Use the intitle: operator to find pages where the title includes the specified word.
Example: Searching for intitle:dogs will return pages with "dogs" in the title.
9. Searching for Terms in URLs (inurl:)
Use the inurl: operator to find pages where the URL includes the specified word.
Example: Searching for inurl:cats will return pages where the URL includes the word "cats".

Please ensure you properly break down the user’s question into different levels of relevant queries to obtain more comprehensive and in-depth search results and also taking fully usage of these searching techniques to better assist your query design.

Such documentation serves as the cornerstone for understanding, maintaining, and enhancing the codebase. It provides essential context and rationale for the code, making it easier for current and future developers to comprehend the purpose, functionality, and structure of the software. It not only facilitates current and future developers in grasping the project's purpose and structure but also ensures that the project remains accessible and modifiable over time, significantly easing the learning curve for new team members.Traditionally, creating and maintaining software documentation demanded significant human effort and expertise, a challenge for small teams without dedicated personnel. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT has transformed this, enabling AI to handle much of the documentation process. This shift allows human developers to focus on verification and fine-tuning, greatly reducing the manual burden of documentation.🏆 Our goal is to create an intelligent document assistant that helps people read and understand repositories and generate documents, ultimately helping people improve efficiency and save time.✨ Features🤖 Automatically detects changes in Git repositories, tracking additions, deletions, and modifications of files.📝 Independently analyzes the code structure through AST, generating documents for individual objects.🔍 Accurate identification of inter-object bidirectional invocation relationships, enriching the global perspective of document content.📚 Seamlessly replaces Markdown content based on changes, maintaining consistency in documentation.🕙 Executes multi-threaded concurrent operations, enhancing the efficiency of document generation.👭 Offer a sustainable, automated documentation update method for team collaboration.😍 Display Code Documentation in an amazing way. (with document book per project powered by Gitbook)🚀 Getting StartedInstallation MethodUsing GitHub ActionsThis repository supports GitHub Actions for automating workflows such as building, testing, and deploying.

Default:Chinese-ll,--log-level[DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL]: Sets the logging level for the application. Default:INFOYou can also try the following featurerepoagent clean#Remove repoagent-related cacherepoagent diff#Check what docs will be updated/generated based on current code changeIf it's your first time generating documentation for the target repository, RepoAgent will automatically create a JSON file maintaining the global structure information and a folder named Markdown_Docs in the root directory of the target repository for storing documents.Once you have initially generated the global documentation for the target repository, or if the project you cloned already contains global documentation information, you can then seamlessly and automatically maintain internal project documentation with your team by configuring thepre-commit hookin the target repository!Usepre-commitRepoAgent currently supports generating documentation for projects, which requires some configuration in the target repository.First, ensure that the target repository is a git repository and has been initialized.git initInstall pre-commit in the target repository to detect changes in the git repository.pip install pre-commitCreate a file named.pre-commit-config.yamlin the root directory of the target repository. An example is as follows:repos:
-repo:localhooks:
-id:repo-agentname:RepoAgententry:repoagentlanguage:systempass_filenames:false#prevent from passing filenames to the hook#You can specify the file types that trigger the hook, but currently only python is supported.types:[python]For specific configuration methods of hooks, please refer topre-commit.
After configuring the yaml file, execute the following command to install the hook.pre-commit installIn this way, each git commit will trigger the RepoAgent's hook, automatically detecting changes in the target repository and generating corresponding documents.
Next, you can make some modifications to the target repository, such as adding a new file to the target repository, or modifying an existing file.
You just need to follow the normal git workflow: git add, git commit -m "your commit message", git push
The RepoAgent hook will automatically trigger at git commit, detect the files you added in the previous step, and generate corresponding documents.After execution, RepoAgent will automatically modify the staged files in the target repository and formally submit the commit. After the execution is completed, the green "Passed" will be displayed, as shown in the figure below:The generated document will be stored in the specified folder in the root directory of the target warehouse. The rendering of the generated document is as shown below:We utilized the default modelgpt-3.5-turboto generate documentation for theXAgentproject, which comprises approximately270,000 linesof code. You can view the results of this generation in the Markdown_Docs directory of the XAgent project on GitHub. For enhanced documentation quality, we suggest considering more advanced models likegpt-4-1106orgpt-4-0125-preview.In the end, you can flexibly adjust the output format, template, and other aspects of the document by customizing the prompt. We are excited about your exploration of a more scientific approach to Automated Technical Writing and your contributions to the community.Exploring chat with repoWe conceptualizeChat With Repoas a unified gateway for these downstream applications, acting as a connector that links RepoAgent to human users and other AI agents.

CONTENT: Previously, we demonstrated a nickel-catalyzed reductive 2-pyridination of aryl iodides with difluoromethyl 2-pyridyl sulfone (2-PySO2CF2H) via selective C(sp2)–S bond cleavage of the sulfone by using a phosphine ligand. This method employs readily available nickel catalyst and 2-PySO2CF2H as the difluoromethylation reagent, providing a facile access to difluoromethylarenes under mild reaction conditions without pre-generation of arylmetal reagents. Herein, highly controllable single and double CF2 insertions into CuCF2H species with a TMSCF2Br reagent have been described, affording two previously unknown fluoroalkylcopper species "Cu(CF2)nCF2H" (n = 1 and 2) independently under different reaction conditions. In this review, the synthesis of fluorinated alkenes through Julia and Julia-Kocienski reactions are summarized, and the contents are categorized by target molecules and sulfone reagents.

==================== COMMON AGENT ANSWER ====================
Qinyu Luo is an AI researcher with a focus on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning methodologies. Luo is notably recognized for co-authoring the paper "RepoAgent: An LLM-Powered Open-Source Framework for Repository-level Code Documentation Generation," which was presented at the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. The paper, co-authored with Yining Ye, Shihao Liang, and others, is available on platforms like the ACL Anthology.

**RepoAgent Framework:**
The framework introduced in Luo's paper, RepoAgent, leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation, maintenance, and updating of code documentation at the repository level. While the specifics of RepoAgent's impact or efficacy aren't detailed in the available sources, the framework's design aims to enhance the quality and efficiency of documentation processes in software development, suggesting potential improvements in reducing manual documentation efforts and increasing accuracy and consistency in documentation across projects.

**Other Research Contributions:**
Aside from RepoAgent, Luo has contributed to research in environmental science, as evidenced by a publication on urban park attributes predicting plant diversity and composition in Beijing, China. This interdisciplinary work, co-authored with Xiaopeng Li, Xiaolu Li, and others, showcases Luo's ability to apply machine learning methodologies beyond the traditional AI domain.

**Professional Affiliations and Online Presence:**
Qinyu Luo maintains an active presence on GitHub under the username LOGIC-10, where the profile indicates Luo's affiliation with the THUNLP Lab and as a student at Johns Hopkins University.

Title: [2410.12361] Proactive Agent: Shifting LLM Agents from Reactive Responses to Active Assistance
Content:
Computer Science > Artificial IntelligencearXiv:2410.12361(cs)[Submitted on 16 Oct 2024 (v1), last revised 3 Dec 2024 (this version, v3)]Title:Proactive Agent: Shifting LLM Agents from Reactive Responses to Active AssistanceAuthors:Yaxi Lu,Shenzhi Yang,Cheng Qian,Guirong Chen,Qinyu Luo,Yesai Wu,Huadong Wang,Xin Cong,Zhong Zhang,Yankai Lin,Weiwen Liu,Yasheng Wang,Zhiyuan Liu,Fangming Liu,Maosong SunView a PDF of the paper titled Proactive Agent: Shifting LLM Agents from Reactive Responses to Active Assistance, by Yaxi Lu and 14 other authorsView PDFHTML (experimental)Abstract:Agents powered by large language models have shown remarkable abilities in solving complex tasks. However, most agent systems remain reactive, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios requiring foresight and autonomous decision-making. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of developing proactive agents capable of anticipating and initiating tasks without explicit human instructions. We propose a novel data-driven approach for this problem. Firstly, we collect real-world human activities to generate proactive task predictions. These predictions are then labeled by human annotators as either accepted or rejected. The labeled data is used to train a reward model that simulates human judgment and serves as an automatic evaluator of the proactiveness of LLM agents. Building on this, we develop a comprehensive data generation pipeline to create a diverse dataset, ProactiveBench, containing 6,790 events. Finally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning models with the proposed ProactiveBench can significantly elicit the proactiveness of LLM agents. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model achieves an F1-Score of 66.47% in proactively offering assistance, outperforming all open-source and close-source models. These results highlight the potential of our method in creating more proactive and effective agent systems, paving the way for future advancements in human-agent collaboration.Comments:9 pages, 4 figuresSubjects:Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL)ACMclasses:I.2.7Cite as:arXiv:2410.12361[cs.AI](orarXiv:2410.12361v3[cs.AI]for this version)https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.12361Focus to learn morearXiv-issued DOI via DataCiteSubmission historyFrom: Yaxi Lu [view email][v1]Wed, 16 Oct 2024 08:24:09 UTC (356 KB)[v2]Wed, 27 Nov 2024 10:14:54 UTC (332 KB)[v3]Tue, 3 Dec 2024 04:34:09 UTC (333 KB)Full-text links:Access Paper:View a PDF of the paper titled Proactive Agent: Shifting LLM Agents from Reactive Responses to Active Assistance, by Yaxi Lu and 14 other authorsView PDFHTML (experimental)TeX SourceOther Formatsview licenseCurrent browse context:cs.AI< prev|next >new|recent|2024-10Change to browse by:cscs.CLReferences & CitationsNASA ADSGoogle ScholarSemantic Scholaraexport BibTeX citationLoading...BibTeX formatted citation×loading...Data provided by:BookmarkBibliographic ToolsBibliographic and Citation ToolsBibliographic Explorer ToggleBibliographic Explorer(What is the Explorer?)Connected Papers ToggleConnected Papers(What is Connected Papers?)Litmaps ToggleLitmaps(What is Litmaps?)scite.ai Togglescite Smart Citations(What are Smart Citations?)Code, Data, MediaCode, Data and Media Associated with this ArticlealphaXiv TogglealphaXiv(What is alphaXiv?)Links to Code ToggleCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers(What is CatalyzeX?)DagsHub ToggleDagsHub(What is DagsHub?)GotitPub ToggleGotit.pub(What is GotitPub?)Huggingface ToggleHugging Face(What is Huggingface?)Links to Code TogglePapers with Code(What is Papers with Code?)ScienceCast ToggleScienceCast(What is ScienceCast?)DemosDemosReplicate ToggleReplicate(What is Replicate?)Spaces ToggleHugging Face Spaces(What is Spaces?)Spaces ToggleTXYZ.AI(What is TXYZ.AI?)Related PapersRecommenders and Search ToolsLink to Influence FlowerInfluence Flower(What are Influence Flowers?)Core recommender toggleCORE Recommender(What is CORE?)AuthorVenueInstitutionTopicAbout arXivLabsarXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaboratorsarXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?Learn more about arXivLabs.Which authors of this paper are endorsers?|Disable MathJax(What is MathJax?)
