        "**CriticAgent**: The function of CriticAgent is to generate critiques based on user questions and agent responses.\n\n**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.\n· original_task: A string that holds the user's original question or task.\n· critic_prompt: A template used for generating critiques, retrieved from the environment.\n· agent_answer: A string that stores the answer provided by the agent.\n\n**Code Description**: The CriticAgent class inherits from the BaseAgent class and is designed to facilitate the generation of critiques for agent responses to user questions. Upon initialization, it sets up the original task as an empty string and retrieves a template for critiques from the environment, specifically from a file named 'critic_agent.txt'. \n\nThe class contains several methods:\n- The `__init__` method initializes the instance of the CriticAgent, setting up the original task and loading the critique template.\n- The `critic` method is responsible for generating a critique. It first gathers the necessary data by calling the `get_data_for_critic` method, which collects the user's question and the agent's answer. It then utilizes the `chat_with_template` method to interact with the critique template and obtain a response from the model. The response is expected to be in YAML format, which is validated and formatted. If the response contains invalid YAML, an error message is printed, and the method returns None.\n- The `receive_agent_answer` method allows the CriticAgent to store the agent's answer for later critique.\n- The `get_data_for_critic` method constructs and returns a dictionary containing the original user question and the agent's answer, which is essential for generating the critique.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the agent's answer is properly received before invoking the `critic` method, as the critique generation relies on this data. Additionally, users should handle potential YAML errors gracefully when utilizing the `critic` method.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `critic` method could be a formatted YAML string such as:\n```yaml\ncritique:\n  - feedback: \"The response was clear and concise.\"\n  - suggestions:\n      - \"Consider providing more examples.\"\n      - \"Ensure to address all parts of the user's question.\"\n```",
        "**CriticAgent**: The function of CriticAgent is to generate critiques based on user questions and agent responses.\n\n**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.\n· original_task: A string that holds the original user question or task to be critiqued.  \n· critic_prompt: A template used for generating critiques, retrieved from the environment.  \n· agent_answer: A string that stores the answer provided by the agent for critique.  \n\n**Code Description**: The CriticAgent class inherits from the BaseAgent class and is designed to facilitate the process of generating critiques for agent responses. Upon initialization, it sets up an empty string for the original task and retrieves a template for the critique from the environment. The main functionality of this class is encapsulated in the `critic` method, which generates a critique based on the original task and the agent's answer.\n\nThe `critic` method first gathers the necessary data by calling `get_data_for_critic`, which compiles the original task and the agent's answer into a dictionary. This data is then passed to the `chat_with_template` method along with the critique prompt to simulate a conversation where the model acts as a user providing a response. The generated response is appended to the history with the role of \"critic_user\".\n\nAfter obtaining the model's response, the method attempts to extract and validate the response as YAML format using the `extract_and_validate_yaml` method. If the response is valid YAML, it is returned; otherwise, an error message is printed, and the method returns None.\n\nThe `receive_agent_answer` method allows the class to accept an answer from the agent, storing it in the `agent_answer` attribute. The `get_data_for_critic` method constructs a dictionary containing the original task and the agent's answer, which is essential for generating the critique.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the agent's answer is properly formatted and relevant to the original task for the critique to be meaningful. Additionally, users should handle potential YAML parsing errors gracefully.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `critic` method could be a structured YAML response such as:\n```yaml\ncritique:\n  feedback: \"The agent's response was clear and concise.\"\n  suggestions:\n    - \"Consider providing more examples.\"\n    - \"Clarify the main points for better understanding.\"\n```"

It first invokes the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, it initializes an instance variable `original_task` to an empty string, which is likely intended to hold a description or identifier of the task that the agent will be working on. Additionally, it initializes another instance variable `critic_prompt` by calling `self.env.get_template('critic_agent.txt')`. This line suggests that the CriticAgent class is associated with an environment that can retrieve templates, and it specifically loads a template named 'critic_agent.txt'. This template may be used later in the class for generating prompts or responses related to the critic agent's functionality.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the environment (`self.env`) is properly set up before this constructor is called, as it relies on the `get_template` method to function correctly. Additionally, the `original_task` variable should be assigned a meaningful value before it is used in any operations to avoid issues with uninitialized data."

        "**critic**: The function of critic is to generate a review based on user input and agent responses.\n\n**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.\n· There are no parameters for this function.\n\n**Code Description**: The critic method is a member of the CriticAgent class, responsible for producing a critique based on the interaction between the user and the agent. It begins by invoking the get_data_for_critic method, which retrieves essential data in the form of a dictionary containing the user's question and the agent's answer. This data is then passed to the chat_with_template method along with a predefined prompt (self.critic_prompt) to generate a model response.\n\nThe expected output from chat_with_template is a string formatted in YAML. The critic method subsequently attempts to validate and format this YAML content using the extract_and_validate_yaml method. If the YAML content is valid, it is returned as the output of the critic method. However, if a YAMLError occurs during this validation process, an error message is printed to the console, and the method returns None.\n\nThe relationship between critic and its callees is crucial for its functionality. The get_data_for_critic method provides the necessary context for the critique by supplying the user question and agent answer. The chat_with_template method is responsible for generating the critique based on this context, while extract_and_validate_yaml ensures that the output is in a valid format. This structured flow ensures that the critique process is both systematic and reliable.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the instance variables self.original_task and self.agent_answer are properly initialized before calling this function to avoid returning None or causing errors in the subsequent processing.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the critic method could be a well-structured YAML string, such as:\n```yaml\nreview:\n  user_question: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n  agent_answer: \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n  critique: \"The answer is accurate and concise.\"\n```",

It begins by calling the get_data_for_critic method, which retrieves the original user question and the agent's answer in a structured format. This data is essential for creating a meaningful critique.\n\nOnce the data is obtained, the method utilizes the chat_with_template function, passing in the retrieved data along with a predefined prompt stored in self.critic_prompt. This function is expected to simulate a conversation where the model generates a response based on the provided input.\n\nThe response from chat_with_template is then appended to the instance variable self.history, with the role labeled as \"critic_user\". This allows for tracking the conversation history, which may be useful for future reference or analysis.\n\nFollowing this, the method attempts to extract and validate the response as YAML formatted content using the extract_and_validate_yaml function. If the response is valid YAML, it is returned by the critic method. However, if a yaml.YAMLError occurs during this process, an error message is printed to the console indicating that the YAML content is invalid, and the method returns None.\n\nThe critic method thus plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the CriticAgent class by facilitating the generation of critiques based on user-agent interactions, ensuring that the critiques are formatted correctly and maintaining a history of the interactions.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the instance variables self.original_task, self.agent_answer, and self.critic_prompt are properly initialized before calling this function to avoid returning None or causing errors in the subsequent processing.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the critic method could be a well-structured YAML representation of the critique, such as:\n```yaml\nreview:\n  feedback: \"The agent's response was accurate and concise.\"\n  suggestions:\n    - \"Consider providing more examples.\"\n    - \"Clarify the context of the question.\"\n```"

The value for 'user_question' is obtained from the instance variable self.original_task, which presumably holds the question posed by the user. The value for 'agent_answer' is derived from another instance variable, self.agent_answer, which likely contains the response generated by the agent to the user's question.\n\nThis function is called within the critic method of the same class.

Additionally, proper error handling is implemented to manage potential issues with YAML formatting.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a string representing a valid YAML structure, such as:\n\n```yaml\nplan:\n  - step: \"Initialize the system\"\n    duration: \"5 minutes\"\n  - step: \"Gather data\"\n    duration: \"10 minutes\"\n  - step: \"Analyze data\"\n    duration: \"15 minutes\"\n``` \n\nIf an error occurs during the YAML extraction, the function would return `None`.",
        "**plan**: The function of plan is to generate a structured plan based on the common agent's response and the critic's feedback.\n\n**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.\n· common_agent_answer: This parameter represents the response generated by the common agent, which is relevant to the user's query.\n· critic_feedback: This parameter captures the feedback provided by the critic, which is essential for refining the planning process.\n\n**Code Description**: The plan function is responsible for orchestrating the planning process by utilizing data from the common agent's response and the critic's feedback. Initially, it calls the get_data_for_plan method to compile the necessary data into a structured format. This data includes the original user question, the agent's answer, the feedback from the critic, and the search history. The output from get_data_for_plan is then passed to the chat_with_template method, which likely processes this data to generate a coherent response or plan based on a predefined template.\n\nAfter obtaining the model response from chat_with_template, the plan function appends this response to the history, maintaining a record of the interactions. The function then attempts to extract and validate the response as YAML format using the extract_and_validate_yaml method. If the response is valid YAML, it is returned to the caller. However, if a YAMLError occurs during this process, an error message is printed, and the function returns None, indicating that the planning process could not be completed successfully due to invalid YAML content.\n\nThis function is integral to the SearchPlanAgent class, as it consolidates various inputs into a coherent plan while ensuring that the output adheres to the expected format. The reliance on the get_data_for_plan method emphasizes the importance of structured data in the planning process, while the error handling for YAML validation ensures robustness in the function's operation.\n\n**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the parameters passed to the plan function are accurate and relevant, as they directly influence the quality of the generated plan. Proper error handling for YAML validation is also essential to prevent disruptions in the workflow.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a YAML-formatted string representing the plan, such as:\n\n```yaml\nplan:\n  steps:\n    - Identify key tasks\n    - Set deadlines\n    - Review progress regularly\n```"

For each parameter, the method checks if a description is available from the parsed docstring and constructs a dictionary of fields that define the parameter's type and properties.\n\nA dynamic model called `DynamicParameters` is created using the `create_model` function, which utilizes the collected fields. This model encapsulates the parameters' schema, allowing for structured representation.\n\nThe method then constructs a properties dictionary that maps each parameter name to its corresponding type and description. Finally, it builds a `Function` instance, which includes the function's name, description, and parameters schema. This `Function` instance is then wrapped in a `Tool` schema, which is returned as a serialized output using the `model_dump()` method.\n\nThe create_schema_from_function method is integral to the Tool class, as it allows for the dynamic generation of function schemas based on existing functions, facilitating the creation of tools that can execute these functions with well-defined parameters.\n\n**Note**: When using the create_schema_from_function method, ensure that the target_function provided has a well-defined signature and documentation string to generate an accurate schema. The method relies on the presence of parameter descriptions in the docstring to enhance the generated schema's clarity.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value of the create_schema_from_function method could look like this:\n{\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"example_function\",\n        \"description\": \"This function serves as an example.\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"param1\": {\n                    \"type\": \"int\",\n                    \"description\": \"An integer parameter.\"\n                },\n                \"param2\": {\n                    \"type\": \"str\",\n                    \"description\": \"A string parameter.\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"param1\"],\n            \"additionalProperties\": false\n        }\n    }\n}"

It begins by initializing an OpenAI client using the provided model name and configuration settings. The configuration includes essential parameters such as the API key, base URL, timeout, and maximum retries, which are retrieved from the config dictionary.\n\nNext, the function constructs a list of messages that includes both the system prompt and the user prompt. This structured format is necessary for the chat completion request to the API. The function then calls the chat completion method of the OpenAI client, passing in the model name, the constructed messages, and additional parameters like temperature and maximum tokens.\n\nUpon receiving the response from the API, the function extracts the content of the first message choice from the response object and returns it. This content represents the model's generated reply based on the provided prompts.\n\nThe call_llm function is invoked within the breakdown_task method of the Manager class in the agent_factory/manager.py file. In this context, it is used to break down a larger task into smaller sub-tasks by rendering a prompt and sending it to the language model for processing. The response from call_llm is then returned as the output of the breakdown_task method, indicating its role in task decomposition and interaction with the language model.\n\n**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the configuration dictionary is properly populated with all necessary keys and values to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, be mindful of the API usage limits and the potential costs associated with calling the OpenAI API.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the call_llm function could be a string such as \"To break down the task, consider the following steps: 1.

        "**call_llm**: The function of call_llm is to make an API request to a language model service, sending a system and user prompt, and returning the model's response.\n\n**parameters**: The parameters of this function.\n· model: The model name or identifier used for making the request to the language model service.\n· sys_prompt: A string that serves as the system message for the model, providing instructions or context for the conversation.\n· usr_prompt: A string that serves as the user's message or input for the model, to which the model should respond.\n· config: A dictionary containing configuration settings required for the request, including API keys, timeouts, retry settings, temperature, and model-specific settings.\n\n**Code Description**:  \nThe `call_llm` function is responsible for interfacing with a language model API (presumably OpenAI's API). It does so by creating a client instance for the OpenAI service using the configuration values passed in the `config` parameter. The function then constructs a list of messages that includes the system message (`sys_prompt`) and the user message (`usr_prompt`). This list is sent as part of the request to the `chat.completions.create` method of the API client.\n\nThe function retrieves the response from the API and extracts the model's reply from the `choices` list in the response. Specifically, it fetches the content of the message from the first choice in the list, which is assumed to be the relevant response from the model.\n\nKey steps in the process:\n1. An instance of the OpenAI client is created using the provided configuration values, including the API key, base URL, timeout, and retry settings.\n2. A list of messages is constructed, where the system message provides context or instructions, and the user message contains the query or input.\n3. The request is sent to the API, specifying the model, the messages, and other parameters like temperature.\n4. The model's response is extracted from the API's response and returned as the result.\n\nThe `call_llm` function is called within the `chat` method of the `BaseAgent` class in the `agent_factory/agent.py` module. In this context, it is used to send a dynamically rendered prompt to the language model based on the input data. The system and user prompts are provided as part of this interaction, and the function returns the model's response to be processed further or sent back to the user.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The `config` parameter must include valid API keys and any necessary configuration settings like `timeout`, `max_retries`, and `temperature` for the API request to be successful.\n- The function assumes the model will return a response in the form of a list of choices, with the actual message located in `response.choices[0].message`.\n- While the `max_tokens` parameter is mentioned in the code as a potential setting, it is commented out, implying it is either optional or controlled elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nThe return value of `call_llm` would typically be a string representing the content of the model's response. For example:\n\n```\n\"Sure, here's the information you requested: ... \"\n```",

The API key and base URL are extracted from the config dictionary based on the specified model, ensuring that the correct credentials and endpoint are used for the API call.\n\nThe function constructs a list of messages that includes both the system prompt and the user prompt. These messages are formatted as dictionaries, where each dictionary specifies the role (either \"system\" or \"user\") and the corresponding content. This structured format is essential for the language model to understand the context of the conversation.\n\nNext, the function calls the chat completion method of the OpenAI client, passing in the model identifier, the constructed messages, and additional parameters such as temperature. The temperature setting influences the randomness of the model's responses, allowing for more creative or focused outputs depending on the desired outcome.\n\nUpon receiving the response from the API, the function extracts the content of the first message choice returned by the model. This content represents the model's reply to the user prompt and is returned as the output of the call_llm function.\n\nThe call_llm function is invoked by the chat method of the BaseAgent class, which is responsible for generating user-specific prompts based on input data. The chat method renders a prompt template using the provided data and then calls call_llm with the necessary parameters. This relationship highlights the role of call_llm as a backend service that processes user interactions and generates responses from the language model.\n\n**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the configuration settings provided to the call_llm function are complete and valid to avoid errors during the API interaction. Additionally, the model specified must be supported by the OpenAI client to ensure successful communication.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the call_llm function could be a string such as \"Here is the information you requested based on your input: ...\"",

        "**BaseAgent**: The function of BaseAgent is to serve as a foundational class for agents that interact with a language model for chat-based functionalities.\n\n**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.\n· config: A configuration object that is read from a configuration file, containing various settings for the agent's operation.  \n· model: A string that specifies the default model to be used for generating responses, defaulting to \"gpt-4o-mini\".  \n· env: An instance of the Environment class used for loading templates from the file system, specifically for prompt management.  \n· sys_prompt: A string that holds the system prompt, initialized as an empty string, which can be used to set the context for the chat.  \n· repeat_turns: An integer that defines the number of times to repeat the task or interaction, defaulting to 10.\n\n**Code Description**: The BaseAgent class is designed to provide a common interface and functionality for agents that require interaction with a language model. Upon initialization, the class reads configuration settings from an external file, which includes the model to be used and the path to the prompt templates. The class sets up an environment for loading these templates, allowing for dynamic prompt generation based on the data provided during chat interactions.\n\nThe `chat` method is a core function of the BaseAgent class, which facilitates communication with the language model. It takes in a data dictionary and a prompt template, rendering the prompt with the provided data. The rendered prompt is then sent to a function called `call_llm`, which is responsible for interacting with the language model and generating a response based on the system prompt and user prompt.\n\nThe BaseAgent class is utilized by the Manager class, which inherits from it. The Manager class leverages the chat functionality of BaseAgent to break down tasks into sub-tasks. It initializes its own attributes while also inheriting the configuration and model settings from BaseAgent. This relationship allows the Manager to effectively utilize the chat method to interact with the language model for task management purposes.\n\n**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up and that the necessary template files are available in the specified prompt folder path. The `call_llm` function must also be properly defined elsewhere in the codebase to handle the interaction with the language model.\n\n**Output Example**: An example output from the `chat` method might look like this:\n```\n{\n    \"response\": \"Here are the steps to break down your task: Research the topic, Draft an outline, Write the introduction, Gather references.\",\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"message\": \"Response generated successfully.\"\n}\n```",

Upon initialization, it reads configuration settings, including the default model and the path for prompt templates. The class utilizes the Jinja2 templating engine to load prompts from the specified folder, allowing for dynamic prompt generation based on the provided data.\n\nThe primary method of interest in the BaseAgent class is `chat`, which takes in a data dictionary and a prompt template. This method renders the prompt using the provided data, enabling the customization of the prompt based on the specific context of the conversation. It then calls the `call_llm` function, passing the rendered prompt along with the system prompt and model configuration to obtain a response from the language model. This interaction is crucial for generating contextually relevant replies in a chat setting.\n\nAnother significant method is `receive_task`, which allows the agent to accept and store an original task. This method is essential for setting the context for subsequent operations, particularly in scenarios where the agent is expected to perform tasks based on the received input.\n\nThe BaseAgent class is inherited by the Manager class, which extends its functionalities to include task management capabilities. The Manager class utilizes the `receive_task` method to store the original task and employs the `chat` method to break down the task into sub-tasks. This relationship illustrates how the Manager class leverages the capabilities of the BaseAgent class to perform its task management functions effectively.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up with the necessary parameters, including the model and prompt folder path. Additionally, the interaction with the language model through the `chat` method relies on the correct implementation of the `call_llm` function, which must be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible output from the `chat` method might look like this:\n```\n{\n    \"response\": \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\",\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"message\": \"Chat initiated successfully.\"\n}\n```",

This method serves as the primary interface for generating responses based on user input.\n\nThe `chat_with_template` method allows for dynamic prompt generation by rendering a template with provided data. It utilizes the Jinja2 templating engine to create a customized prompt before passing it to the `common_chat` method for processing.\n\nThe `receive_task` method is used to accept and store an original task, which can be further processed or utilized in chat interactions.\n\nThe `extract_and_validate_yaml` method is responsible for extracting YAML content from a model's response. It uses regular expressions to find content wrapped in ```yaml``` tags and attempts to parse it using the PyYAML library. If successful, it returns the YAML content in a standardized format; otherwise, it handles errors gracefully by returning None.\n\n**Note**: When using the BaseAgent class, ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up with the necessary parameters, including the prompt folder path and the default model. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented when dealing with YAML content to avoid runtime exceptions.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `common_chat` method could be a string response from the language model, such as: \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\" If the `extract_and_validate_yaml` method is called with a valid model response containing YAML, it might return a formatted YAML string like:\n```yaml\nkey1: value1\nkey2: value2\n```",
        "**BaseAgent**: The function of BaseAgent is to serve as the foundational agent for performing tasks related to querying and processing information with a model, as well as managing related configurations and data structures.\n\n**attributes**:\n· `config`: A configuration object containing various settings loaded from a configuration file.  \n· `model`: A string specifying the default model to be used for interactions (defaults to \"gpt-4o-mini\").  \n· `env`: An Environment object initialized with a file system loader pointing to the prompt folder path defined in the configuration.  \n· `queryDB`: A set that stores queries. This set is used to hold each unique query issued by the agent.  \n· `citationDB`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a query and its associated citation data (only queries praised by the critic are included).  \n· `sys_prompt`: A string holding the system-level prompt used for guiding interactions with the model.  \n· `repeat_turns`: An integer specifying the maximum number of turns for repeating a task or conversation (defaults to 10).  \n· `original_task`: A placeholder for the original task that will be processed by the agent.\n\n**Code Description**:  \nThe `BaseAgent` class provides the essential functionality for interacting with an AI model and handling related tasks. It begins by initializing various attributes, such as loading configuration details, setting the default model to \"gpt-4o-mini\", and setting up a file-based environment for loading prompts. The agent also maintains a set `queryDB` to track all issued queries and a `citationDB` for storing search results with associated citations, ensuring that only specific search results are included (those deemed worthy by a critic).  \n\nThe `common_chat` method facilitates interaction with the model by taking a query and invoking a model with a predefined system prompt. The method `chat_with_template` is more flexible, allowing for dynamic generation of prompts from a provided template. It first renders the template using data passed to it and then passes the generated prompt to `common_chat`.  \n\nThe `receive_task` method stores the task passed to the agent, ensuring the agent can process it later. The `extract_and_validate_yaml` method is a utility for extracting and validating YAML-formatted data from the response returned by the model. It searches for a YAML block in the response and attempts to parse it, returning the valid YAML content in a human-readable format if the extraction is successful. If no valid YAML is found or an error occurs during parsing, the method returns `None`.  \n\n**Note**:  \n- The agent requires a properly structured configuration file to initialize correctly. \n- The `citationDB` is a critical component for maintaining the quality of search results.\n- The `repeat_turns` parameter limits the number of times an agent will reattempt a task.\n- `extract_and_validate_yaml` uses regular expressions to extract YAML content and relies on Python's `yaml` library for parsing.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nFor `common_chat`, a mock response might be:\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": \"The challenges faced by Google in 2019 included increasing competition, regulatory pressures, and internal company restructuring.\"\n}\n```\nFor `extract_and_validate_yaml`, a valid YAML block returned might look like:\n```yaml\nmodel: gpt-4o-mini\nconfig:\n  timeout: 30\n  retries: 3\n```",

        "**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the BaseAgent class by setting up its configuration and environment.\n\n**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.\n· None\n\n**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the BaseAgent class. It is called when an instance of the class is created. The method performs several key operations:\n\n1. It invokes the read_config function to load configuration settings from a YAML file. This function returns a dictionary containing various configuration parameters, which is stored in the instance variable self.config.\n\n2. The method retrieves the value associated with the key 'default_model' from the configuration dictionary. If this key is not present, it defaults to the string \"gpt-4o-mini\". This value is stored in the instance variable self.model, which likely represents the model that the agent will use for its operations.\n\n3. The method initializes an Environment object from the Jinja2 templating library. This object is configured with a loader that points to the directory specified by the 'prompt_folder_path' key in the configuration dictionary. This allows the agent to dynamically load prompt templates from the specified folder.\n\n4. The instance variable self.sys_prompt is initialized as an empty string, which may be used later to store system prompts or messages.\n\n5. Finally, the method sets self.repeat_turns to 10, which could indicate the number of times the agent is allowed to repeat certain actions or interactions during its operation.\n\nOverall, the __init__ method establishes the foundational settings and components necessary for the BaseAgent to function effectively. It relies on the read_config function to ensure that the agent is configured according to the specified settings in the YAML file, thus enabling flexibility and customization in its behavior.\n\n**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the YAML configuration file is accessible and correctly formatted. Any issues with file access or parsing may result in runtime errors, preventing the BaseAgent from initializing properly.",

It is responsible for setting up the initial state of an instance when it is created. The function performs the following actions:\n\n1. It calls the `read_config()` function to load configuration settings, which are stored in the `self.config` attribute. This configuration is essential for the agent's operation, as it contains various settings that dictate how the agent behaves.\n\n2. The `self.model` attribute is initialized with the value of the 'default_model' key from the configuration. If this key is not present, it defaults to \"gpt-4o-mini\". This model will likely be used for generating responses or processing queries.\n\n3. The `self.env` attribute is initialized as an instance of the `Environment` class, which is configured with a `FileSystemLoader`. The loader is set to the path specified by the 'prompt_folder_path' key in the configuration. This environment is likely used for loading templates or prompts that the agent will utilize.\n\n4. The `self.queryDB` attribute is initialized as an empty set. This set is intended to store unique queries that the agent will process. Using a set ensures that each query is distinct and prevents duplicates.\n\n5. The `self.citationDB` attribute is initialized with a list containing a single dictionary. This dictionary is structured to hold search questions as keys, with corresponding values that are themselves dictionaries. Each value dictionary contains a \"document_id\" key, which is a unique identifier for a document, along with placeholders for \"url\", \"title\", and \"content\". This structure is designed to store search results that have received positive feedback from critics.\n\n6. The `self.sys_prompt` attribute is initialized as an empty string. This prompt may be used to guide the agent's responses or behavior during interactions.\n\n7. The `self.repeat_turns` attribute is set to 10, indicating the number of times the agent may repeat a certain action or query during its operation.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up and accessible, as the agent relies heavily on the parameters defined within it. Additionally, the structure of `citationDB` should be maintained to ensure that the agent can effectively manage and reference search results.",

        "**common_chat**: The function of common_chat is to facilitate communication with a language model by sending a user-defined query along with system prompts and configuration settings.\n\n**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.\n· query: A string that represents the user input or question that will be sent to the language model.\n\n**Code Description**: The common_chat function is designed to interact with a language model (LLM) by calling the function `call_llm`. It takes a single parameter, `query`, which is expected to be a string. This string is typically the user's input that needs to be processed by the language model. The function constructs a call to `call_llm`, passing it several arguments: `model`, `sys_prompt`, `usr_prompt`, and `config`. Here, `model` refers to the specific language model being utilized, `sys_prompt` is a predefined system prompt that sets the context for the conversation, `usr_prompt` is the user query (in this case, the `query` parameter), and `config` contains additional configuration settings that may influence the behavior of the language model.\n\nThe common_chat function is called within the `chat_with_template` method of the BaseAgent class. In this context, `chat_with_template` prepares a prompt by rendering it with data provided in the `data` dictionary using a specified `prompt_template`. Once the prompt is rendered, it invokes `common_chat`, passing the rendered prompt as the query. The response from `common_chat` is then returned as the output of `chat_with_template`. This establishes a clear relationship where `chat_with_template` relies on `common_chat` to handle the actual communication with the language model after preparing the appropriate prompt.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `query` passed to common_chat is properly formatted and relevant to the context established by the system prompt to achieve meaningful responses from the language model.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the common_chat function could be a string such as \"Sure, I can help you with that!

It takes a single parameter, `query`, which is the input from the user. The method begins by invoking the `call_llm` function, passing the model, system prompt, user prompt (the query), and configuration settings. This function is responsible for communicating with the language model and retrieving a response based on the provided inputs.\n\nOnce the response from the language model is obtained, the method updates the conversation history by appending two entries: one for the user's query and another for the assistant's response. This history is stored in the `self.history` list, which allows for tracking the dialogue over time.\n\nThe common_chat function is called by the chat_with_template method, which serves as a preparatory step for generating a dynamic prompt based on input data. In chat_with_template, the prompt is rendered using a template and the relevant data, resulting in a `rendered_prompt`. This rendered prompt is then passed to common_chat as the query parameter. The response from common_chat is returned as the output of chat_with_template, establishing a clear functional relationship between the two methods.\n\nThis design allows for a structured conversation flow, where chat_with_template formats the input into a suitable prompt, and common_chat processes this prompt to obtain a response from the language model, while also maintaining a history of the interaction.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the query passed to common_chat is well-formed and relevant to the context of the conversation. This will enhance the quality of the response generated by the language model.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the common_chat function could be a string such as \"I'm here to help! What do you need assistance with?\" This response will depend on the specific query provided and the context established in the conversation history."

When invoked, it sets the instance variable `history` to an empty list. This effectively removes all previous entries stored in the `history`, allowing the agent to start fresh without any prior context or data. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where the agent needs to discard past interactions or data, ensuring that it operates without any influence from previous states. The simplicity of this function underscores its importance in maintaining the integrity of the agent's operational state.\n\n**Note**: It is important to use the clear_history function judiciously, as invoking it will permanently erase all historical data associated with the agent.

Upon initialization, the class sets up several attributes, including the original task, a list for sub-tasks, and configuration settings read from an external source. The class utilizes a templating engine to render prompts that guide the task breakdown process. \n\nThe `__init__` method initializes the Manager instance, setting up the necessary attributes and loading the configuration settings. The `receive_task` method allows the user to input an original task, which is stored in the `original_task` attribute. The `breakdown_task` method is responsible for taking the original task and rendering a prompt using the `breakdown_prompt` template. This rendered prompt is then passed to a function called `call_llm`, which presumably interacts with a language model to generate a response based on the task breakdown.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up and that the necessary template files are available in the specified prompt folder path. The `call_llm` function must also be properly defined elsewhere in the codebase to handle the interaction with the language model.\n\n**Output Example**: An example output from the `breakdown_task` method might look like this:\n```\n{\n    \"sub_tasks\": [\n        \"Research the topic\",\n        \"Draft an outline\",\n        \"Write the introduction\",\n        \"Gather references\"\n    ],\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"message\": \"Task has been successfully broken down.\"\n}\n```",

Upon initialization, the Manager class sets up its own attributes, including `original_task`, which is initialized as an empty string, and `sub_tasks`, which is initialized as an empty list. The `breakdown_prompt` is obtained from the environment's template system, specifically designed for breaking down tasks.\n\nThe primary method of interest in the Manager class is `receive_task`, which accepts a task as an argument and assigns it to the `original_task` attribute. This method is crucial for setting the context for subsequent operations. \n\nAnother significant method is `breakdown_task`, which is responsible for decomposing the original task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This method calls `get_data_for_breakdown` to prepare the necessary data, which includes the original task, and then utilizes the inherited `chat` method from the BaseAgent class. The `chat` method interacts with a language model to generate a response based on the breakdown prompt and the provided data.\n\nThe `get_data_for_breakdown` method constructs a dictionary containing the `original_task`, which is then used in the `chat` method to facilitate the breakdown process. This relationship illustrates how the Manager class leverages the capabilities of the BaseAgent class to perform its task management functions effectively.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the environment is properly set up with the necessary templates for the breakdown prompt. Additionally, the interaction with the language model through the `chat` method relies on the correct implementation of the `call_llm` function, which must be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible output from the `breakdown_task` method might look like this:\n```\n{\n    \"response\": \"To complete your task, consider the following steps: Define the scope, Research relevant information, Create an outline, Draft the content.\",\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"message\": \"Task breakdown completed successfully.\"\n}\n```",

The `breakdown_prompt` is loaded from a template file named 'manager_break_down.txt' using the environment object from the BaseAgent class, allowing for dynamic prompt generation based on the original task.\n\nThe primary method of the Manager class is `breakdown_task`, which is responsible for decomposing the original task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This method first retrieves the necessary data for breakdown by calling `get_data_for_breakdown`, which constructs a dictionary containing the `original_task`. The method then utilizes the `chat` method inherited from BaseAgent, passing the data and the `breakdown_prompt` to generate a response that outlines the sub-tasks.\n\nThe `get_data_for_breakdown` method serves as a utility function that prepares the data structure required for the breakdown process. It returns a dictionary with the key 'task' mapped to the `original_task`, ensuring that the prompt can be rendered with the correct context.\n\nIn summary, the Manager class leverages the capabilities of the BaseAgent class to facilitate task management, specifically focusing on breaking down complex tasks into simpler components that can be handled more effectively.\n\n**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the template file 'manager_break_down.txt' is correctly formatted and accessible within the specified prompt folder path. The interaction with the language model through the `chat` method relies on the proper implementation of the `call_llm` function, which must be defined in the BaseAgent class or elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible output from the `breakdown_task` method might look like this:\n```\n{\n    \"sub_tasks\": [\n        \"Define the main objectives of the task.\",\n        \"Identify the resources required.\",\n        \"Establish a timeline for completion.\"\n    ],\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"message\": \"Task has been successfully broken down.\"\n}\n```",

The class contains two primary methods: `breakdown_task` and `get_data_for_breakdown`.\n\nThe `breakdown_task` method is responsible for breaking down the original task into sub-tasks. It first calls the `get_data_for_breakdown` method to retrieve the necessary data, which includes the original task. This data is then passed to the `chat_with_template` method along with the breakdown prompt to generate the sub-tasks.\n\nThe `get_data_for_breakdown` method constructs and returns a dictionary containing the original task. This method serves as a helper function to provide the required data format for the breakdown process.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the original_task attribute is set before calling the breakdown_task method, as this will directly influence the output of the task breakdown process.\n\n**Output Example**: If the original_task is set to \"Prepare a project report\", the output of the breakdown_task method might resemble the following structure:\n- Sub-task 1: \"Gather data and statistics\"\n- Sub-task 2: \"Draft the report outline\"\n- Sub-task 3: \"Write the introduction section\"\n- Sub-task 4: \"Compile the final document\""

        "**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a new instance of the Manager class, setting up its attributes with default values and loading configuration settings.\n\n**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.\n· There are no parameters for this __init__ method.\n\n**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the Manager class, which is responsible for initializing the instance attributes when a new Manager object is created. Upon instantiation, the method performs the following actions:\n\n1. It initializes the `original_task` attribute as an empty string. This attribute is likely intended to hold the main task that the Manager will handle.\n2. The `sub_tasks` attribute is initialized as an empty list, which may be used to store any sub-tasks related to the original task.\n3. The `config` attribute is populated by calling the `read_config` function, which reads a configuration file and returns its contents as a dictionary. This function is defined in the agent_factory/config.py file and is crucial for loading the necessary settings for the Manager's operation.\n4. The `model` attribute is set by retrieving the value associated with the key 'default_model' from the `config` dictionary. If this key does not exist, it defaults to the string \"gpt-4o-mini\".\n5. The `env` attribute is initialized as an instance of the Environment class from the Jinja2 library, using a FileSystemLoader that points to the directory specified by the 'prompt_folder_path' key in the `config` dictionary. This setup allows the Manager to load templates for generating prompts.\n6. The `sys_prompt` attribute is initialized as an empty string, which may be used to store a system prompt for the Manager's operations.\n7. The `breakdown_prompt` attribute is assigned a template loaded from the file 'manager_break_down.txt' using the `env` object. This template is likely used for breaking down tasks or generating specific prompts.\n8. The `reflection_prompt` attribute is initialized as None, indicating that it may be set later in the process.\n9. Finally, the `repeat_turns` attribute is set to 10, which may define the number of iterations or turns the Manager will perform in certain operations.\n\nOverall, the __init__ method establishes the foundational state of the Manager object, ensuring that all necessary attributes are initialized and that configuration settings are loaded for subsequent use. The relationship with the `read_config` function is particularly important, as it provides the configuration data that influences the behavior of the Manager.\n\n**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the configuration file specified in the `read_config` function exists and is correctly formatted in YAML. Any issues with the configuration file may lead to errors during the initialization of the Manager instance.",
        "**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Manager class.\n\n**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.\n· There are no parameters for this function.\n\n**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method that is automatically called when an instance of the Manager class is created. It begins by invoking the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization defined in the parent class is also executed. \n\nFollowing this, the function initializes several instance variables:\n- `self.original_task` is set to an empty string, which is likely intended to hold the main task that the Manager will handle.\n- `self.sub_tasks` is initialized as an empty list, suggesting that this Manager instance can manage multiple sub-tasks related to the original task.\n- `self.breakdown_prompt` is assigned a template retrieved from the environment using `self.env.get_template('manager_break_down.txt')`. This indicates that the Manager class is likely designed to generate or manipulate prompts based on a predefined template, which could be used for task breakdowns.\n- `self.reflection_prompt` is initialized to `None`, indicating that it may be set later in the code, possibly to hold a prompt related to reflection or review of tasks.\n\nOverall, this constructor sets up the necessary attributes for the Manager class, preparing it for further operations related to task management.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parent class's constructor is called to maintain the integrity of the class hierarchy. Additionally, the template file 'manager_break_down.txt' should be present in the expected directory for the code to function correctly."

        "**breakdown_task**: The function of breakdown_task is to decompose a larger task into smaller sub-tasks.\n\n**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.\n· None\n\n**Code Description**: The breakdown_task method is a member of the Manager class and is responsible for breaking down an original task into sub-tasks. It begins by creating a dictionary named `data`, which contains the key 'task' associated with the value of `self.original_task`. This dictionary is then used to render a prompt through the `self.breakdown_prompt.render(**data)` method call. The rendered prompt is a structured input that will guide the language model in generating a relevant response.\n\nFollowing the prompt rendering, the method invokes the `call_llm` function, passing in several parameters: `self.model`, `self.sys_prompt`, and the `rendered_prompt`. The `call_llm` function is designed to interact with a language model API, specifically to generate a response based on the provided prompts. It initializes an OpenAI client using the model name and configuration settings, constructs a list of messages that includes both the system prompt and the user prompt, and then sends this data to the language model for processing.\n\nThe response from the `call_llm` function is captured in the variable `response_message`, which is then returned as the output of the breakdown_task method. This indicates that the breakdown_task method not only facilitates the decomposition of tasks but also serves as a bridge to the language model, allowing for intelligent processing and generation of sub-tasks based on the original task.\n\n**Note**: Ensure that the `self.original_task` and `self.breakdown_prompt` are properly initialized before calling this method to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, be aware of the API usage limits and the potential costs associated with calling the language model API.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the breakdown_task method could be a string such as \"The task can be broken down into the following sub-tasks: 1. Research the topic, 2. Draft an outline, 3. Write the introduction.\"",

This method first calls the get_data_for_breakdown method to retrieve the original task data, which is essential for the decomposition process. The data returned is structured as a dictionary, where the key 'task' holds the value of the original task that needs to be broken down.\n\nOnce the data is obtained, the breakdown_task method proceeds to invoke the chat method from the BaseAgent class. This method is designed to interact with a language model by generating a prompt based on the input data. In this case, the breakdown_task method passes the retrieved data and a predefined breakdown prompt to the chat method. The chat method then renders the prompt using the provided data and communicates with the language model to obtain a response, which is expected to contain the subtasks derived from the original task.\n\nThe relationship between breakdown_task and its callees is crucial for the overall functionality of task decomposition. The breakdown_task method relies on get_data_for_breakdown to ensure it has the correct context for the task at hand, and it utilizes the chat method to facilitate the interaction with the language model, effectively bridging the gap between the original task and its decomposition into subtasks.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the original task is properly initialized within the Manager class before invoking breakdown_task to avoid any runtime errors. Additionally, the breakdown prompt used in the chat method should be appropriately defined to elicit meaningful responses from the language model.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the breakdown_task method could be a list of subtasks such as [\"Research climate change effects\", \"Draft an outline for the report\", \"Write the introduction section\"].",

This function is designed to facilitate the loading of configuration settings that can be used throughout the application. The default file path points to a configuration file located in a 'config' directory, which is one level up from the current directory.\n\nIn the context of its usage, the read_config function is called within the __init__ method of the Manager class located in the agent_factory/manager.py file. During the initialization of a Manager object, the read_config function is invoked without any arguments, which means it will use the default file path to load the configuration settings. The resulting dictionary is stored in the `self.config` attribute of the Manager instance. This configuration dictionary is then used to retrieve various settings, such as the default model and the path to the prompt folder, which are essential for the operation of the Manager class.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the specified configuration file exists at the given path and is formatted correctly in YAML.

The default value is \"basic\".\n· topic: A literal value that specifies the topic of the search, which can be either \"general\" or \"news\". The default value is \"general\".\n· days: An integer indicating the number of days to look back for search results. The default value is 7.\n· max_results: An integer that sets the maximum number of results to return. The default value is 10.\n\n**Code Description**: The search function is designed to interact with an external API to retrieve search results based on the specified parameters. It constructs a data dictionary containing the search parameters, including the query, search depth, topic, days, maximum results, and the API key. The function then creates an HTTP client using the httpx library with a timeout of 30 seconds. It sends a POST request to the API endpoint for searching, appending the data as a JSON payload and including necessary headers.\n\nUpon receiving a response, the function checks the status code:\n- If the status code is 200, it means the request was successful, and the function returns the parsed JSON response as a SearchResponse object.\n- If the status code is 429, it indicates that the user has exceeded the allowed number of requests. In this case, the function attempts to extract a detailed error message from the response and raises a UsageLimitExceededError with that message.\n- If the status code is 401, it signifies an invalid API key, and the function raises an InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError.\n- For any other unsuccessful status codes, the function raises an HTTPStatusError.\n\nThe function ensures that the response is validated and structured as a SearchResponse model before returning it.\n\n**Note**: It is important to handle exceptions properly when using this function, especially for the cases of exceeding request limits or invalid API keys. Users should ensure that they have a valid API key and are aware of the rate limits imposed by the API.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:\n{\n    \"results\": [\n        {\n            \"title\": \"Example News Article\",\n            \"link\": \"https://example.com/news/article\",\n            \"published_date\": \"2023-10-01\",\n            \"snippet\": \"This is a brief summary of the news article.\"\n        },\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"total_results\": 5\n}"

Within this function, the super() function is called to invoke the constructor of the parent class, passing the string \"Tavily API key invalid.\" as an argument. This string serves as the error message that will be associated with the exception when it is raised. By calling the parent class's constructor, the InvalidTavilyAPIKeyError class inherits all the properties and methods of its parent class, ensuring that it behaves like a standard exception while also providing a specific error message that can be used for debugging or logging purposes.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that this exception is raised in appropriate contexts where an invalid Tavily API key is encountered, allowing for proper error handling in applications that utilize the Tavily API."

This list is initialized with an empty list by default.  \n· response_time: A float indicating the duration of the search operation, measured in seconds.\n\n**Code Description**: The SearchResponse class is a data model that inherits from BaseModel, designed to represent the outcome of a search operation. It includes three key attributes: `query`, `results`, and `response_time`. The `query` attribute holds the search term that was input by the user, providing context for the results returned. The `results` attribute is a list that contains instances of the SearchResult class, which encapsulate the details of each individual search result. This allows for a structured representation of multiple search outcomes, making it easier for developers to manage and display the data. The `response_time` attribute records the time taken to execute the search, which can be useful for performance monitoring and optimization.\n\nThe relationship between SearchResponse and SearchResult is integral, as SearchResponse acts as a container for multiple SearchResult instances. Each SearchResult provides detailed information about a specific search outcome, including attributes such as title, URL, content summary, relevance score, and an optional published date. This structure allows developers to effectively handle and present search results in their applications, ensuring that users receive comprehensive and relevant information based on their queries.\n\n**Note**: When utilizing the SearchResponse class, it is important to ensure that the `results` attribute is populated with valid SearchResult instances to maintain the integrity of the search response. Additionally, developers should consider the implications of the `response_time` attribute for user experience, as longer response times may affect the perceived performance of the search functionality."

It serves as a blueprint for creating specific search client implementations. The class contains a single abstract method, `search`, which must be implemented by any subclass that derives from BaseSearchClient. This method takes a string parameter `query`, which represents the search term or phrase, and accepts additional keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) that allow for flexible search configurations. The use of the `@abstractmethod` decorator indicates that subclasses are required to provide their own implementation of the `search` method, ensuring that any concrete search client adheres to this interface.\n\n**Note**: It is important to remember that since BaseSearchClient is an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated directly. Developers must create subclasses that implement the `search` method to utilize its functionality. This design pattern promotes code reusability and enforces a consistent interface across different search client implementations."

This suggests that the function is intended to be overridden or extended in subclasses or future implementations. The flexibility provided by the `**kwargs` parameter allows for the inclusion of various optional parameters that may influence the search process, such as filters, sorting options, or pagination settings. However, without a concrete implementation, the specific behavior and expected outcomes of the search function remain undefined.\n\n**Note**: It is important to implement the search logic in subclasses or to ensure that this function is properly defined before invoking it.
