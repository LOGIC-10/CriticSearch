        "**CriticAgent**: The function of CriticAgent is to generate critiques based on user questions and agent responses.\n\n**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.\n· original_task: A string that holds the user's original question or task.\n· critic_prompt: A template used for generating critiques, retrieved from the environment.\n· agent_answer: A string that stores the answer provided by the agent.\n\n**Code Description**: The CriticAgent class inherits from the BaseAgent class and is designed to facilitate the generation of critiques for agent responses to user questions. Upon initialization, it sets up the original task as an empty string and retrieves a template for critiques from the environment, specifically from a file named 'critic_agent.txt'. \n\nThe class contains several methods:\n- The `__init__` method initializes the instance of the CriticAgent, setting up the original task and loading the critique template.\n- The `critic` method is responsible for generating a critique. It first gathers the necessary data by calling the `get_data_for_critic` method, which collects the user's question and the agent's answer. It then utilizes the `chat_with_template` method to interact with the critique template and obtain a response from the model. The response is expected to be in YAML format, which is validated and formatted. If the response contains invalid YAML, an error message is printed, and the method returns None.\n- The `receive_agent_answer` method allows the CriticAgent to store the agent's answer for later critique.\n- The `get_data_for_critic` method constructs and returns a dictionary containing the original user question and the agent's answer, which is essential for generating the critique.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the agent's answer is properly received before invoking the `critic` method, as the critique generation relies on this data. Additionally, users should handle potential YAML errors gracefully when utilizing the `critic` method.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `critic` method could be a formatted YAML string such as:\n```yaml\ncritique:\n  - feedback: \"The response was clear and concise.\"\n  - suggestions:\n      - \"Consider providing more examples.\"\n      - \"Ensure to address all parts of the user's question.\"\n```"

It first invokes the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, it initializes an instance variable `original_task` to an empty string, which is likely intended to hold a description or identifier of the task that the agent will be working on. Additionally, it initializes another instance variable `critic_prompt` by calling `self.env.get_template('critic_agent.txt')`. This line suggests that the CriticAgent class is associated with an environment that can retrieve templates, and it specifically loads a template named 'critic_agent.txt'. This template may be used later in the class for generating prompts or responses related to the critic agent's functionality.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the environment (`self.env`) is properly set up before this constructor is called, as it relies on the `get_template` method to function correctly. Additionally, the `original_task` variable should be assigned a meaningful value before it is used in any operations to avoid issues with uninitialized data."

It begins by invoking the get_data_for_critic method, which retrieves essential data in the form of a dictionary containing the user's question and the agent's answer. This data is then passed to the chat_with_template method along with a predefined prompt (self.critic_prompt) to generate a model response.\n\nThe expected output from chat_with_template is a string formatted in YAML. The critic method subsequently attempts to validate and format this YAML content using the extract_and_validate_yaml method. If the YAML content is valid, it is returned as the output of the critic method. However, if a YAMLError occurs during this validation process, an error message is printed to the console, and the method returns None.\n\nThe relationship between critic and its callees is crucial for its functionality. The get_data_for_critic method provides the necessary context for the critique by supplying the user question and agent answer. The chat_with_template method is responsible for generating the critique based on this context, while extract_and_validate_yaml ensures that the output is in a valid format. This structured flow ensures that the critique process is both systematic and reliable.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the instance variables self.original_task and self.agent_answer are properly initialized before calling this function to avoid returning None or causing errors in the subsequent processing.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the critic method could be a well-structured YAML string, such as:\n```yaml\nreview:\n  user_question: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n  agent_answer: \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n  critique: \"The answer is accurate and concise.\"\n```"

The value for 'user_question' is obtained from the instance variable self.original_task, which presumably holds the question posed by the user. The value for 'agent_answer' is derived from another instance variable, self.agent_answer, which likely contains the response generated by the agent to the user's question.\n\nThis function is called within the critic method of the same class. The critic method is responsible for generating a review or critique based on the interaction between the user and the agent. It first calls get_data_for_critic to gather the necessary data, which is then used to create a model response through the chat_with_template method. The output from chat_with_template is expected to be in a YAML format, which is subsequently validated and formatted. If the YAML content is invalid, an error is caught, and a message is printed.\n\nThus, get_data_for_critic plays a crucial role in providing the foundational data needed for the critique process, ensuring that the user question and agent's answer are readily accessible for further processing.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the instance variables self.original_task and self.agent_answer are properly initialized before calling this function to avoid returning None or causing errors in the subsequent processing.\n\n**Output Example**: An example of the return value from get_data_for_critic could look like this:\n{\n    'user_question': 'What is the capital of France?',\n    'agent_answer': 'The capital of France is Paris.'\n}"

It begins by initializing an OpenAI client using the provided model name and configuration settings. The configuration includes essential parameters such as the API key, base URL, timeout, and maximum retries, which are retrieved from the config dictionary.\n\nNext, the function constructs a list of messages that includes both the system prompt and the user prompt. This structured format is necessary for the chat completion request to the API. The function then calls the chat completion method of the OpenAI client, passing in the model name, the constructed messages, and additional parameters like temperature and maximum tokens.\n\nUpon receiving the response from the API, the function extracts the content of the first message choice from the response object and returns it. This content represents the model's generated reply based on the provided prompts.\n\nThe call_llm function is invoked within the breakdown_task method of the Manager class in the agent_factory/manager.py file. In this context, it is used to break down a larger task into smaller sub-tasks by rendering a prompt and sending it to the language model for processing. The response from call_llm is then returned as the output of the breakdown_task method, indicating its role in task decomposition and interaction with the language model.\n\n**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the configuration dictionary is properly populated with all necessary keys and values to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, be mindful of the API usage limits and the potential costs associated with calling the OpenAI API.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the call_llm function could be a string such as \"To break down the task, consider the following steps: 1.

It does so by creating a client instance for the OpenAI service using the configuration values passed in the `config` parameter. The function then constructs a list of messages that includes the system message (`sys_prompt`) and the user message (`usr_prompt`). This list is sent as part of the request to the `chat.completions.create` method of the API client.\n\nThe function retrieves the response from the API and extracts the model's reply from the `choices` list in the response. Specifically, it fetches the content of the message from the first choice in the list, which is assumed to be the relevant response from the model.\n\nKey steps in the process:\n1. An instance of the OpenAI client is created using the provided configuration values, including the API key, base URL, timeout, and retry settings.\n2. A list of messages is constructed, where the system message provides context or instructions, and the user message contains the query or input.\n3. The request is sent to the API, specifying the model, the messages, and other parameters like temperature.\n4. The model's response is extracted from the API's response and returned as the result.\n\nThe `call_llm` function is called within the `chat` method of the `BaseAgent` class in the `agent_factory/agent.py` module. In this context, it is used to send a dynamically rendered prompt to the language model based on the input data. The system and user prompts are provided as part of this interaction, and the function returns the model's response to be processed further or sent back to the user.\n\n**Note**:  \n- The `config` parameter must include valid API keys and any necessary configuration settings like `timeout`, `max_retries`, and `temperature` for the API request to be successful.\n- The function assumes the model will return a response in the form of a list of choices, with the actual message located in `response.choices[0].message`.\n- While the `max_tokens` parameter is mentioned in the code as a potential setting, it is commented out, implying it is either optional or controlled elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n**Output Example**:  \nThe return value of `call_llm` would typically be a string representing the content of the model's response. For example:\n\n```\n\"Sure, here's the information you requested: ... \"\n```",

It begins by initializing an OpenAI client using the provided configuration settings. The API key and base URL are extracted from the config dictionary based on the specified model, ensuring that the correct credentials and endpoint are used for the API call.\n\nThe function constructs a list of messages that includes both the system prompt and the user prompt. These messages are formatted as dictionaries, where each dictionary specifies the role (either \"system\" or \"user\") and the corresponding content. This structured format is essential for the language model to understand the context of the conversation.\n\nNext, the function calls the chat completion method of the OpenAI client, passing in the model identifier, the constructed messages, and additional parameters such as temperature. The temperature setting influences the randomness of the model's responses, allowing for more creative or focused outputs depending on the desired outcome.\n\nUpon receiving the response from the API, the function extracts the content of the first message choice returned by the model. This content represents the model's reply to the user prompt and is returned as the output of the call_llm function.\n\nThe call_llm function is invoked by the chat method of the BaseAgent class, which is responsible for generating user-specific prompts based on input data. The chat method renders a prompt template using the provided data and then calls call_llm with the necessary parameters. This relationship highlights the role of call_llm as a backend service that processes user interactions and generates responses from the language model.\n\n**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the configuration settings provided to the call_llm function are complete and valid to avoid errors during the API interaction. Additionally, the model specified must be supported by the OpenAI client to ensure successful communication.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the call_llm function could be a string such as \"Here is the information you requested based on your input: ...\"",

The class sets up an environment for loading these templates, allowing for dynamic prompt generation based on the data provided during chat interactions.\n\nThe `chat` method is a core function of the BaseAgent class, which facilitates communication with the language model. It takes in a data dictionary and a prompt template, rendering the prompt with the provided data. The rendered prompt is then sent to a function called `call_llm`, which is responsible for interacting with the language model and generating a response based on the system prompt and user prompt.\n\nThe BaseAgent class is utilized by the Manager class, which inherits from it. The Manager class leverages the chat functionality of BaseAgent to break down tasks into sub-tasks. It initializes its own attributes while also inheriting the configuration and model settings from BaseAgent. This relationship allows the Manager to effectively utilize the chat method to interact with the language model for task management purposes.\n\n**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up and that the necessary template files are available in the specified prompt folder path. The `call_llm` function must also be properly defined elsewhere in the codebase to handle the interaction with the language model.\n\n**Output Example**: An example output from the `chat` method might look like this:\n```\n{\n    \"response\": \"Here are the steps to break down your task: Research the topic, Draft an outline, Write the introduction, Gather references.\",\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"message\": \"Response generated successfully.\"\n}\n```",

Upon initialization, it reads configuration settings, including the default model and the path for prompt templates. The class utilizes the Jinja2 templating engine to load prompts from the specified folder, allowing for dynamic prompt generation based on the provided data.\n\nThe primary method of interest in the BaseAgent class is `chat`, which takes in a data dictionary and a prompt template. This method renders the prompt using the provided data, enabling the customization of the prompt based on the specific context of the conversation. It then calls the `call_llm` function, passing the rendered prompt along with the system prompt and model configuration to obtain a response from the language model. This interaction is crucial for generating contextually relevant replies in a chat setting.\n\nAnother significant method is `receive_task`, which allows the agent to accept and store an original task. This method is essential for setting the context for subsequent operations, particularly in scenarios where the agent is expected to perform tasks based on the received input.\n\nThe BaseAgent class is inherited by the Manager class, which extends its functionalities to include task management capabilities. The Manager class utilizes the `receive_task` method to store the original task and employs the `chat` method to break down the task into sub-tasks. This relationship illustrates how the Manager class leverages the capabilities of the BaseAgent class to perform its task management functions effectively.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up with the necessary parameters, including the model and prompt folder path. Additionally, the interaction with the language model through the `chat` method relies on the correct implementation of the `call_llm` function, which must be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible output from the `chat` method might look like this:\n```\n{\n    \"response\": \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\",\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"message\": \"Chat initiated successfully.\"\n}\n```",

Upon initialization, it reads the configuration settings, including the default model and the path for prompt templates. The class provides several methods to interact with the model and process tasks.\n\nThe `common_chat` method takes a user query as input and calls the language model using the specified system prompt and user prompt. This method serves as the primary interface for generating responses based on user input.\n\nThe `chat_with_template` method allows for dynamic prompt generation by rendering a template with provided data. It utilizes the Jinja2 templating engine to create a customized prompt before passing it to the `common_chat` method for processing.\n\nThe `receive_task` method is used to accept and store an original task, which can be further processed or utilized in chat interactions.\n\nThe `extract_and_validate_yaml` method is responsible for extracting YAML content from a model's response. It uses regular expressions to find content wrapped in ```yaml``` tags and attempts to parse it using the PyYAML library. If successful, it returns the YAML content in a standardized format; otherwise, it handles errors gracefully by returning None.\n\n**Note**: When using the BaseAgent class, ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up with the necessary parameters, including the prompt folder path and the default model. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented when dealing with YAML content to avoid runtime exceptions.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `common_chat` method could be a string response from the language model, such as: \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\" If the `extract_and_validate_yaml` method is called with a valid model response containing YAML, it might return a formatted YAML string like:\n```yaml\nkey1: value1\nkey2: value2\n```"

It is called when an instance of the class is created. The method performs several key operations:\n\n1. It invokes the read_config function to load configuration settings from a YAML file. This function returns a dictionary containing various configuration parameters, which is stored in the instance variable self.config.\n\n2. The method retrieves the value associated with the key 'default_model' from the configuration dictionary. If this key is not present, it defaults to the string \"gpt-4o-mini\". This value is stored in the instance variable self.model, which likely represents the model that the agent will use for its operations.\n\n3. The method initializes an Environment object from the Jinja2 templating library. This object is configured with a loader that points to the directory specified by the 'prompt_folder_path' key in the configuration dictionary. This allows the agent to dynamically load prompt templates from the specified folder.\n\n4. The instance variable self.sys_prompt is initialized as an empty string, which may be used later to store system prompts or messages.\n\n5. Finally, the method sets self.repeat_turns to 10, which could indicate the number of times the agent is allowed to repeat certain actions or interactions during its operation.\n\nOverall, the __init__ method establishes the foundational settings and components necessary for the BaseAgent to function effectively. It relies on the read_config function to ensure that the agent is configured according to the specified settings in the YAML file, thus enabling flexibility and customization in its behavior.\n\n**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the YAML configuration file is accessible and correctly formatted. Any issues with file access or parsing may result in runtime errors, preventing the BaseAgent from initializing properly."

It takes a single parameter, `query`, which is expected to be a string. This string is typically the user's input that needs to be processed by the language model. The function constructs a call to `call_llm`, passing it several arguments: `model`, `sys_prompt`, `usr_prompt`, and `config`. Here, `model` refers to the specific language model being utilized, `sys_prompt` is a predefined system prompt that sets the context for the conversation, `usr_prompt` is the user query (in this case, the `query` parameter), and `config` contains additional configuration settings that may influence the behavior of the language model.\n\nThe common_chat function is called within the `chat_with_template` method of the BaseAgent class. In this context, `chat_with_template` prepares a prompt by rendering it with data provided in the `data` dictionary using a specified `prompt_template`. Once the prompt is rendered, it invokes `common_chat`, passing the rendered prompt as the query. The response from `common_chat` is then returned as the output of `chat_with_template`.

Upon initialization, the class sets up several attributes, including the original task, a list for sub-tasks, and configuration settings read from an external source. The class utilizes a templating engine to render prompts that guide the task breakdown process. \n\nThe `__init__` method initializes the Manager instance, setting up the necessary attributes and loading the configuration settings. The `receive_task` method allows the user to input an original task, which is stored in the `original_task` attribute. The `breakdown_task` method is responsible for taking the original task and rendering a prompt using the `breakdown_prompt` template. This rendered prompt is then passed to a function called `call_llm`, which presumably interacts with a language model to generate a response based on the task breakdown.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the configuration file is correctly set up and that the necessary template files are available in the specified prompt folder path. The `call_llm` function must also be properly defined elsewhere in the codebase to handle the interaction with the language model.\n\n**Output Example**: An example output from the `breakdown_task` method might look like this:\n```\n{\n    \"sub_tasks\": [\n        \"Research the topic\",\n        \"Draft an outline\",\n        \"Write the introduction\",\n        \"Gather references\"\n    ],\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"message\": \"Task has been successfully broken down.\"\n}\n```",
        "**Manager**: The function of Manager is to handle task management by receiving original tasks and breaking them down into sub-tasks.\n\n**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.\n· original_task: A string that stores the original task received by the Manager.  \n· sub_tasks: A list that holds the sub-tasks generated from the breakdown of the original task.  \n· breakdown_prompt: A template used for generating prompts related to breaking down tasks, retrieved from the environment.  \n· reflection_prompt: A variable that is initialized as None, intended for future use related to task reflection.\n\n**Code Description**: The Manager class extends the BaseAgent class, inheriting its functionalities and attributes while adding specific capabilities for task management. Upon initialization, the Manager class sets up its own attributes, including `original_task`, which is initialized as an empty string, and `sub_tasks`, which is initialized as an empty list. The `breakdown_prompt` is obtained from the environment's template system, specifically designed for breaking down tasks.\n\nThe primary method of interest in the Manager class is `receive_task`, which accepts a task as an argument and assigns it to the `original_task` attribute. This method is crucial for setting the context for subsequent operations. \n\nAnother significant method is `breakdown_task`, which is responsible for decomposing the original task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This method calls `get_data_for_breakdown` to prepare the necessary data, which includes the original task, and then utilizes the inherited `chat` method from the BaseAgent class. The `chat` method interacts with a language model to generate a response based on the breakdown prompt and the provided data.\n\nThe `get_data_for_breakdown` method constructs a dictionary containing the `original_task`, which is then used in the `chat` method to facilitate the breakdown process. This relationship illustrates how the Manager class leverages the capabilities of the BaseAgent class to perform its task management functions effectively.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the environment is properly set up with the necessary templates for the breakdown prompt. Additionally, the interaction with the language model through the `chat` method relies on the correct implementation of the `call_llm` function, which must be defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible output from the `breakdown_task` method might look like this:\n```\n{\n    \"response\": \"To complete your task, consider the following steps: Define the scope, Research relevant information, Create an outline, Draft the content.\",\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"message\": \"Task breakdown completed successfully.\"\n}\n```",

Upon initialization, the Manager class calls the constructor of the BaseAgent, ensuring that all foundational attributes and methods are available. It initializes its own attributes, including `original_task`, which is set to an empty string, and `sub_tasks`, which is initialized as an empty list. The `breakdown_prompt` is loaded from a template file named 'manager_break_down.txt' using the environment object from the BaseAgent class, allowing for dynamic prompt generation based on the original task.\n\nThe primary method of the Manager class is `breakdown_task`, which is responsible for decomposing the original task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This method first retrieves the necessary data for breakdown by calling `get_data_for_breakdown`, which constructs a dictionary containing the `original_task`. The method then utilizes the `chat` method inherited from BaseAgent, passing the data and the `breakdown_prompt` to generate a response that outlines the sub-tasks.\n\nThe `get_data_for_breakdown` method serves as a utility function that prepares the data structure required for the breakdown process. It returns a dictionary with the key 'task' mapped to the `original_task`, ensuring that the prompt can be rendered with the correct context.\n\nIn summary, the Manager class leverages the capabilities of the BaseAgent class to facilitate task management, specifically focusing on breaking down complex tasks into simpler components that can be handled more effectively.\n\n**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the template file 'manager_break_down.txt' is correctly formatted and accessible within the specified prompt folder path. The interaction with the language model through the `chat` method relies on the proper implementation of the `call_llm` function, which must be defined in the BaseAgent class or elsewhere in the codebase.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible output from the `breakdown_task` method might look like this:\n```\n{\n    \"sub_tasks\": [\n        \"Define the main objectives of the task.\",\n        \"Identify the resources required.\",\n        \"Establish a timeline for completion.\"\n    ],\n    \"status\": \"success\",\n    \"message\": \"Task has been successfully broken down.\"\n}\n```",

Upon initialization, the class sets up the original task as an empty string and initializes an empty list for sub-tasks. It also retrieves a template for task breakdown prompts from the environment, which will be used in the breakdown process. The class contains two primary methods: `breakdown_task` and `get_data_for_breakdown`.\n\nThe `breakdown_task` method is responsible for breaking down the original task into sub-tasks. It first calls the `get_data_for_breakdown` method to retrieve the necessary data, which includes the original task. This data is then passed to the `chat_with_template` method along with the breakdown prompt to generate the sub-tasks.\n\nThe `get_data_for_breakdown` method constructs and returns a dictionary containing the original task. This method serves as a helper function to provide the required data format for the breakdown process.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the original_task attribute is set before calling the breakdown_task method, as this will directly influence the output of the task breakdown process.\n\n**Output Example**: If the original_task is set to \"Prepare a project report\", the output of the breakdown_task method might resemble the following structure:\n- Sub-task 1: \"Gather data and statistics\"\n- Sub-task 2: \"Draft the report outline\"\n- Sub-task 3: \"Write the introduction section\"\n- Sub-task 4: \"Compile the final document\""

Upon instantiation, the method performs the following actions:\n\n1. It initializes the `original_task` attribute as an empty string. This attribute is likely intended to hold the main task that the Manager will handle.\n2. The `sub_tasks` attribute is initialized as an empty list, which may be used to store any sub-tasks related to the original task.\n3. The `config` attribute is populated by calling the `read_config` function, which reads a configuration file and returns its contents as a dictionary. This function is defined in the agent_factory/config.py file and is crucial for loading the necessary settings for the Manager's operation.\n4. The `model` attribute is set by retrieving the value associated with the key 'default_model' from the `config` dictionary. If this key does not exist, it defaults to the string \"gpt-4o-mini\".\n5.

It begins by creating a dictionary named `data`, which contains the key 'task' associated with the value of `self.original_task`. This dictionary is then used to render a prompt through the `self.breakdown_prompt.render(**data)` method call. The rendered prompt is a structured input that will guide the language model in generating a relevant response.\n\nFollowing the prompt rendering, the method invokes the `call_llm` function, passing in several parameters: `self.model`, `self.sys_prompt`, and the `rendered_prompt`. The `call_llm` function is designed to interact with a language model API, specifically to generate a response based on the provided prompts. It initializes an OpenAI client using the model name and configuration settings, constructs a list of messages that includes both the system prompt and the user prompt, and then sends this data to the language model for processing.\n\nThe response from the `call_llm` function is captured in the variable `response_message`, which is then returned as the output of the breakdown_task method. This indicates that the breakdown_task method not only facilitates the decomposition of tasks but also serves as a bridge to the language model, allowing for intelligent processing and generation of sub-tasks based on the original task.\n\n**Note**: Ensure that the `self.original_task` and `self.breakdown_prompt` are properly initialized before calling this method to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, be aware of the API usage limits and the potential costs associated with calling the language model API.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the breakdown_task method could be a string such as \"The task can be broken down into the following sub-tasks: 1. Research the topic, 2. Draft an outline, 3. Write the introduction.\"",

This method first calls the get_data_for_breakdown method to retrieve the original task data, which is essential for the decomposition process. The data returned is structured as a dictionary, where the key 'task' holds the value of the original task that needs to be broken down.\n\nOnce the data is obtained, the breakdown_task method proceeds to invoke the chat method from the BaseAgent class. This method is designed to interact with a language model by generating a prompt based on the input data. In this case, the breakdown_task method passes the retrieved data and a predefined breakdown prompt to the chat method. The chat method then renders the prompt using the provided data and communicates with the language model to obtain a response, which is expected to contain the subtasks derived from the original task.\n\nThe relationship between breakdown_task and its callees is crucial for the overall functionality of task decomposition. The breakdown_task method relies on get_data_for_breakdown to ensure it has the correct context for the task at hand, and it utilizes the chat method to facilitate the interaction with the language model, effectively bridging the gap between the original task and its decomposition into subtasks.\n\n**Note**: It is important to ensure that the original task is properly initialized within the Manager class before invoking breakdown_task to avoid any runtime errors. Additionally, the breakdown prompt used in the chat method should be appropriately defined to elicit meaningful responses from the language model.\n\n**Output Example**: A possible return value from the breakdown_task method could be a list of subtasks such as [\"Research climate change effects\", \"Draft an outline for the report\", \"Write the introduction section\"].",
