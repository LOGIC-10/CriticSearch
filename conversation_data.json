Partial results released on Friday showed the Umbrella for Democratic Change, an opposition coalition led by Harvard-trained human rights lawyer Duma Boko, securing 26 seats in Botswana’s 61-seat legislature and on course to win a majority. “It is an opportunity for the government of Botswana, in our view, to acquire a substantial controlling stake in De Beers,” Boko said in the interview.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[8]:\nTITLE: Botswana: Inside the Country's Most Competitive Election to Date\nURL: https://africaelects.com/2024/10/28/botswana-inside-the-countrys-most-competitive-election-to-date/\nCONTENT: On 30 October, Botswana will hold its thirteenth parliamentary elections, marking the most formidable challenge that the ruling  Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has faced since coming to power.

Since gaining independence in 1966, Botswana has maintained a consistent record of holding regular democratic elections, though the political sphere has been dominated by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) for nearly six decades. Botswana uses the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) majority system for both National Assembly and Local Government elections. The 2024 Botswana election results reveal several significant insights about the country's political landscape. The 2024 election not only marks a significant milestone in the country's democratic journey but also opens up important discussions about the nature of representation and the potential for electoral reform.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[2]:\nTITLE: Botswana profile - Timeline - BBC News\nURL: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13041658\nCONTENT: 2009 April - Botswana says it will halve diamond production because of falling demands for gems. 2009 October - Ruling BDP party wins elections, and another 5-year term for President Khama.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[3]:\nTITLE: What You Need to Know About Botswana's General Elections\nURL: https://www.okayafrica.com/botswana-general-elections/\nCONTENT: What You Need to Know About Botswana’s General Elections | OkayAfrica LatestNorth AfricaEast AfricaSouthern AfricaWest AfricaCentral AfricaWhat It's Like To...Sports LatestNorth AfricaEast AfricaSouthern AfricaWest AfricaCentral AfricaWhat It's Like To...Sports As Botswana heads to the polls on October 30, President Mokgweetsi Masisi faces a challenging re-election bid against a backdrop of public discontent.

Below are key issues in relation to the political context, legal framework, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), voter registration, political parties, party and campaign finances, role of media, and civil society that African citizens should know as they anticipate paying close attention to Botswana’s 2024 elections, which are expected to take place in October this year.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[6]:\nTITLE: Botswana's Political Shake-Up: What the Ruling Party's Historic Loss ...\nURL: https://www.princetonpoliticalreview.org/international-news/botswanas-political-shake-up-what-the-ruling-partys-historic-loss-means-for-democracy-in-sadc\nCONTENT: Unlike similar countries in the SADC like South Africa, Mozambique, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Botswana did not have to go through a bloody war to gain its independence. In a stark contrast to Botswana’s peaceful journey to independence, countries like South Africa, Mozambique, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) endured protracted and violent struggles against colonial and oppressive regimes. The political systems currently in place in Botswana stand in stark contrast to those of other SADC countries that experienced violent struggles for independence, such as Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The peaceful transition of power in Botswana, a country long viewed as a stable democracy, may offer a blueprint for change in neighboring nations that have been struggling with authoritarian regimes and human rights violations.\n--------------------------------------------------"

Since gaining independence in 1966, Botswana has maintained a consistent record of holding regular democratic elections, though the political sphere has been dominated by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) for nearly six decades. Botswana uses the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) majority system for both National Assembly and Local Government elections. The 2024 Botswana election results reveal several significant insights about the country's political landscape. The 2024 election not only marks a significant milestone in the country's democratic journey but also opens up important discussions about the nature of representation and the potential for electoral reform.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[4]:\nTITLE: Botswana's ruling party loses power as election results show\nURL: https://iharare.com/botswanas-ruling-party-loses-power-after-nearly-60-years-early-election-results-show/\nCONTENT: Botswana's ruling party loses power as election results show Botswana’s Ruling Party Loses Power After Nearly 60 Years, Early Election Results Show After almost six decades of dominance, Botswana’s ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has faced an unexpected defeat, according to preliminary election results. Early election tallies indicate that the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), under the leadership of President Mokgweetsi Masisi, has lost its long-standing hold on power. According to the newspaper Mmegi, which provided updates on social media, “As of 05:04 AM, November 1, 2024, opposition parties have garnered more than half of the parliamentary seats.” This shift marks the official loss of power for the BDP, ending its long-standing governance of Botswana.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[5]:\nTITLE: Botswana Elections 2024: Just But Unfair - Botswana Gazette\nURL: https://www.thegazette.news/features/botswana-elections-2024-just-but-unfair/\nCONTENT: Under proportional representation (PR), Botswana could achieve a more accurate reflection of voter support in its National Assembly, enhancing democratic legitimacy and fairness. In contrast, the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) received 31% of the popular vote yet won only 4 seats, demonstrating how FPTP magnifies majorities in certain constituencies but fails to represent actual voter support across the nation. Our FPTP system has created a significant imbalance between the percentage of votes received by each party and their representation in the National Assembly.

Major shifts—ranging from growing economic discontent, the return of former president Khama and the BDP’s internal divisions—have turned this into an election that is up in the air. Decades-long dominance shook when Ian Khama, Seretse’s son and former president, threw his support behind the newly formed Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and the opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), leading to significant swings in favour of the opposition. Former president Ian Khama’s recent return to Botswana, after three years of self-imposed exile in South Africa, has injected fresh energy and tension into the political landscape ahead of the election.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[3]:\nTITLE: Botswana's stunning election upset puts elites on notice\nURL: https://responsiblestatecraft.org/botswana-election/\nCONTENT: In a stunning result that ran counter to much of the pre-election analysis and expectations, the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which had ruled Botswana since the country’s first post-independence election in 1966, lost its parliamentary majority in last Wednesday’s elections by a landslide. In the latest election, the UDC ran in direct opposition to the BDP, arguing that the long-ruling party had repeatedly failed to deliver for the 2.5 million people of Botswana on issues ranging from the economy to healthcare, made worse by allegations of corruption.

The presidential election that led to Duma Boko’s victory had a profound impact on Botswana’s political landscape. This peaceful change demonstrated Botswana’s democratic maturity and strengthened the credibility of the country’s political institutions. This exemplary political transition in Botswana contrasts with the post-election crises that often shake other countries on the African continent.

In contrast, the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) received 31% of the popular vote yet won only 4 seats, demonstrating how FPTP magnifies majorities in certain constituencies but fails to represent actual voter support across the nation. Our FPTP system has created a significant imbalance between the percentage of votes received by each party and their representation in the National Assembly. With PR, each vote carries equal weight, making the National Assembly a true reflection of Botswana’s diverse political landscape and a fairer platform for representation.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[2]:\nTITLE: Botswana: Parliamentary elections 2024 - mewc.org\nURL: https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024\nCONTENT: Few women stand for elections in the parliamentary elections in Botswana.

Major shifts—ranging from growing economic discontent, the return of former president Khama and the BDP’s internal divisions—have turned this into an election that is up in the air. Decades-long dominance shook when Ian Khama, Seretse’s son and former president, threw his support behind the newly formed Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and the opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), leading to significant swings in favour of the opposition. Former president Ian Khama’s recent return to Botswana, after three years of self-imposed exile in South Africa, has injected fresh energy and tension into the political landscape ahead of the election.\n--------------------------------------------------"

Botswana uses the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) majority system for both National Assembly and Local Government elections. The 2024 Botswana election results reveal several significant insights about the country's political landscape. The 2024 election not only marks a significant milestone in the country's democratic journey but also opens up important discussions about the nature of representation and the potential for electoral reform.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[2]:\nTITLE: Floor-Crossing Ban Reshapes Political Accountability - Botswana\nURL: https://www.africa-press.net/botswana/all-news/floor-crossing-ban-reshapes-political-accountability\nCONTENT: Africa-Press - Botswana.

President Mokgweetsi Masisi’s Botswana Democratic Party paid the price of a downturn triggered by a collapse in the diamond market, which generates the bulk of government revenue and export earnings, and has left the country with a 28% unemployment rate. Partial results released on Friday showed the Umbrella for Democratic Change, an opposition coalition led by Harvard-trained human rights lawyer Duma Boko, securing 26 seats in Botswana’s 61-seat legislature and on course to win a majority. “It is an opportunity for the government of Botswana, in our view, to acquire a substantial controlling stake in De Beers,” Boko said in the interview.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[7]:\nTITLE: Botswana's Political Shake-Up: What the Ruling Party's Historic Loss ...\nURL: https://www.princetonpoliticalreview.org/international-news/botswanas-political-shake-up-what-the-ruling-partys-historic-loss-means-for-democracy-in-sadc\nCONTENT: Unlike similar countries in the SADC like South Africa, Mozambique, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Botswana did not have to go through a bloody war to gain its independence. In a stark contrast to Botswana’s peaceful journey to independence, countries like South Africa, Mozambique, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) endured protracted and violent struggles against colonial and oppressive regimes. The political systems currently in place in Botswana stand in stark contrast to those of other SADC countries that experienced violent struggles for independence, such as Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The peaceful transition of power in Botswana, a country long viewed as a stable democracy, may offer a blueprint for change in neighboring nations that have been struggling with authoritarian regimes and human rights violations.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[8]:\nTITLE: Botswana's election shock: analyst reflects on why voters kicked the ...\nURL: https://theconversation.com/botswanas-election-shock-analyst-reflects-on-why-voters-kicked-the-ruling-party-out-after-58-years-242811\nCONTENT: Arts + Culture Economy Education Environment + Energy Ethics + Religion Health Politics + Society Science + Tech World Podcasts The dramatic loss of power by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which had governed Botswana since independence in 1966, will go down in history as one of the biggest electoral upsets in Africa.

Botswana operates as a multiparty democracy where multiple political parties vie for control of the government. Parties also have strong social foundations, but clientelism is notably prevalent within the governing Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) due to its control over state resources. Despite this, the Bank of Botswana remains independent and is capable of effectively communicating with other stakeholders in the financial sector while also providing advisory support to the government.\n--------------------------------------------------"

Since gaining independence in 1966, Botswana has maintained a consistent record of holding regular democratic elections, though the political sphere has been dominated by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) for nearly six decades. Botswana uses the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) majority system for both National Assembly and Local Government elections. The 2024 Botswana election results reveal several significant insights about the country's political landscape. The 2024 election not only marks a significant milestone in the country's democratic journey but also opens up important discussions about the nature of representation and the potential for electoral reform.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[2]:\nTITLE: Botswana president concedes election, ending governing party's six ...\nURL: https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20241101-botswana-governing-party-losing-six-decade-rule-early-tallies-show\nCONTENT: Electoral officials organise the ballot papers for verification at a counting centre in Gaborone-Bonington North constituency on October 31, 2024. ... 2024, during Botswana's general election\n--------------------------------------------------\n[3]:\nTITLE: IEC Botswana Provides Comprehensive Update on 2024 General Elections ...\nURL: https://www.botswanayouth.com/iec-botswana-provides-comprehensive-update-on-2024-general-elections-preparations/\nCONTENT: IEC Botswana Provides Comprehensive Update on 2024 General Elections Preparations As Botswana approaches its 2024 General Elections, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has provided a detailed briefing on the preparations, highlighting progress across several key areas critical to the smooth conduct of the elections. The briefing included an update on the process and timeline for the dissolution of Parliament, which is a crucial step preceding the General Elections. In preparation for the elections, the IEC has commenced the recruitment and training of poll staff. This includes a comprehensive program to ensure that all electoral officers are well-prepared to manage polling stations and handle election materials effectively. The IEC remains focused on ensuring that the 2024 General Elections are conducted in a free, fair, and transparent manner.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[4]:\nTITLE: Botswana Elections 2024: Just But Unfair - Botswana Gazette\nURL: https://www.thegazette.news/features/botswana-elections-2024-just-but-unfair/\nCONTENT: Under proportional representation (PR), Botswana could achieve a more accurate reflection of voter support in its National Assembly, enhancing democratic legitimacy and fairness. In contrast, the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) received 31% of the popular vote yet won only 4 seats, demonstrating how FPTP magnifies majorities in certain constituencies but fails to represent actual voter support across the nation. Our FPTP system has created a significant imbalance between the percentage of votes received by each party and their representation in the National Assembly. With PR, each vote carries equal weight, making the National Assembly a true reflection of Botswana’s diverse political landscape and a fairer platform for representation.\n--------------------------------------------------\n[5]:\nTITLE: Botswana opposition wins election; BDP ousted from power after 58 years\nURL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/botswanas-ruling-party-loses-power-after-six-decades-early-results-show\nCONTENT: Botswana opposition wins election; BDP ousted from power after 58 years. ...

In a stark contrast to Botswana’s peaceful journey to independence, countries like South Africa, Mozambique, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) endured protracted and violent struggles against colonial and oppressive regimes. The political systems currently in place in Botswana stand in stark contrast to those of other SADC countries that experienced violent struggles for independence, such as Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The peaceful transition of power in Botswana, a country long viewed as a stable democracy, may offer a blueprint for change in neighboring nations that have been struggling with authoritarian regimes and human rights violations.\n--------------------------------------------------Query: Botswana 2024 election retiring MPs\nSearch Results:\n--------------------------------------------------\n[1]:\nTITLE: Botswana General Elections 2024 Begin - africauptodate.com\nURL: https://www.africauptodate.com/botswana-general-elections-2024-begin\nCONTENT: Botswana General Elections 2024 Begin May 2024 (12) 12 posts May 2023 (13) 13 posts May 2022 (8) 8 posts May 2021 (27) 27 posts Africa (303)303 posts AfricaNews (67)67 posts Commentaries (20)20 posts Debates (1)1 post Sports (51)51 posts World News (49)49 posts All Posts Botswana General Elections 2024 Begin That is because by the country's electoral system, next president is not elected directly by voters but rather later by 61 new MPs they elect during general elections.

The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) took the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to court, which led to postponements of voter registration in November, as the UDC sought permission to deploy registration observers <citation>https://trendsnafrica.com/voter-registration-for-2024-general-elections-starts-in-botswana/</citation>. This legal challenge underscores the importance the UDC placed on ensuring transparency and preventing potential irregularities during voter registration.\n\nClaims of poll rigging have also been a recurring concern. In 2019, the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) made claims of poll rigging ahead of the general election, which Botswana’s election commission warned against <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-electoral-body-warns-opposition-about-rigging-claims/7826626.html</citation>. These allegations highlight the need for robust oversight and impartial monitoring to maintain public trust in the electoral system.\n\nTo ensure a fair and transparent election, the African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) was deployed to Botswana for the 2019 general election following an invitation from the Government of Botswana and the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) <citation>https://www.eisa.org/pdf/bot2019au.pdf</citation>. The AUEOM's presence and engagement with various stakeholders, including the IEC, political parties, candidates, and civil society, played a crucial role in promoting confidence in the electoral process.",

Since gaining independence in 1966, Botswana had been governed by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>. However, the 2024 election saw the BDP lose power after nearly six decades of dominance, signaling a significant shift in the country's political landscape <citation>https://apnews.com/article/botswana-election-masisi-concedes-80951b62fdb7169f073c2b13acaff1b6</citation>.\n\nThe main contenders in the election were the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), led by Duma Boko, and the incumbent Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), led by President Mokgweetsi Masisi <citation>https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024</citation>. Other parties that participated in the election included the Botswana Congress Party (BCP) and the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) <citation>https://www.idea.int/democracytracker/report/botswana/october-2024</citation>.\n\nThis report will delve into the key aspects of the 2024 Botswana election, including the factors that led to the BDP's defeat, the campaign promises of the UDC, and the implications of the power transition for Botswana's future. It will also examine the election results, the composition of the new cabinet, and the challenges and opportunities facing the new administration. The peaceful transfer of power in Botswana serves as an example of a successful democratic transition, and this report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of this historic event <citation>https://eng.fatshimetrie.org/2024/11/04/botswanas-historic-political-transition-in-2024/</citation>.\n## Results\n\nThe 2024 Botswana general election marked a historic shift in the country's political landscape, ending nearly six decades of dominance by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) since independence in 1966 <citation>https://apnews.com/article/botswana-election-masisi-concedes-80951b62fdb7169f073c2b13acaff1b6</citation>, <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/botswanas-ruling-party-loses-power-after-six-decades-early-results-show</citation>. President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat to Duma Boko of the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) <citation>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-opposition-party-wins-overwhelming-majority-in-botswana-election/</citation>. Voter turnout in the 2024 parliamentary elections was 81% <citation>https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024</citation>.\n\nThe Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) secured a majority in the National Assembly, winning 36 out of the 61 seats <citation>https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024</citation>. Other parties' results were as follows: the Botswana Congress Party (BCP) secured 15 seats, becoming the second-largest party in the National Assembly <citation>https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024</citation>, <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82945</citation>; the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) obtained 5 seats <citation>https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024</citation>, <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82945</citation>; and the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) won only 4 parliamentary seats <citation>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c238n5zr51yo</citation>, <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82945</citation>. An independent candidate, Dr. Edwin Dikoloti, won one seat <citation>https://www.mewc.org/index.php/tools/political-participation-a-election-monitroing/2024-elections-monitoring/12395-botswana-parliamentary-elections-2024</citation>.\n\nThe 2024 election results have initiated discussions about representation and potential electoral reforms in Botswana <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>, which currently uses the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) majority system for National Assembly and Local Government elections <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>. The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) received 31% of the popular vote but won only 4 seats, highlighting the imbalances of the FPTP system <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/features/botswana-elections-2024-just-but-unfair/</citation>. The Gallagher Index could be used to measure the proportionality of parliamentary seats won in the 2024 election.\n## Voter registration\n\nIn Botswana, any citizen aged 18 years and above is eligible to register to vote in national and local government elections <citation>https://www.wikiprocedure.com/index.php?title=Botswana_-_Obtain_a_Voters_card</citation>. To register, eligible citizens must possess a valid National Identity Card (Omang) <citation>https://www.gov.bw/voting/voter-registration</citation> and Voter Registration Card <citation>https://www.iec.gov.bw/index.php/elections.html</citation>. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) conducts voter registration, often announcing general registration periods <citation>https://www.gov.bw/voting/voter-registration</citation>. During these periods, citizens can visit a Registration Officer with their Omang, who will then complete a registration form <citation>https://www.gov.bw/voting/voter-registration</citation>.\n\nFor the 2024 general elections, voter registration commenced on January 5 and concluded on February 3, 2024 <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/iec-records-a-decline-in-registered-voters/news</citation>, <citation>https://newsinvasion24.com/botswana-wraps-up-voter-registration-for-2024-elections/</citation>. By the end of the registration period, a total of 1,038,275 voters had registered, marking an increase of 112,800 from the 2019 elections <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/over-one-million-voters-for-2024-elections/</citation>. The IEC aimed for 80% voter registration, targeting 1.3 million voters <citation>https://guardiansun.co.bw/news/politics/voter-registration-challenges-undermine-elections-integrity</citation>, <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/iec-exceeds-historic-1-million-mark-in-voter-registration/</citation>.\n\nA voter who wishes to transfer their registration to a different polling station must bring their current Voter's Registration Card to a Registration Officer in the constituency where the new polling station is located <citation>https://cms2.gov.bw/voting/voter-registration-transfer</citation>. Voter registration cards are valid indefinitely, except when a voter transfers registration to a new electoral area <citation>https://www.wikiprocedure.com/index.php/Botswana_-_Register_as_Voter</citation>.\n### Background of opposition parties before the election\n\nBotswana has been a multi-party state since independence in 1966, but the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has been the dominant force in the country's politics, holding power since 1969 <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/botswana-election-who-is-in-the-running-and-whats-at-stake</citation>. However, the opposition parties have been challenging the BDP's dominance, especially in recent years <citation>https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2024-elections/botswana/</citation>. Historically, the opposition has been fragmented and weak, but has experienced an upswell in confidence since its victory in the 2022 by-elections <citation>https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2024-elections/botswana/</citation>. If the opposition parties are able to overcome factionalism and slightly increase their popular support, 2024 may mark the end of a 57-year legacy of the BDP’s rule in Botswana <citation>https://blog.bti-project.org/2024/08/29/a-bumpy-road-ahead-botswana-faces-economic-and-political-struggles-ahead-of-its-2024-general-elections/</citation>.\n\nThe Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), a coalition formed in the lead-up to the 2019 elections and led by Duma Boko, represented the strongest challenge to the BDP <citation>https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2024-elections/botswana/</citation>. In the 2019 election, the UDC more than doubled its share of seats, from 15 to 36 <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/elections/elections/</citation>. Other key opposition parties included the Botswana Congress Party (BCP), led by Mr. Dumelang Saleshando <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/elections/elections/</citation>, the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), which was formed just before the 2019 election by former President Ian Khama <citation>https://nation.africa/africa/news/-botswana-s-election-shock-why-voters-kicked-the-ruling-party-out-after-58-years-4821024</citation>, and the Alliance for Progressives (AP).\n\nBotswana operates under a First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system, which has been criticized for disadvantaging smaller parties <citation>https://freedomhouse.org/country/botswana/freedom-world/2025</citation>. This system can magnify majorities in certain constituencies but fails to represent actual voter support across the nation <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/features/botswana-elections-2024-just-but-unfair/</citation>.\n### Composition of parliament\n\nThe Botswana Parliament is unicameral, consisting of the National Assembly <citation>https://www.indexmundi.com/botswana/legislative_branch.html</citation>. The National Assembly has 63 seats, with 57 members directly elected from single-seat constituencies, utilizing the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>, <citation>https://www.indexmundi.com/botswana/legislative_branch.html</citation>. Additionally, 4 members are nominated by the President and indirectly elected by the National Assembly <citation>https://www.indexmundi.com/botswana/legislative_branch.html</citation>. The President and the Attorney General serve as ex-officio members <citation>https://www.indexmundi.com/botswana/legislative_branch.html</citation>. The 12th Parliament, which was in session from 2019 to 2024, was dissolved on September 5, 2024, by the President, in accordance with Section 91 (2) of the Constitution <citation>https://parliament.gov.bw/documents/PARLY-SPREAD-2024F_01_25_02_18_09_2024.pdf</citation>.\n\nIn the 2019-2024 parliament, four women were selected as specially elected MPs; however, only three women are in the current parliament, bringing women's representation to six out of 67 <citation>https://theconversation.com/women-in-botswana-make-up-54-of-voters-but-less-than-10-of-parliament-political-parties-can-change-that-244527</citation>, <citation>https://www.pressreader.com/botswana/botswana-guardian/20241220/281814289466634</citation>.\n\nA new constitutional amendment mandates that Members of Parliament (MPs) resign if they switch parties mid-term, aiming to stabilize governance and respect voter mandates <citation>https://www.africa-press.net/botswana/all-news/floor-crossing-ban-reshapes-political-accountability</citation>, <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/floor-crossing-ban-reshapes-political-accountability/</citation>.\n### Previous election\n\nThe 2019 Botswana general election saw the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) secure victory, winning 29 national assembly seats and representing 51 percent of the vote <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/25/botswanas-ruling-party-bdp-wins-general-election-chief-justice/</citation>. The election marked the first time Mokgweetsi Masisi led the BDP as president, having succeeded Ian Khama in 2018 <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20191023/</citation>.\n\nThe BDP's popular vote surged from 46.7% to 66.66% in the 2019 election <citation>https://www.politicalanalysis.co.za/botswanas-ruling-party-wins-37-of-the-57-parliamentary-seats/</citation>, allowing them to retain a majority in the 65-member National Assembly with 38 of the 57 seats at stake <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20191023/</citation>.\n\nThe 2019 election was significantly influenced by former President Ian Khama <citation>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03057070.2020.1778901</citation>. In the run-up to the election, a power struggle erupted within the ruling BDP <citation>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/botswana/politics-2019.htm</citation>, and Khama, who left the ruling party, backed the opposition <citation>https://mg.co.za/article/2019-10-17-khamas-hand-still-rocks-botswana/</citation>.\n\nThe 2019 Botswana elections were marred by allegations of irregularity <citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/udc-working-on-strategies-to-prevent-election-rigging/news</citation>. Forensics for Justice claimed to have evidence that the election was fraudulently rigged to favor the BDP, allegedly assisted by intelligence services <citation>https://www.biznews.com/global-citizen/2019/12/05/botswana-election-rigged-forensics-justice</citation>. The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) also made claims of poll rigging ahead of the election <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-electoral-body-warns-opposition-about-rigging-claims/7826626.html</citation>. Following the elections, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) faced numerous legal challenges in the form of election petitions due to the non-acceptance of election results <citation>https://www.iec.gov.bw/images/Stakeholders+REPORT_Feb+26+2021.pdf</citation>. The UDC challenged the election results in court for 16 parliamentary constituencies won by the BDP <citation>https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/botswana-opposition-challenges-election-result-in-court-2019-11-26</citation>.\n\nThe African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) was deployed to Botswana for the 2019 general election <citation>https://www.eisa.org/pdf/bot2019au.pdf</citation> and commended the IEC for providing voter information on Election Day, such as displaying names and symbols of contesting parties and independent candidates at polling stations <citation>https://www.eisa.org/pdf/bot2019au.pdf</citation>.\n### Seat redistribution\n\nThe redistribution of parliamentary seats in Botswana is a critical process for ensuring fair and effective representation, mandated by Section 64.1 of the Constitution of Botswana <citation>https://www.botswanayouth.com/delimination-commission-hands-over-report-to-president-masisi/</citation>. This task is carried out by the Delimitation Commission, which is appointed by the Judicial Service Commission following the receipt of the National Population Census Report <citation>https://enews.mmegi.bw/article/281535114590127</citation>.\n\nThe Delimitation Commission, established on May 13, 2022, and sworn in on May 27, 2022 <citation>https://www.botswanayouth.com/delimination-commission-hands-over-report-to-president-masisi/</citation>, undertakes extensive consultations to gather input from various stakeholders. In 2022, the commission visited 104 places and held 106 consultation meetings, engaging with communities at kgotlas and community halls <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/71386</citation>, <citation>https://www.botswanayouth.com/delimination-commission-hands-over-report-to-president-masisi/</citation>. These consultations are vital for understanding local dynamics and ensuring that the proposed redistributions reflect the needs and concerns of the population. The 2022 Delimitation Commission report is accessible to the public online <citation>https://www.facebook.com/iecbotswana/posts/the-public-is-informed-that-you-can-now-access-the-2022-delimitation-commission-/529954135990631/</citation>, <citation>https://www.iec.gov.bw/images/2022_Delimitation_Final_Report.pdf</citation>.\n\nOne notable outcome of the Delimitation Commission's work is the splitting of Mogoditshane constituency due to its growing population <citation>https://enews.mmegi.bw/article/281543705100000</citation>. This decision reflects the commission's mandate to ensure that each constituency represents a roughly equal number of people, promoting the principle of \"one person, one vote.\" The chairperson of the Delimitation Commission was Judge Mokwadi Chris Gabanagae <citation>https://enews.mmegi.bw/article/281535114590127</citation>.\n### MPs not standing for re-election\n\nSeveral Members of Parliament (MPs) concluded their political careers after the recent parliamentary session, either due to losses in primary elections or by opting for retirement <citation>https://thepatriot.co.bw/adios-to-retiring-mps/</citation>. This exodus was particularly noticeable among MPs from the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), often spurred by losses in the Bulela Ditswe primary elections, which paved the way for new faces <citation>https://thepatriot.co.bw/adios-to-retiring-mps/</citation>.\n\nNotable examples include Edwin Batshu, the former Police Commissioner, who completed two terms as the MP for Nkange <citation>https://thepatriot.co.bw/adios-to-retiring-mps/</citation>. Kgosi Tawana Moremi II, the Maun West legislator, also added to the list of retiring MPs <citation>https://thepatriot.co.bw/adios-to-retiring-mps/</citation>. Additionally, Eric Molale, the MP for Good Hope/Mabule, announced that he would not seek re-election, citing old age as the reason, after serving in public service for over 40 years <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/77452</citation>,<citation>https://thepatriot.co.bw/molale-throws-in-the-towel-2/</citation>. Mpho Balopi, the incumbent MP for Gaborone North, had also announced his decision not to participate in the 2024 general elections <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/animosity-rises-as-bdp-primaries-near/</citation>, which led to him vacating his parliamentary seat and the office of BDP Secretary General <citation>https://thevoicebw.com/set-to-cruise/</citation>. Pono Moatlhodi, the MP for Tonota, also announced his intention to retire from active politics at the end of his term in 2024 <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/69649</citation>. Dr. Thapelo Matsheka, the former MP for Lobatse, declared he would not vie for any position at the Botswana Democratic Party's upcoming congress <citation>https://thevoicebw.com/matsheka-bows-out-of-bdp-succession-race/</citation>.\n### Presidential nominees\n\nThe High Court of Botswana confirmed four presidential candidates for the 2024 general election: Mokgweetsi Masisi, the candidate for the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-leader-3-from-opposition-confirmed-as-presidential-candidates-/7804891.html</citation>; Duma Boko, leader of the opposition coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-leader-3-from-opposition-confirmed-as-presidential-candidates-/7804891.html</citation>; Dumelang Saleshando of the Botswana Congress Party (BCP) <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-leader-3-from-opposition-confirmed-as-presidential-candidates-/7804891.html</citation>; and Mephato Reatile from the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-leader-3-from-opposition-confirmed-as-presidential-candidates-/7804891.html</citation>.\n\nThe presidential nomination process was conducted in accordance with the constitution and under the supervision of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/81985</citation>. The presidential nomination court convened on September 28, 2024, at the Gaborone High Court <citation>https://povonews.com/botswanas-2024-general-elections-to-be-held-on-october-30/</citation>. The Chief Justice of Botswana serves as the returning officer for presidential elections, as stipulated by Sections 32 and 38 of the Constitution and Section 2 of the Presidential Elections Act <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/77718</citation>.\n\nHowever, Biggie Butale, leader of the Botswana Republican Party (BRP), failed to meet the legal requirements for nomination and was therefore not confirmed as a presidential candidate <citation>https://yourbotswana.com/2024/10/01/botswana-leader-3-from-opposition-confirmed-as-presidential-candidates/</citation>, <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82038</citation>.\n### Observation controversy\n\nThe 2024 Botswana general election was not without controversy, particularly concerning the observation of the electoral process. The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) took the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to court, which led to postponements of voter registration in November, as the UDC sought permission to deploy registration observers <citation>https://trendsnafrica.com/voter-registration-for-2024-general-elections-starts-in-botswana/</citation>. This legal challenge underscores the importance the UDC placed on ensuring transparency and preventing potential irregularities during voter registration.\n\nClaims of poll rigging have also been a recurring concern. In 2019, the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) made claims of poll rigging ahead of the general election, which Botswana’s election commission warned against <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-electoral-body-warns-opposition-about-rigging-claims/7826626.html</citation>. These allegations highlight the need for robust oversight and impartial monitoring to maintain public trust in the electoral system.\n\nTo ensure a fair and transparent election, the African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) was deployed to Botswana for the 2019 general election following an invitation from the Government of Botswana and the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) <citation>https://www.eisa.org/pdf/bot2019au.pdf</citation>. The AUEOM's presence and engagement with various stakeholders, including the IEC, political parties, candidates, and civil society, played a crucial role in promoting confidence in the electoral process.",
