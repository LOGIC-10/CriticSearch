Recent events suggest that Hezbollah's military capabilities and influence are waning due to targeted Israeli military actions that have disrupted their strategic positioning. This has led to a realignment in power dynamics, with Kurdish territories facing threats and broader regional tensions escalating. Additionally, Hezbollah's operational activities, particularly against Israel, reflect ongoing conflicts that affect the stability of the region. The group's actions in October 2023 illustrate their resilience and strategic intentions to keep pressure on Israel, signaling to other regional actors their continued presence and determination.\n\nThese developments impact alliances, with countries like Iran and Syria experiencing shifts in their strategies due to weakened influence of Hezbollah. Moreover, regional powers such as Turkey are reasserting influence through strategic military cooperation with Syrian authorities, further contributing to the changing landscape. Understanding Hezbollah's role and the shifts in alliances helps in comprehensively analyzing the current power dynamics in the Middle East and any potential implications for future engagements. This will be encapsulated in the following analysis section.\n\nThe search results provide a comprehensive set of details regarding the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives.

Hezbollah's operational strategies, as evident in the escalation of hostilities with Israel, showcase both their resilience and the pressure they aim to maintain on Israel. Notably, Hezbollah's attacks on Israeli radar sites and other military installations on October 8, 2023, demonstrate their strategic intent to challenge Israeli defenses, thereby reminding regional actors of its military readiness and capacity for sustained conflict <citation>https://www.setav.org/en/focus/a-storm-of-conflict-analyzing-the-israel-hezbollah-conflict-post-october-2023</citation>.\n\nNonetheless, Hezbollah's military power is waning, largely due to effective Israeli military campaigns aimed at weakening its regional influence. This has opened up new threats to other territories, including Kurdish areas, reflecting broader tensions and a shift in regional power alignments <citation>https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-832881</citation>. The decline in Hezbollah's influence is intricately linked to Syria's unstable condition and the effectiveness of Israel's strategic military interventions.\n\nMoreover, Hezbollah's predicament further complicates Iran's regional strategy, compelling a recalibration of the broader 'axis of resistance' that underpins Iran’s regional ambitions. Syria, having been a pivotal ally, is grappling with internal challenges that have ripple effects on Hezbollah's operations and Iran's strategic depth <citation>https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-831956</citation>. In the midst of this, Turkey's proactive engagement with Syrian military operations is indicative of its intent to assert influence amidst the regional instability, further adding to the complex geopolitical shifts<sup>[1]</sup>.\n\nThese developments underscore a reordering of alliances and power structures within the Middle East, forecasting a potentially volatile yet transformative period for regional geopolitics. The interplay between these forces will likely define the strategic contours of the Middle East beyond 2023, laying the groundwork for new alliances and potential confrontations.\n\n---\n\n<sup>[1]</sup> Please note: This footnote placeholder represents where citation URLs from the memo notes would be placed directly in a formal analysis.",

Violations and implementation challenges continue to pose threats to its success. Furthermore, multiple search results, including notes, suggest that despite the ceasefire, tensions persist between the involved parties, influenced by broader geopolitical motives and strategic interests of Russia, Turkey, and other regional and international players.

        "action_content": "## Background\n\nOn March 5, 2020, a significant ceasefire agreement was established between Russia and Turkey to de-escalate the conflict in Syria's north-western Idlib province. This ceasefire, formulated after extensive talks in Moscow between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, aimed to put a halt to the escalating violence that had jeopardized understanding between the two countries over Syria. The agreement called for a 6-km \"security corridor\" along the M4 highway, though its implementation has faced complications with continued ceasefire violations reported in the region <citation>https://www.refugeesinternational.org/events-and-testimony/the-crisis-in-idlib/</citation>.\n\nThe underlying motivations for the ceasefire were strongly tied to the strategic interests of both Russia and Turkey. For Russia, maintaining influence in Syria remains critical for its geopolitical strategy in the Middle East, while Turkey sought to curb a growing humanitarian crisis on its borders and to prevent further refugee flows into its territory <citation>https://www.inss.org.il/publication/turkey-and-the-ceasefire-in-idlib/</citation>. Despite the ceasefire, Turkey retained the right to retaliate against any attacks by Syrian government forces, highlighting the fragile nature of this agreement <citation>https://abcnews.go.com/International/turkey-russia-agree-ceasefire-syrias-idlib-province/story?id=69415547</citation>.\n\nCompounding the intricacy of the situation in Idlib is the role of various factions involved in Syria's civil war. Notably, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), previously aligned with al-Qaeda, has become a dominant force in the region. This group's presence, alongside other rebel factions, continues to complicate peace efforts, as its actions and alliances affect the dynamics of power in northern Syria and impacts efforts for a lasting peace <citation>https://www.mei.edu/publications/russia-iran-and-competition-shape-syrias-future</citation>.\n\nThus, the March 2020 ceasefire agreement, while a step towards de-escalation, underscores the deep-seated complexities within the regional power play, adding layers to the conflict in Idlib that resonate throughout the overall Syrian theatre. The sustainability of peace in Idlib hinges on the delicate balance of regional and international interests, as well as the evolving positions of local power factions embedded within the landscape of the Syrian civil war.",

The offensive, supported by various Syrian anti-Assad factions and opposition rebel groups, marked a pivotal moment in the Syrian civil war, leading to the capture of strategic territory such as Aleppo from government forces <citation>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/op-rada-al-adwan-20241127.htm</citation>.\n\nHTS's military campaign capitalized on strategic alliances with the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army and other opposition factions, allowing them to seize significant regions, thus diminishing the territorial control held by the Assad regime. The operation altered the longstanding front lines in Syria's northwest, which had been relatively static in recent years. The impact of this offensive extends beyond immediate military gains; it reflects HTS’s growing prominence and aims to reshape the regional power balance, signaling potential future confrontations with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) <citation>https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15919.doc.htm</citation>.\n\nThe gains made by HTS have reverberated through the political landscape, prompting reactions from various international stakeholders who view these developments as a strategic opportunity to weaken the Assad regime and explore new diplomatic engagements in the region <citation>https://english.geo-strategic.com/2024/12/the-future-of-hayat-tahrir-al-sham-in.html</citation>.

The preservation of these bases enables Russia to maintain its influence and assert its power in regional affairs, effectively balancing against Western interests <citation>https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2025/03/09/russia-retains-strategic-coastal-syria-bases-amidst-renewed-violence/</citation>.\n\nRussia's continued presence underscores the intricate web of alliances and oppositions that define the Syrian theatre. This involvement not only reflects its historical ties with Syria but also acts to counterbalance Turkey's influence and the advancing Syrian opposition factions, which have started to reshape the country's political landscape. Moscow's diplomatic efforts, while advocating for stability, are oriented towards forestalling the complete dissolution of its regional investments and ensuring that pro-Russian elements hold sway in any ensuing government structure <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nThus, Russia's military engagements and strategic positioning are central to understanding the current Middle Eastern dynamics, particularly as they pertain to power shifts in Syria and broader regional implications.",

        "action_content": "### Turkey's Role in Syria\n\nTurkey's involvement in the Syrian Civil War has been marked by tactical maneuvers aimed at enlarging its geopolitical influence and quelling Kurdish aspirations along its southern border. Since the early 2010s, Turkey has supported Syrian opposition groups, viewing the Assad regime's collapse as pivotal to its regional strategy. The Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and its collaboration with Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have been central to recent opposition offensives that overthrew Assad. This offensive resurgence, which Turkey reportedly supported, has created both opportunities and challenges for Ankara, including managing its complex relationship with HTS and mitigating the Kurdish threat poised by groups like the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) <citation>https://www.stimson.org/2024/what-turkey-hopes-to-gain-from-the-hts-offensive-in-syria</citation> <citation>https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-turkey-aims-capitalise-syrias-rebel-offensive</citation>.\n\nTurkey’s persistent denial of formal support for the HTS-led offensive highlights diplomatic intricacies as Turkish leaders strive to maintain conceivable deniability amidst international scrutiny <citation>https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/turkiye-rejects-claims-it-backed-hts-in-syrias-anti-regime-offensive</citation>.

Given the geopolitical sensitivities involving Russia, Iran, and Syria, Turkey must maneuver its policies to sustain and expand its influence. Turkey's stance in global conflicts, such as its military and economic assertions concerning Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean, shapes its regional relations, including those with Ukraine, where it seeks to balance NATO partnerships with pragmatic ties to Russia.\n\nThe approach towards Ukraine underscores Turkey’s attempts to leverage economic partnerships and military cooperation as thrusts for regional stability and sustained growth. This dynamic indicates Turkey's broader strategy to transcend geographical confines through strategic foreign engagements, situating itself as a critical player in both Middle Eastern and broader Eurasian geopolitics <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.",

Analyzing the Syrian government's perspective, we can see that since the conflict began in 2011, the government has consistently portrayed opposition forces as terrorists, a narrative supported by their long-term allies: Iran and Russia [9]. The labels used by the government serve to delegitimize the insurgents and justify harsh military responses. These allies, particularly Russia and Iran, have been instrumental in maintaining government control over significant portions of Syria, reinforcing the narrative of fighting against terrorism and foreign-backed insurgents [6].\n\nThe presence of significant local support for government forces, especially in provinces like Latakia and Tartous, emphasizes the government's hold over Alawite-dominated regions. This has necessitated sophisticated counterinsurgency efforts from both the Syrian government and their allies to maintain control over these territories[4]. Furthermore, the government's perspective has been colored by the substantial Iranian and Russian backing it receives, which is integral to maintaining the current regime's survival [10].\n\nIn this context, understanding the domestic situation involves looking at the Syrian government's stance as both a political and militaristic effort to stabilize the country amid ongoing conflicts and insurgencies. The government's long-standing narrative of terrorism and foreign intervention shapes their internal policies and military strategies [9]. This positioning is crucial for maintaining legitimacy and garner support from international allies that have vested interests in the region's stability.\n\nBased on these observations, the next section of the report will focus on outlining the domestic aspects of Syria's ongoing conflict, providing insight into the government's perspective, actions, and the broader strategic role of their alliances with countries such as Russia and Iran.\n\nThe search results provide a comprehensive overview of the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives, including detailed information about the key events, key players, specific offensives, and strategic shifts.

The government has consistently labeled opposition forces as terrorists, a narrative designed to delegitimize the insurgency and justify military responses aimed at establishing control [9]. This perspective is bolstered by the support of key allies such as Iran and Russia, who have provided indispensable military and political backing.\n\nIran and Russia's involvement extends beyond military support; it is fundamental to the government's survival and strategic operations. Russian and Iranian contributions have facilitated the recapture of territories once held by opposition factions and enabled the Syrian government to maintain its presence in strategically vital regions [6]. The importance of these regions, particularly those with strong Alawite support like Latakia and Tartous, underscores the government's efforts to secure internal stability through a robust counterinsurgency approach [4].\n\nThe Syrian government's perspective on domestic conflict is intertwined with broader geopolitical interests. The relationship with its allies directly influences internal policy and the conduct of military operations, reinforcing the government's narrative against insurgency and terrorism [10]. Aligning with these foreign powers not only solidifies internal control but also projects the image of a resilient state combating terrorism, thereby justifying continued military engagement domestically and internationally.\n\nThrough its domestic policies, the Syrian government aims to assert control, project strength, and maintain allegiance from both local and international actors.

The abrupt fall of the regime in December 2024, as highlighted in the search results, has led to a reevaluation of foreign policies, especially for major stakeholders such as the EU, Iran, and Russia.\n\nThe EU, as depicted in the search results, is seen to be taking proactive measures to support Syria's transition to an inclusive political process. This is evinced by the EU's suspension of restrictive measures against the former regime and its financial commitment of €2.5 billion to support Syria and the region through this transition period. Furthermore, EU leaders are keen to assist Syrian-led initiatives that promise to foster security and stability in the region without external extremist influences.\n\nThe search results and notes also indicate skepticism among EU leaders regarding potential Islamist leanings within the new Syrian regime. These geopolitical dynamics affect not only regional security but also the EU's own internal policies, such as the temporary suspension of Syrian asylum applications by several EU member states due to uncertainty regarding the country's stability post-regime change.\n\nGiven this context, discussing the international reactions to these events involves understanding the roles of Iran and Russia, traditionally staunch allies of Assad, and their recalibrated approaches following the regime's downfall.

The search results from Reuters and Al Arabiya consistently indicate that the ceasefire was generally holding, although reports from sources like Al-Monitor mention a collapse in certain areas due to actions by Turkish-backed factions.\n\n2. **Military Activities and Tensions**: Despite the ceasefire, the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) initiated actions against Kurdish groups, and military tensions remained high, especially around key areas like Manbij and Kobani. This is shown by news sources like Firstpost and Al Jazeera, reporting ongoing violence and military buildups.\n\n3. **Political and Strategic Dynamics**: The political landscape is also crucial as Turkey continues to oppose Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria, fearing Kurdish militancy along its border. Turkiye's stance reflects underlying political tensions, as highlighted by multiple reports, including those noting Turkey's denial of ceasefire agreements with Kurdish forces.\n\n4. **External Influence and Mediation**: The United States played a significant role in brokering and allegedly extending ceasefires. However, the durability of these agreements was threatened by differing commitments and agendas, particularly from Turkey and Kurdish forces. \n\nGiven these points, the \"Immediate aftermath\" section will focus on describing the status and implications of the ceasefire initiated between Turkey and the SDF, how military and political tensions persisted despite the ceasefire, and the external mediation efforts that influence the dynamics on the ground.\n\nThe search results provide substantial information regarding the Syrian opposition offensives, especially focusing on the dynamics between Turkish-backed forces and the SDF.

        "final_report": "## Analysis\n\nThe Middle Eastern power dynamics have experienced marked changes in 2023, significantly influenced by Hezbollah's shifting role and the responses it has elicited from regional actors. Hezbollah's operational strategies, as evident in the escalation of hostilities with Israel, showcase both their resilience and the pressure they aim to maintain on Israel. Notably, Hezbollah's attacks on Israeli radar sites and other military installations on October 8, 2023, demonstrate their strategic intent to challenge Israeli defenses, thereby reminding regional actors of its military readiness and capacity for sustained conflict <citation>https://www.setav.org/en/focus/a-storm-of-conflict-analyzing-the-israel-hezbollah-conflict-post-october-2023</citation>.\n\nNonetheless, Hezbollah's military power is waning, largely due to effective Israeli military campaigns aimed at weakening its regional influence. This has opened up new threats to other territories, including Kurdish areas, reflecting broader tensions and a shift in regional power alignments <citation>https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-832881</citation>. The decline in Hezbollah's influence is intricately linked to Syria's unstable condition and the effectiveness of Israel's strategic military interventions.\n\nMoreover, Hezbollah's predicament further complicates Iran's regional strategy, compelling a recalibration of the broader 'axis of resistance' that underpins Iran’s regional ambitions. Syria, having been a pivotal ally, is grappling with internal challenges that have ripple effects on Hezbollah's operations and Iran's strategic depth <citation>https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-831956</citation>. In the midst of this, Turkey's proactive engagement with Syrian military operations is indicative of its intent to assert influence amidst the regional instability, further adding to the complex geopolitical shifts<sup>[1]</sup>.\n\nThese developments underscore a reordering of alliances and power structures within the Middle East, forecasting a potentially volatile yet transformative period for regional geopolitics. The interplay between these forces will likely define the strategic contours of the Middle East beyond 2023, laying the groundwork for new alliances and potential confrontations.\n\n---\n\n<sup>[1]</sup> Please note: This footnote placeholder represents where citation URLs from the memo notes would be placed directly in a formal analysis.\n## Background\n\nOn March 5, 2020, a significant ceasefire agreement was established between Russia and Turkey to de-escalate the conflict in Syria's north-western Idlib province. This ceasefire, formulated after extensive talks in Moscow between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, aimed to put a halt to the escalating violence that had jeopardized understanding between the two countries over Syria. The agreement called for a 6-km \"security corridor\" along the M4 highway, though its implementation has faced complications with continued ceasefire violations reported in the region <citation>https://www.refugeesinternational.org/events-and-testimony/the-crisis-in-idlib/</citation>.\n\nThe underlying motivations for the ceasefire were strongly tied to the strategic interests of both Russia and Turkey. For Russia, maintaining influence in Syria remains critical for its geopolitical strategy in the Middle East, while Turkey sought to curb a growing humanitarian crisis on its borders and to prevent further refugee flows into its territory <citation>https://www.inss.org.il/publication/turkey-and-the-ceasefire-in-idlib/</citation>. Despite the ceasefire, Turkey retained the right to retaliate against any attacks by Syrian government forces, highlighting the fragile nature of this agreement <citation>https://abcnews.go.com/International/turkey-russia-agree-ceasefire-syrias-idlib-province/story?id=69415547</citation>.\n\nCompounding the intricacy of the situation in Idlib is the role of various factions involved in Syria's civil war. Notably, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), previously aligned with al-Qaeda, has become a dominant force in the region. This group's presence, alongside other rebel factions, continues to complicate peace efforts, as its actions and alliances affect the dynamics of power in northern Syria and impacts efforts for a lasting peace <citation>https://www.mei.edu/publications/russia-iran-and-competition-shape-syrias-future</citation>.\n\nThus, the March 2020 ceasefire agreement, while a step towards de-escalation, underscores the deep-seated complexities within the regional power play, adding layers to the conflict in Idlib that resonate throughout the overall Syrian theatre. The sustainability of peace in Idlib hinges on the delicate balance of regional and international interests, as well as the evolving positions of local power factions embedded within the landscape of the Syrian civil war.\n## Offensive\n\nIn November 2024, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) initiated a significant military offensive aimed at expanding its territorial control from its stronghold in the Idlib region to the Aleppo province. This operation was part of a broader strategy known as \"Deterrence of Aggression,\" intended not only as a countermeasure against the Syrian regime's actions but also to bolster HTS’s influence across northwestern Syria. The offensive, supported by various Syrian anti-Assad factions and opposition rebel groups, marked a pivotal moment in the Syrian civil war, leading to the capture of strategic territory such as Aleppo from government forces <citation>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/op-rada-al-adwan-20241127.htm</citation>.\n\nHTS's military campaign capitalized on strategic alliances with the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army and other opposition factions, allowing them to seize significant regions, thus diminishing the territorial control held by the Assad regime. The operation altered the longstanding front lines in Syria's northwest, which had been relatively static in recent years. The impact of this offensive extends beyond immediate military gains; it reflects HTS’s growing prominence and aims to reshape the regional power balance, signaling potential future confrontations with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) <citation>https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15919.doc.htm</citation>.\n\nThe gains made by HTS have reverberated through the political landscape, prompting reactions from various international stakeholders who view these developments as a strategic opportunity to weaken the Assad regime and explore new diplomatic engagements in the region <citation>https://english.geo-strategic.com/2024/12/the-future-of-hayat-tahrir-al-sham-in.html</citation>. As the group solidifies its position, questions about its long-term objectives and the sustainability of its control remain critical for understanding the future dynamics of the Syrian conflict.\n## Preface\n\nIn December 2024, Syria witnessed a seismic shift in its history as Bashar al-Assad's regime was toppled in a swift offensive led by opposition groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army (SNA). These operations marked the culmination of a long-standing struggle against dictatorship, bringing to an end the Assad dynasty's five-decade rule. The successful capture of key cities, including Damascus, Aleppo, and Hama, showcased the organized efforts of these opposition forces <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/opposition-fighters-take-syrian-capital-damascus</citation><citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/5/syrian-opposition-fighters-claim-to-have-entered-the-crucial-city-of-hama</citation>. The toppling of Assad has led to strategic opportunities for Turkey, a key player now actively engaging with the emerging Syrian administration <citation>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/new-war-syria-turkey-syrian-national-army-vs-us-syrian-democratic-forces-13844132.html</citation>. \n\nThe fall of Assad has not only altered the domestic political landscape but has also resulted in significant regional ramifications. It has diminished Iran and Russia's influence, despite their historical support for the Assad regime <citation>https://research.sharqforum.org/2024/12/17/domestic-regional-and-international-reactions-to-the-syrian-revolution/</citation>. At the same time, the new political dynamics open avenues for nations to reconsider their relations with Syria as the country begins the intricate process of rebuilding and navigating security challenges from extremist factions <citation>https://rcsgs.org/publications/blog/the-fall-of-bashar-al-assad-and-its-implications</citation>.\n\nThis transformative period in Syria's history demands a rigorous examination of not only the internal changes but also the international implications and future directions for the Middle East. As Syria embarks on this uncertain journey, the international community and regional stakeholders must forge pathways for dialogue and support, ensuring stability and development in the post-Assad era.\n\nAfter focusing on the ongoing military operations involving Israel and Hezbollah, it becomes essential to shift the lens towards Russia's role in the broader geopolitical matrix concerning Syria. Russia has been a pivotal player in the Syrian conflict, providing military support to the Assad regime. This involvement is crucial given the recent shifts in regional power dynamics, especially after the Syrian opposition's successful military campaigns.\n\nRussia's strategic interest in Syria is underscored by its refusal to let go of its military bases along the Syrian coast, particularly after the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime. Despite facing setbacks on other fronts, like their engagements in Ukraine, Russia remains intent on keeping its foothold in the Middle East via Syria. The preservation of these bases enables Russia to maintain its influence and assert its power in regional affairs, effectively balancing against Western interests <citation>https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2025/03/09/russia-retains-strategic-coastal-syria-bases-amidst-renewed-violence/</citation>.\n\nRussia's continued presence underscores the intricate web of alliances and oppositions that define the Syrian theatre. This involvement not only reflects its historical ties with Syria but also acts to counterbalance Turkey's influence and the advancing Syrian opposition factions, which have started to reshape the country's political landscape. Moscow's diplomatic efforts, while advocating for stability, are oriented towards forestalling the complete dissolution of its regional investments and ensuring that pro-Russian elements hold sway in any ensuing government structure <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\nThus, Russia's military engagements and strategic positioning are central to understanding the current Middle Eastern dynamics, particularly as they pertain to power shifts in Syria and broader regional implications.\n### Turkey's Role in Syria\n\nTurkey's involvement in the Syrian Civil War has been marked by tactical maneuvers aimed at enlarging its geopolitical influence and quelling Kurdish aspirations along its southern border. Since the early 2010s, Turkey has supported Syrian opposition groups, viewing the Assad regime's collapse as pivotal to its regional strategy. The Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and its collaboration with Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have been central to recent opposition offensives that overthrew Assad. This offensive resurgence, which Turkey reportedly supported, has created both opportunities and challenges for Ankara, including managing its complex relationship with HTS and mitigating the Kurdish threat poised by groups like the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) <citation>https://www.stimson.org/2024/what-turkey-hopes-to-gain-from-the-hts-offensive-in-syria</citation> <citation>https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-turkey-aims-capitalise-syrias-rebel-offensive</citation>.\n\nTurkey’s persistent denial of formal support for the HTS-led offensive highlights diplomatic intricacies as Turkish leaders strive to maintain conceivable deniability amidst international scrutiny <citation>https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/turkiye-rejects-claims-it-backed-hts-in-syrias-anti-regime-offensive</citation>. Nevertheless, the pivotal fall of Damascus to opposition forces marks a significant juncture, positioning Turkey to potentially exert substantial influence in shaping the future governance of Syria <citation>https://www.newarab.com/news/turkeys-erdogan-plans-first-visit-post-assad-syria</citation>.\n\n### Turkey's Strategic Interests and Relations with Ukraine\n\nParallel to its actions in Syria, Turkey's regional strategy includes fostering relations with nations like Ukraine. Given the geopolitical sensitivities involving Russia, Iran, and Syria, Turkey must maneuver its policies to sustain and expand its influence. Turkey's stance in global conflicts, such as its military and economic assertions concerning Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean, shapes its regional relations, including those with Ukraine, where it seeks to balance NATO partnerships with pragmatic ties to Russia.\n\nThe approach towards Ukraine underscores Turkey’s attempts to leverage economic partnerships and military cooperation as thrusts for regional stability and sustained growth. This dynamic indicates Turkey's broader strategy to transcend geographical confines through strategic foreign engagements, situating itself as a critical player in both Middle Eastern and broader Eurasian geopolitics <citation>https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2024-12-03/successful-offensive-syrian-opposition-forces-opportunity-turkey-and</citation>.\n\n\n\n### Fall of Damascus\n\nThe fall of Damascus marked a pivotal turning point in Syria’s prolonged civil conflict, culminating in the rapid collapse of the Assad regime in December 2024. Revolutionary forces, composed of a diversified coalition including the Syrian Free Army and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, launched a decisive offensive that dismantled the longstanding grip of Bashar al-Assad's government on the capital. This concluding push began with capturing key cities like Hama and ultimately led to the overthrow of Assad, as reported in state media announcements by opposition representatives following their entry into Damascus on December 8, 2024 <citation>https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Dec/08/syria-rebels-lightning-offensive-11-days-to-the-fall-of-damascus</citation>.\n\nThis lightning-fast advance prompted a tactical withdrawal of Assad’s forces, labeled as such by the regime in an attempt to mask its precipitous decline. The revolutionary forces swiftly overtook strategic regions such as Suwayda, Quneitra, and Daraa, pushing Assad’s defenses to the brink and forcing a reeling retreat <citation>https://levant24.com/news/2024/12/revolution-forces-advance-toward-damascus-as-assad-regime-crumbles/</citation>. The abrupt end to Assad’s rule was welcomed with celebratory demonstrations across Syria, as the Syrian people grasped the prospect of potential peace and renewal after years of war <citation>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/syria-civil-war-assad-fall-damascus-opposition/</citation>.\n\nGlobal reactions ranged from cautious optimism to strategic recalibration. Key international stakeholders, including Russia and Iran, faced a significant loss of influence, necessitating recalibrated approaches to maintain their geopolitical interests in a post-Assad Syria <citation>https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-831956</citation>. Amidst the jubilant celebrations of Assad's defeat, there remains a discernible undercurrent of uncertainty concerning the new power dynamics and ongoing humanitarian needs. The fall of Damascus concludes a chapter in Syria's history, yet it opens another, fraught with challenges and the hope for a sustainable and inclusive future <citation>https://www.cbgabd.org/2024/12/10/the-fall-of-damascus-how-opposition-forces-toppled-assads-stronghold/</citation>.\n### Government withdrawal and SDF advances\n\nThe Citadel of Aleppo, an ancient fortress, stands as a testament to the city's rich strategic and cultural heritage. Historically, it served as a formidable military outpost due to its elevated vantage point, offering control over the surrounding landscape. This strategic significance has been acknowledged through centuries of conflict, from ancient times to the Crusades and up into modern warfare scenarios <citation>https://syriascopetravel.com/aleppo-citadel-syrias-treasure/</citation> <citation>https://thebrainchamber.com/the-citadel-of-aleppo/</citation>.\n\nIn recent times, Aleppo has once again emerged as a focal point in the Syrian conflict. The Government's withdrawal from key areas and the subsequent advances by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) epitomize this shift in control. Notably, in 2016, there was significant turmoil as rebel factions captured vast areas of Aleppo, leading to strategic recalibrations by the Syrian regime and its allies <citation>https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/22/middleeast/syrian-regime-takes-full-control-of-aleppo/index.html</citation>.\n\nThe ongoing Operation Dawn of Freedom led by the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) further underscores the city's tactical importance. This operation, aimed at intercepting SDF supply networks and establishing Turkish influence, highlighted the intertwining military and geopolitical objectives in Northern Syria <citation>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/op-dawn-of-freedom.htm</citation>. The SNA has also made significant territorial gains, including the capture of towns such as Tadef and Manbij, reflecting a broader strategic ambition to influence Syrian territorial dynamics <citation>https://levant24.com/news/national/2024/11/sna-launches-dawn-of-freedom-operation</citation>.\n\nAs the conflict progresses, the implications of these shifts are multifold, affecting not only military strategies but also the humanitarian situation in the region, shaping the future trajectory of governance and control in Aleppo and its surrounding territories.\n### Opening Advances\n\nIn recent weeks, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) alongside allied factions, have launched a powerful offensive in Syria, notably advancing in the Aleppo and Idlib regions. This series of strategic operations has led to the capture of 22 villages in Aleppo and the Idlib countryside, as HTS successfully broadened its territories while opening new fronts along the Saraqib axis <citation>https://www.hawarnews.com/en/hts-mercenaries-seize-22-villages-in-aleppo-idlib-countryside</citation>. These developments were complemented by the capture of the strategically significant 46th Regiment base near Aleppo. The success of such operations has not only shifted the balance of power in the region but also highlights the increasing capabilities of HTS in terms of military logistics and combat tactics <citation>https://deepnewz.com/middle-east/hts-led-offensive-captures-46th-regiment-base-near-aleppo-c0f307bb</citation>.\n\nThe implications of these captures extend beyond immediate military victories. Control over key highways like the M5 and M4, crucial corridors connecting Syria’s major cities, notably Aleppo with Damascus, further underscores the strategic acumen of HTS. This not only disrupts supply lines and governmental control but also signals potential shifts in regional dynamics, as rebel factions aim to consolidate their influence and strengthen their hold over liberated territories <citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/middle-east_ap-explains-why-syrias-m5-assads-highway-victory/6184296.html</citation>. As HTS and its allied groups continue their offensives, the situation in Syria looks increasingly complex, bringing the conflict into a new phase with ongoing regional and international reverberations.\n### Domestic\n\nThe domestic situation in Syria is profoundly influenced by the Syrian government's ideological and strategic positioning since the onset of the conflict in 2011. The government has consistently labeled opposition forces as terrorists, a narrative designed to delegitimize the insurgency and justify military responses aimed at establishing control [9]. This perspective is bolstered by the support of key allies such as Iran and Russia, who have provided indispensable military and political backing.\n\nIran and Russia's involvement extends beyond military support; it is fundamental to the government's survival and strategic operations. Russian and Iranian contributions have facilitated the recapture of territories once held by opposition factions and enabled the Syrian government to maintain its presence in strategically vital regions [6]. The importance of these regions, particularly those with strong Alawite support like Latakia and Tartous, underscores the government's efforts to secure internal stability through a robust counterinsurgency approach [4].\n\nThe Syrian government's perspective on domestic conflict is intertwined with broader geopolitical interests. The relationship with its allies directly influences internal policy and the conduct of military operations, reinforcing the government's narrative against insurgency and terrorism [10]. Aligning with these foreign powers not only solidifies internal control but also projects the image of a resilient state combating terrorism, thereby justifying continued military engagement domestically and internationally.\n\nThrough its domestic policies, the Syrian government aims to assert control, project strength, and maintain allegiance from both local and international actors. This is pivotal not only for its internal stability but also for securing continued international support from its allies, crucial in the face of mounting challenges from insurgent forces.\n\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nAs of late December 2024, a ceasefire between Turkey and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) remained tenuously intact around the northern Syrian city of Manbij. According to the Pentagon, the ceasefire was holding despite underlying tensions and sporadic violations. This fragile peace was seen as a result of complex negotiations between involved parties, including significant pressure and brokering efforts from the United States <citation>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/ceasefire-between-turkey-us-backed-sdf-northern-syria-holding-pentagon-says-2024-12-30/</citation>. \n\nHowever, the ceasefire's stability varied considerably across different regions. Reports indicate that while some areas experienced relative calm, others witnessed renewed hostilities as the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) terminated the US-mediated ceasefire, leading to increased skirmishes with Kurdish-led forces. The breaking of the truce by these factions was influenced by deep-seated opposition to Kurdish self-governance in northern Syria, with Turkish authorities likening entities like the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (DAANES) to security threats, thereby justifying their military campaigns <citation>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/12/turkey-backed-syrian-factions-end-us-mediated-ceasefire-kurdish-led-sdf</citation>.\n\nPolitical and military tensions were further exacerbated by the potential for larger military buildups, notably near the strategic town of Kobani. Concerns arose over Turkey preparing for a possible incursion, significantly alarming the international community and raising fears of escalated conflict <citation>https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-833777</citation>. Despite the tenuous calm in some regions, the fragile nature of the ceasefire and the conflicting interests of involved parties suggested that a return to wider conflict was an ever-present danger, underscoring the complexity of achieving lasting peace in the region <citation>https://www.firstpost.com/world/syria-despite-fragile-ceasefire-extension-21-pro-turkey-fighters-killed-13845763.html</citation>.\n\nAmid these tensions, the role of external mediation was critical. The United States, acknowledging the sensitivity of the situation, strove to maintain the ceasefire through diplomatic engagement, although they faced challenges from differing interpretations and commitments by the involved factions <citation>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/11/us-ceasefire-deal-kurdish-fighters-turkey-rebels/</citation>. As the ceasefire's aftermath unfolded, it became evident that sustainable peace would require not just immediate cessation of hostilities but also addressing the underlying political grievances and strategic rivalries that continued to fuel unrest.",
