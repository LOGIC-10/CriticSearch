The Speaker may be appointed from outside the National Assembly <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>.\n\nThe 2019 election saw the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) win a majority with 38 of the 57 seats being voted on <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/4357/</citation>. Voter turnout was 84% <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/4357/</citation>.

Overall voter turnout was 79% in the 2024 elections <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82973</citation>.\n\nPrior to 2023, the National Assembly saw instances of floor crossing. For example, two BDP MPs and two UDC MPs defected to the UDC and BDP, respectively <citation>https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/2024_Botswana_general_election</citation>.

Businesses, particularly those in manufacturing and agriculture, warned of severe challenges and suggested a phased implementation of the minimum wage increase <citation>https://thevoicebw.com/business-botswana-not-ready-for-p4k-minimum-wage/</citation>.\n\nOther parties, such as the Botswana Congress Party (BCP), also presented their manifestos, with the BCP focusing on improving lives through a high-wage economy and democratic governance <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82075</citation>.\n## Election date and timeline\n\nThe Botswana general election was held on October 30, 2024 <citation>https://povonews.com/botswanas-2024-general-elections-to-be-held-on-october-30/</citation><citation>https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-to-hold-elections-october-30-as-president-masisi-seeks-2nd-term-/7770173.html</citation><citation>https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2024-elections/botswana/</citation><citation>https://www.okayafrica.com/botswana-general-elections/</citation><citation>https://www.mmegi.bw/news/botswana-election-to-be-held-october-30th/news</citation><citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/30-october-is-election-day/</citation><citation>https://www.news24.com/news24/world/news/botswana-general-election-set-for-october-30-20240903</citation><citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/81548</citation><citation>https://en.sputniknews.africa/20240904/botswanas-general-election-set-for-october-30-1068142775.html</citation>.

For the first time in 58 years since independence, the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) was ousted from power <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/botswanas-ruling-party-loses-power-after-six-decades-early-results-show</citation>, as the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) secured a majority with 59.0% of the vote, securing 36 out of 61 National Assembly seats <citation>https://www.idea.int/democracytracker/report/botswana/october-2024</citation>. This election saw Duma Boko of the UDC emerge victorious, while the incumbent President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat <citation>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-opposition-party-wins-overwhelming-majority-in-botswana-election/</citation>.\n\nSeveral critical issues dominated the electoral discourse, including rising unemployment <citation>https://blog.bti-project.org/2024/08/29/a-bumpy-road-ahead-botswana-faces-economic-and-political-struggles-ahead-of-its-2024-general-elections/</citation> and a proposed minimum wage increase to P4,000 <citation>https://www.regalcapital.org/p/should-botswana-increase-minimum-wage-to-p4000</citation>, a significant jump from the existing P1,321 <citation>https://www.regalcapital.org/p/should-botswana-increase-minimum-wage-to-p4000</citation>. The UDC campaigned on a platform of \"inclusive growth and quality lives,\" promising the creation of 450,000 to 500,000 jobs <citation>https://www.pressreader.com/botswana/botswana-guardian/20241122/281608130987055</citation> and reforms in education, housing, and healthcare <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/features/umbrella-for-democratic-change-udc-manifesto-highlights/</citation>.\n\nThe peaceful transfer of power following the election has been hailed as a triumph of democracy in Southern Africa <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>, underscoring Botswana's commitment to regular democratic elections since gaining independence in 1966 <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>.

Voters rejected the long-serving governing party in what has been described as a political earthquake <citation>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c238n5zr51yo</citation>.\n\nIn terms of seat distribution, the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) secured a majority of the vote with 59.0%, gaining 36 out of the 61 elected National Assembly seats <citation>https://www.idea.int/democracytracker/report/botswana/october-2024</citation>. The Botswana Congress Party (BCP) won 15 seats <citation>https://www.idea.int/democracytracker/report/botswana/october-2024</citation>, while the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) secured five seats <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>. The BDP's share of seats drastically declined from 38 in 2019 (out of 57) to a mere 4 (out of 61 directly elected seats) in the 69-member Parliament <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>.\n\nConcerning the vote share, the UDC secured 36.9% of the total votes, surpassing the BDP, which received 30.2% <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>. The Botswana Congress Party (BCP) maintained a substantial presence with 20.7% of the votes <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>.\n\nThe Botswana Democratic Party (BDP)'s share of support dropped to 31% in the October 2024 elections, resulting in only four out of 61 constituencies <citation>https://nation.africa/africa/news/-botswana-s-election-shock-why-voters-kicked-the-ruling-party-out-after-58-years-4821024</citation>. The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) victory in the 2024 election is considered the biggest upset in the country's election history <citation>https://www.africanews.com/2024/11/01/botswana-udc-supporters-celebrate-election-win/</citation>. The Botswana Congress Party (BCP) secured 15 seats in the 2024 election <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>, while the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) won five seats <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>.\n## Voter registration\n\nIn Botswana, every citizen aged 18 years and above is eligible to register to vote in National and Local Government elections <citation>https://www.wikiprocedure.com/index.php?title=Botswana_-_Obtain_a_Voters_card</citation>, <citation>https://www.iec.gov.bw/index.php/elections.html</citation>. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) conducts voter registration, a process which involves eligible citizens verifying their inclusion on the voter's roll or registering to be added <citation>https://www.gov.bw/voting/voter-registration</citation>.\n\nThe voter registration for the 2024 general elections began on January 5 and concluded on February 3, 2024 <citation>https://africanyouthnews.com/botswana-begins-voter-registration-for-upcoming-election-despite-challenges/</citation>, <citation>https://www.africa-press.net/botswana/all-news/voter-registration-for-next-years-general-elections-in-botswana-to-start-friday</citation>. Supplementary voter registration periods were also announced, with one running from February 26 to March 15, 2024 <citation>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/supplementary-voting-registration-2024-elections-easylaw-botswana-9hdgf</citation>. To register, citizens are required to present themselves to a Registration Officer with a valid National Identity Card (Omang) <citation>https://www.gov.bw/voting/voter-registration</citation>, <citation>https://www.wikiprocedure.com/index.php/Botswana_-_Register_as_Voter</citation>. The IEC also set up approximately 2,880 polling stations across Botswana and 48 in foreign territories to accommodate Batswana citizens living abroad <citation>https://trendsnafrica.com/voter-registration-for-2024-general-elections-starts-in-botswana/</citation>.\n\nThe IEC, however, faced several challenges during the registration process, including some registration clerks arriving late or not showing up <citation>https://guardiansun.co.bw/news/politics/voter-registration-challenges-undermine-elections-integrity</citation>. There was also a surge in illegal voter registrations <citation>https://apadiaspora.net/botswana-poll-body-warns-of-surge-in-voter-registration-irregularities/</citation>. To combat this, the IEC dispelled fears of electoral fraud related to recent ID issues, stating that multiple registrations and underage registrants are common mistakes that will be addressed through voter roll inspections <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/iec-dispels-electoral-fraud-in-recent-id-issues/</citation>. The IEC also postponed the voter registration process to ensure quality registration <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/74700</citation>.\n### Background of opposition parties before the election\n\nThe 2024 Botswana general election saw a number of opposition parties vying for power, most notably the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), the Botswana Congress Party (BCP), the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), and the Alliance for Progressives (AP) <citation>https://www.africa-press.net/botswana/all-news/botswanas-political-landscape-gearing-up-for-the-2024-general-election</citation>. The UDC is a coalition of left-leaning parties aiming to unseat the BDP <citation>https://www.theafricareport.com/366164/botswanas-presidential-election-meet-the-candidates/</citation>. Led by Duma Boko, the UDC was formed in 2012 by three political parties: the Botswana National Front, the Botswana Movement for Democracy, and the Botswana People's Party <citation>https://yourbotswana.com/2024/11/12/botswanas-new-president-who-is-duma-boko-and-what-does-he-stand-for/</citation>. Boko served as the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly from 2014 to 2019 <citation>https://kids.kiddle.co/Duma_Boko</citation>. In the 2024 election, the UDC secured 36.9% of the total votes <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>.\n\nThe Botswana Congress Party (BCP) has promised to \"save Botswana\" and committed to offering an average monthly living wage of 4,000 pula <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/botswana-election-who-is-in-the-running-and-whats-at-stake</citation>. Dumelang Saleshando is the leader of the BCP <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/botswana-election-who-is-in-the-running-and-whats-at-stake</citation>. The BCP secured 15 seats in the 2024 election <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>.\n\nThe Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) was formed by ex-President Ian Khama's followers <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/botswana-election-who-is-in-the-running-and-whats-at-stake</citation> just before the 2019 election <citation>https://nation.africa/africa/news/-botswana-s-election-shock-why-voters-kicked-the-ruling-party-out-after-58-years-4821024</citation>. Mephato Reatile leads the BPF <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/botswana-election-who-is-in-the-running-and-whats-at-stake</citation>. The BPF won five seats in the 2024 election <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>.\n\nThe Alliance for Progressives (AP) is a dynamic and forward-thinking political movement dedicated to transforming Botswana into a nation of equal opportunities, inclusive growth, and sustainable prosperity <citation>https://www.ap.org.bw/about/</citation>.\n\nFormer President Ian Khama split from the BDP and supported the BPF <citation>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c238n5zr51yo</citation>.\n### Composition of parliament\n\nThe Botswana National Assembly is a unicameral legislature. The most recent 2024 election and preceding years have seen some shifts in its composition. The new legislature consists of 69 members <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>, an increase from the previous 65. This number includes 61 directly elected members <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation> who are chosen through a First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>, six specially elected members who are indirectly elected by the National Assembly <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>, and two *ex officio* members: the President and the Speaker <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>. The Speaker may be appointed from outside the National Assembly <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>.\n\nThe 2019 election saw the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) win a majority with 38 of the 57 seats being voted on <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/4357/</citation>. Voter turnout was 84% <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/4357/</citation>. However, the 2024 election resulted in a significant shift in power, ending the BDP's 58-year rule <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>. The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) secured 36 seats <citation>https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/elections/election-results-october-through-december-2024/</citation>, while the BDP's representation plummeted to just 4 seats <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>. The Botswana Congress Party (BCP) secured 15 seats and the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) won five seats <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>. Overall voter turnout was 79% in the 2024 elections <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82973</citation>.\n\nPrior to 2023, the National Assembly saw instances of floor crossing. For example, two BDP MPs and two UDC MPs defected to the UDC and BDP, respectively <citation>https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/2024_Botswana_general_election</citation>. To address this, a ban on floor crossing was implemented in 2023, mandating that MPs resign if they switch parties mid-term <citation>https://www.africa-press.net/botswana/all-news/floor-crossing-ban-reshapes-political-accountability</citation>. This amendment aims to stabilize governance and respect voter mandates <citation>https://www.africa-press.net/botswana/all-news/floor-crossing-ban-reshapes-political-accountability</citation>.\n\nNotably, Yandani Boko resigned from his position as MP for Mahalapye East during this period <citation>https://africabrief.substack.com/p/youngest-botswana-mp-resigns-rumors</citation>.\n\nIn the 2024 parliamentary elections, only 28 women stood for parliament out of 258 contestants, representing 10.85% of the total candidates. Only three women won their seats, representing 4.92% of the 61 seats <citation>https://www.africa-press.net/botswana/all-news/women-in-botswana-make-up-54-of-voters-but-less-than-10-of-parliament-political-parties-can-change-that</citation>.\n### Previous election\n\nThe 2019 Botswana General Election, held on October 23, 2019, marked the 12th consecutive win for the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) since the country's independence in 1966 <citation>https://yourbotswana.com/2019/10/27/he-mokgweetsi-masisi-bdp-wins-botswana-2019-general-election/</citation>. This victory secured President Mokgweetsi Masisi's mandate to implement the BDP's promises <citation>https://yourbotswana.com/2019/10/27/he-mokgweetsi-masisi-bdp-wins-botswana-2019-general-election/</citation>.\n\nKey political parties in the 2019 election included the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), and the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) <citation>http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2041_E.htm</citation>.\n\nThe Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) secured a majority, winning 38 out of the 57 contested seats <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/52572</citation>. The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) won 15 seats <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20191023/</citation>, the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) won 3, and the Alliance for Progressives (AP) won 1 <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/52572</citation>.\n\nVoter turnout was significant, with 84% of registered voters participating <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/29/</citation>, representing 777,943 votes cast <citation>https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fluctuating+voting+trends+in+Botswana.-a0779611920</citation>. 925,478 people registered to vote in 2019 <citation>https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/29/</citation>.\n\nThe election saw some controversies, including concerns about the fairness of the electoral system <citation>https://www.academia.edu/40308652/The_2019_Elections_in_Botswana_Context_History_and_Future_Chris_Brown</citation> and allegations of double voting <citation>https://www.biznews.com/global-citizen/2019/12/05/botswana-election-rigged-forensics-justice</citation>. The Electoral Amendment Act of 2016, introducing electronic voting, also caused controversy <citation>https://freedomhouse.org/country/botswana/freedom-world/2019</citation>.\n\nFormer President Ian Khama's strained relationship with his successor, Mokgweetsi Masisi, significantly impacted the 2019 elections, with Khama supporting the opposition in an attempt to unseat Masisi and the BDP <citation>https://converis.ub.bw/converis/portal/detail/Publication/9692048?lang=en_GB</citation>.\n\nInternational observer missions, such as the ECF-SADC, were present to observe the election <citation>https://www.eisa.org/pdf/bot2019ecf.pdf</citation> and hailed the polls as credible and a fair reflection of the will of the people <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/52573</citation>.\n\nFollowing the election, the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) challenged the results in court, focusing on 16 parliamentary constituencies won by the BDP <citation>https://www.reuters.com/article/world/botswana-opposition-challenges-election-result-in-court-idUSKBN1Y00QO/</citation>.\n### Seat redistribution\n\nBotswana employs a First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) majority system for both National Assembly and Local Government elections <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>. This system dictates that the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins the seat <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>. Following the October 30, 2024, general election <citation>https://www.princetonpoliticalreview.org/international-news/botswanas-political-shake-up-what-the-ruling-partys-historic-loss-means-for-democracy-in-sadc</citation>, the seat distribution in the National Assembly saw a dramatic shift. The Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) emerged as the leading party, securing 36 of the 61 directly elected seats <citation>https://www.idea.int/democracytracker/report/botswana/october-2024</citation>, marking a significant increase from the 15 seats they held after the 2019 election <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20191023/</citation>. The Botswana Congress Party (BCP) won 15 seats <citation>https://www.idea.int/democracytracker/report/botswana/october-2024</citation>, while the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) secured 5 seats <citation>https://www.idea.int/democracytracker/report/botswana/october-2024</citation>. The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which had dominated Botswana's politics since 1969 <citation>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/botswana-election-who-is-in-the-running-and-whats-at-stake</citation>, experienced a historic defeat, plummeting to just 4 seats <citation>https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/elections/election-results-october-through-december-2024/</citation> from 38 in 2019 <citation>https://data.ipu.org/parliament/BW/BW-LC01/election/BW-LC01-E20241030/</citation>.\n\nThis outcome highlights the potential disparities that can arise under the FPTP electoral system, where a party can win the majority of seats without necessarily securing the majority of total votes cast <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>. For example, in the 2024 election, the UDC won with 36.9% of the total votes, while the BDP secured 30.2% <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>. As an alternative, a Proportional Representation (PR) system would allocate seats more closely mirroring the actual voter preferences <citation>https://www.tdghrconsults.com/post/botswana-s-2024-election-milestone-and-the-quest-for-true-representation</citation>, potentially leading to a more representative legislature.\n### MPs not standing for re-election\n\nThe 2024 Botswana general election saw a number of Members of Parliament not standing for re-election for various reasons. Some MPs' political careers came to an end due to losses in primary elections, while others opted for retirement <citation>https://thepatriot.co.bw/adios-to-retiring-mps/</citation>. For instance, in the Gaborone North constituency, the incumbent MP, Mpho Balopi, had announced that he would not seek re-election in the 2024 general elections <citation>https://www.thegazette.news/news/animosity-rises-as-bdp-primaries-near/</citation>. Similarly, Dr. Thapelo Matsheka, the Member of Parliament for Lobatse, decided not to seek re-election in the coming general elections <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/80969</citation>. He expressed his gratitude to the people of Lobatse for the opportunity to represent them <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/80969</citation>. Additionally, Pono Moatlhodi, the Tonota Member of Parliament, fueled speculation surrounding his political future and did not contest the 2024 election <citation>https://www.pressreader.com/botswana/mmegi/20230804/281595245044445</citation>. Eric Molale, Good Hope/Mabule constituency MP, also announced that he would not be seeking re-election in this year's general elections <citation>https://www.africa-press.net/botswana/all-news/molale-bids-constituents-farewell</citation>. The exodus, particularly by MPs from the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), was spurred by losses in the Bulela Ditswe primary elections, paving the way for new faces <citation>https://thepatriot.co.bw/adios-to-retiring-mps/</citation>.\n### Presidential nominees\n\nThe nomination of presidential candidates in Botswana is a process governed by a specific legal framework and involves several key steps. The primary legal documents outlining this process are Sections 30-35 of the Botswana Constitution of 1966 <citation>https://www.lawglobalhub.com/section-30-35-botswana-constitution-1966/</citation> and the Presidential Elections (Supplementary Provisions) Act <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/81985</citation>, <citation>https://botswanalaws.com/StatutesActpdf/1969Actpdf/PRESIDENTIAL+ELECTIONS+(SUPPLEMENTARY+PROVISIONS)+ACT,+41+OF+1969.pdf</citation>, <citation>https://botswanalaws.com/consolidated-statutes/principle-legislation/presidential-elections-supplementary-provisions</citation>.\n\nNomination day is a critical date, statutorily defined as the first Saturday following the expiry of 20 days after each dissolution of the National Assembly <citation>https://botswanalaws.com/StatutesActpdf/1969Actpdf/PRESIDENTIAL+ELECTIONS+(SUPPLEMENTARY+PROVISIONS)+ACT,+41+OF+1969.pdf</citation>. On this day, nominations must be delivered to the returning officer <citation>https://www.lawglobalhub.com/section-30-35-botswana-constitution-1966/</citation>, who is then responsible for examining the nomination papers <citation>https://www.iec.gov.bw/images/Presidential+Elections+Supplementary+Provisions+ch02-01.pdf</citation> to ensure they meet the legal requirements outlined in section 5 of the Presidential Elections (Supplementary Provisions) Act <citation>https://www.iec.gov.bw/images/Presidential+Elections+Supplementary+Provisions+ch02-01.pdf</citation>.\n\nA key requirement for a valid presidential nomination is demonstrating sufficient support. According to the law, a nomination is not valid unless it is supported in the manner prescribed <citation>https://www.lawglobalhub.com/section-30-35-botswana-constitution-1966/</citation>. Presidential candidates must provide proof to the chief justice that they have the required number of supporters to be eligible to run <citation>https://yourbotswana.com/2024/10/01/botswana-leader-3-from-opposition-confirmed-as-presidential-candidates/</citation>. This includes being accompanied by 1,000 nomination forms, verified and officially stamped by Botswana Police Station commanders stationed at various constituencies across the country <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/81985</citation>.\n\nThe Chief Justice plays a significant role in the nomination process, primarily by confirming the candidates after reviewing their applications <citation>https://sundiatapost.com/4-nominees-submit-application-for-botswana-presidency-election-body/</citation>.\n\nThe Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is responsible for the overall conduct and supervision of elections <citation>https://www.gov.bw/ministries/independent-electoral-commission</citation>, ensuring that the elections are conducted efficiently, properly, freely, and fairly <citation>https://www.gov.bw/ministries/independent-electoral-commission</citation>.\nTo be nominated, candidates must produce an official receipt of P500.00 for election to the National Assembly or P100.00 in the case of election to a Council, or deposit the said amounts in cash with the Returning Officer <citation>https://www.iec.gov.bw/index.php/parties-and-candidates.html</citation>.\n### Observation controversy\n\nThe 2024 Botswana general elections saw significant participation from various observer groups, both international and local, reflecting a commitment to ensuring the integrity and transparency of the electoral process. The Electoral Commissions Forum for SADC Countries (ECF-SADC) <citation>https://www.ecfsadc.org/preliminary-statement-of-the-ecf-sadc-election-observation-mission-to-the-general-elections-of-the-republic-of-botswana/</citation> and the SADC Electoral Observation Mission (SEOM) <citation>https://www.sadc.int/latest-news/sadc-electoral-observation-mission-seom-2024-general-elections-republic-botswana</citation> were deployed to observe the pre-election phase, polling day, and post-election processes. Locally, the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) formed \"Madibelatlhopho,\" a vigilante group, to monitor voter registration, alleging potential rigging <citation>https://africaelects.com/2024/10/28/botswana-inside-the-countrys-most-competitive-election-to-date/</citation>. The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) also observed the elections <citation>https://www.zesn.org.zw/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ZESN-ESN-SA-Botswana-Election-Report.pdf</citation>.\n\nHowever, the voter registration process was marked by considerable controversy. A significant point of contention was the UDC's demand to deploy its observers across the country, a move initially resisted by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) <citation>https://africabrief.substack.com/p/botswana-electoral-turmoil-deepens</citation>. This disagreement led to a legal battle, with the UDC taking the IEC to court to secure the right to monitor the registration process <citation>https://trendsnafrica.com/voter-registration-for-2024-general-elections-starts-in-botswana/</citation>. The IEC's opposition stemmed from the absence of specific legal provisions mandating the presence of party agents during voter registration <citation>https://enews.mmegi.bw/article/281573770483750</citation>.\n\nThe legal dispute resulted in multiple postponements of the voter registration exercise <citation>https://trendsnafrica.com/voter-registration-for-2024-general-elections-starts-in-botswana/</citation><citation>https://africabrief.substack.com/p/botswana-electoral-turmoil-deepens</citation>. The High Court ruled in favor of the UDC, granting them the right to observe and monitor the process, including recording names and ID numbers of registrants <citation>https://guardiansun.co.bw/news/politics/iec-postpones-voter-registration-process</citation>. Subsequently, the IEC appealed the High Court ruling <citation>https://www.gabzfm.com/post/iec-appeals-court-order-allowing-udc-to-monitor-voter-registration</citation>. Despite these challenges, voter registration eventually commenced on January 5 and concluded on February 3, 2024 <citation>https://english.news.cn/20231231/574ef47489eb4622a2bca5971272ea17/c.html</citation>. Preliminary statements from observer missions indicated that the 2024 general elections were conducted in a free and peaceful atmosphere <citation>https://dailynews.gov.bw/news-detail/82930</citation>.",
