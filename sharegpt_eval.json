Persian is an Indo-European language that serves as the official language of Iran. In Afghanistan, Persian is spoken as **Dari** (often referred to as Afghan Persian), which is one of the two official languages, alongside Pashto.\n\nWhile **Farsi** and **Dari** are essentially dialects of the same language and are mutually intelligible, there are some differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, and, to a lesser extent, grammar. These differences are similar to the variations in dialects between British English and American English, for example. The core grammar and structure of both Farsi and Dari remain largely the same, but the words, expressions, and accents can differ.\n\n### Key differences:\n- **Pronunciation**: Certain vowels and consonants are pronounced differently in Farsi and Dari.\n- **Vocabulary**: While the basic vocabulary is the same, there are some unique words in Dari that are not used in Iranian Farsi and vice versa. Some words may also be influenced by the languages spoken in the region, such as Pashto, Uzbek, and Arabic in Afghanistan.\n- **Script**: Both Farsi and Dari are written in the Persian script, which is a variant of the Arabic script, but there are some orthographic differences due to regional variations.\n\nIn short, while people in both countries speak the same language family (Persian), the versions of the language spoken in Iran and Afghanistan have distinct regional flavors."
